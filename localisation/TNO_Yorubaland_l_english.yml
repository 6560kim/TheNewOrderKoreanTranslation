 POLITICS_LADOKE_AKINTOLA_DESC:0 "요루바랜드는 항상 자유롭지 못했습니다. 카메룬의 범아프리카 민족주의자들에 묶여 독립을 주창해야 했으며, 그 운동의 중심에는 라도체 아킨톨라가 있었습니다. 장군들과 장교들로 이루어진 내부 모임이 일어나 그의 조국을 뒤집어 사회주의 정권이 종식되면서, 쿠데타 집단과 젠트랄아프리카 사이의 교전을 기회로 받아들인 아킨톨라는 독립파의 지도자이자 주요 인사로 올라섰습니다. Under his command, the Cameroonians were driven out, and since then Yorubaland has managed to hold off any attacks made by them to reclaim their lost lands. And the nations of West Africa are thankful for that, for they are shielded from the pan-Africanists and can continue living in peace.\n\nHowever, things are not as clear and hopeful in Akintola's domain itself. The people admire him, and are thankful that he is there to safeguard the coast from any foreign invaders. And while he may he a dictator, he is not a brutal or a militaristic one, but rules benevolently over his citizens. This despotism will eventually have to end, though. Of course, the last thing he would want would be for the socialists to take power, even though he himself is implementing policies surprisingly similar to their own. Welfare has been established, and many freedoms have been given. As for actual elections, that is a complicated matter for Akintola. Perhaps a number of selected parties could participate in an electoral process, but how can he be so sure that his successors will be able to hold the country together, without the coast of Yorubaland falling to his enemies. He is not, and that is why installing democracy may not be that easy. For now, though, Akintola is content to continue his rule over the strip of land he can control, even if only to keep his enemies out."
