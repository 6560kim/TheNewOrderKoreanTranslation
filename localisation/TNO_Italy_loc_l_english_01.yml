 #GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS#
 ITA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "최근 이탈리아의 역사는 승리와 패배의 연속이었습니다. 유럽 추축의 작은 파트너인 이탈리아는 독일의 2중대로 싸우며 발칸 반도에서 트롤짓을 계속하다 이집트에서 믿을 수 없는 승리를 거두었습니다. 곧이어 아틀란트로파의 재앙에서 살아남아 엄청난 양의 석유 매장지를 보유하게 된 이탈리아는 곧 그들 자신이 과도하게 팽창된 분열된 제국이라는 사실을 깨닫게 되었습니다. 치아노의 지도하에서 파시즘의 기풍은 사라지고 있는 것처럼 보이지만, 그마저도 환상일 수 있습니다 - 그리고 많은 사람들은 이탈리아가 세계 열강의 반열에 급속도로 올라간 것처럼 급속도로 떨어질 수도 있다는 사실을 두려워하고 있습니다."
 IEA_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "이탈리아령 동아프리카는 이탈리아 제국의 첫 정복지은 아니었지만, 확실히 가장 자랑스러운 정복지입니다. 에티오피아 산맥의 꼭대기에서 소말리아의 야자수 해안까지, 동아프리카는 끝없는 곡식의 들판, 금과 다른 광물을 품고 있는 헤아릴 수 없는 광맥, 충성스럽고 열심히 일하는 원주민, 그리고 정의롭고 명예로운 행정가들의 고향입니다. 적어도 이탈리아 언론이 선전하는 바에 따르면요. 사실, 동아프리카는 총독 아메데오 디 사보이-아오스타의 적절한 관리에도 불구하고 거의 제 기능을 못하고 있습니다. 반군과 파르티잔들은 여전히 이 지역의 산과 숲을 떠돌고 있고, 막대한 부에도 불구하고, 이 지역의 경제는 부패의 늪에서 발전하기 위해 고군분투하고 있습니다. 이탈리아 제국의 왕관 보석은 금이 가기 시작했고, 많은 사람들은 이탈리아가 가장 소중한 정복지를 포기하고 싶어 하지 않든 그것을 결국 포기해야 할 것이라 믿고 있습니다..."
 IME_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "제2차 세계대전 동안 이탈리아 제국이 무서운 속도로 팽창했을 때, 파시스트 지도자들은 아무도 새로 점령한 영토들이 문제를 일으킬 것이라고는 상상하지 못했습니다. 레반트에서는 이탈리아의 통치가 원주민들의 거센 반발로 끊임없이 얼룩지고 있으며, 유대계 이민자들을 통해 원주민들과의 균형을 맞추려는 당국의 계획을 알아차린 시오니즘 단체들도 이탈리아에 맞서 무기를 들면서 역효과를 낳았습니다. 젊은 달라 치에사 신임 주지사는 새로운 전략을 채택했는데, 양측 온건파들과 협상하는 것을 골자로 한 이 전략은 이탈리아인, 하가나인과 파타인 사이에 불안정한 평화를 정착시켰습니다. 터키의 위협이 다가오고 있고, 이는 레반트인들을 단합시키거나, 이 지역을 혼란에 몰아넣을 수도 있을 것입니다."
 EGY_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "세계 문명의 중심지로서의 이집트의 시대는 길고, 오래되었지만, 파루크 왕은 성공한 것으로 보이기 위해선 성공해야 한다는 점을 잘 알고 있으며, 빠른 자동차와 캐비어보다 성공을 더 잘 나타내는 게 있을까요? 그의 나라가 그의 미식 비용을 감당할 수 있으면 말입니다... 장기적으로 볼 때 논쟁의 여지가 있지만, 세금이 지불되고 곡물이 운송되는 한, 이집트의 이탈리아 주인들은 왕의 사치에는 별로 개의치 않습니다. 불행히도, 혁명적인 열정이나 반동적인 광신이라는 이름으로 왕의 통치에 반대하는 많은 사람들이 있지만, 양측 모두 실권을 휘두르는 지도자보단 춤과 마차를 좋아하는 국왕을 선호합니다. 축제의 결말이 나고 금빛 폐허 위에 태양이 떠오르고 있습니다. 당신은 이집트를 진정한 번영의 세기로 이끌 힘과 권위를 가지고 있습니까?"
 IRQ_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "이라크는 이탈리아 세력권 내의 수많은 전제국과 식민지 중 특이한 사례입니다. 이라크를 제국의 꼭두각시 국가로 통합하려는 이탈리아의 시도가 혁명 이후 비참하게 실패하자, 로마는 바그다드에 자치권을 부여하는 걸 받아들일 수밖에 없었고, 이라크는 적어도 명목상으로는 현재 중동에서 몇 안 되는 진정한 민주주의 국가 중 하나가 되었습니다. 이라크 정부는 권위주의적 민주주의로 운영되는데, 이는 태양 아래 있는 모든 의욕 있는 정당들이 석유에 대한 이탈리아의 지배나 아브드 알-카림 카심과 민주당에 반기를 들지 않는 한 자유로운 활동을 보장받는다는 의미입니다. 그러나 이 체제는 마치 카드로 만든 집으로, 음모론자들은 모든 방향에서 이라크와 지도자를 위협하고 있습니다. 모든 것이 무너졌을 때, 누가 잿더미에서 일어날까요?"
 ILG_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "이탈리아 제국은 많은 부분에서 합법적인 독립체입니다. 적의 항복 이후 나치는 단순히 그들이 원하는 것을 가져갔고, 이탈리아는 명예롭게 전리품을 얻었습니다. 알제리를 제외하고요. 로마에서 멀리 떨어져 있는 제국의 서부 변경인 이탈리아령 알제리의 역사는 - 붕괴하고 있는 프랑스국의 영토였던 곳에서 새로운 정착지를 찾고 있었던 몇몇의 정착민으로부터 시작했습니다. 곧이어 이탈리아의 동맹인 이베리아가 원주민 뇌물과 무장 급습으로 이 지역에 영향력을 끼치려고 시도했습니다. 현재 이탈리아령 알제리는 알제리 원주민들과의 불안한 동맹관계에 의존하고 있는 임시 군사정부에 의해 통제되고 있고, 또한 이베리아인들과 그들의 동맹인 피에누아르 민병대와의 긴장이 고조되고 있습니다. 트리움비라투스가 무너진다면, 어느 제국이 알제리를 장악할 것이며, 얼마나 많이 그들의 통치를 받기 위해 기꺼이 남아줄까요?"
 CRO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "그 시작부터 크로아티아 독립국은 웃음거리였습니다. 제 2차 세계대전으로 탄생한 이탈리아인 국왕이 이끄는 추축국 꼭두각시 정부는 실질적으로는 잔악무도한 우스타샤와 안테 파벨리치의 손에 달려 있었습니다. 추축국이 분열되고 파벨리치가 죽으면서 이탈리아 제국은 크로아티아에 대한 지배권을 재확인하여 우스타샤를 축출하고 왕국을 이탈리아인 장군들과 조언가들의 손에 맡겼습니다. 국가 내부에는 아직도 파르티잔 활동이 왕성하며, 왕국에는 종말이 다가오고 있습니다. 좋은 쪽으로든 나쁜 쪽으로든 변화는 찾아오고 있습니다."
 GRE_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "그리스국은 2차 세계대전의 잿더미에서 태어났고, 이 새로운 시대에도 여전히 유럽이 분쟁에 휩싸였을 때와 같은 문제를 겪고 있습니다. 매우 인기가 없고 민주적이지 않은 정부인 그리스의 최근 역사는 어떤 식으로든 국가를 개혁하거나 자유화하지 못한 것이 특징인데, 수많은 파르티잔 조직들을 통제하기 위한 트리움비라투스 부대들의 강력한 존재만으로 국가가 유지되는 상황입니다. 하지만, 총리의 건강이 나빠짐에 따라, 위기는 피할 수 없을 것이며, 유럽 문명의 요람은 곧 다시 한번 전쟁에 휩싸일 지도 모릅니다. 그리스는 잿더미에서 봉황으로 부활할 수 있을까요, 아니면 수십 년의 어둠에 다시금 휩싸이게 될까요?"
 SAU_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "초라한 시작을 거쳐, 알 사우드 가문은 아라비아 반도 전역의 지배적인 세력 중 하나가 되었습니다. 제2차 세계 대전이 모든 것을 바꾸었을 때, 아라비아의 모든 것은 그대로였습니다. 회의와 악수를 통해, 사우디 왕족들은 이탈리아 제국의 날개 아래 독립을 유지했고, 석유 덕분에 아라비아는 이탈리아 세력권에서 로마의 군대가 주둔하지 않은 유일한 곳이 될 수 있었습니다. 이탈리아와의 석유 거래 덕분에, 사우디 가문은 엄청나게 부유해졌고, 그들은 자신들의 부를 유용하게 사용할 작정입니다. 아랍과 이슬람 세계의 많은 사람들은 리야드를 서방의 제국주의에 대한 이슬람의 봉화로 보고 있으며, 사우디는 이탈리아 압제자들과의 싸움을 주도하고 마침내 신자들의 지도자로서의 진정한 소명을 성취할 때를 조용히 기다리고 있습니다."

ita_the_second_verona_congress_new_desc:0 "치아노가 실각한 후 새로운 두체가 가까스로 집권했고, 이미 당내에서 분쟁이 일고 있습니다. PNF 내의 변화의 바람에 이끌려, 몇몇 고위 당 대표들은 베로나에서 제2차 회의를 소집하기로 결정했는데, 그들은 스코르자가 기꺼이 회의에 참여할 것이라 확신하고 있습니다. 그들의 목표는 1922년 파시스트 혁명의 불씨를 되살리는 것을 목표로 하는 개혁과 대책의 프로그램을 마련하는 것인데, 현재 치아노를 중심으로 모여든 반동주의자들과 자유주의자들은 권력에서 멀어진 상태입니다 . 하지만, 두체는 아직 제2차 회의에 대해 공식 성명을 발표하지 않았고, 일부에 따르면, 이것은 아마도 스코르자를 굴복시키기를 원하는 PNF 당원들에 의한 얇은 베일에 싸인 권력 놀이일 가능성도 있다고 합니다. 두체로써 스코르자의 첫번째 과제는 회의를 열 것인지, 닫을 것인지 결정하는 것이 될 것입니다."
ita_approve_the_congress:0 "회의를 진행시키자"

ita_shut_down_the_congress:0 "회의를 중지시키자"
ita_shut_down_the_congress_desc:0 "The Second Verona Congress is, at best, a threatening development, and at worst, an act of treason. If the situation isn't dealt with immediately, Scorza's rule might be tarnished by an undisciplined PNF who starts to act independently of his own Duce - and we all know how it ended the last time that happened. For the sake of the nation's and the regime's stability and security, Scorza has decided to move against the Congress, declaring it unlawful, and urging the participants to leave the premises immediately and orderly. This likely won't be taken kindly by the numerous supporters of the Congress who have gathered in Verona, but it's a necessary act to reaffirm Scorza's rule."
ita_promises_of_reform_2019:0 "개혁 약속"
ita_promises_of_reform_2019_desc:0 "Despite the victory in the Second World War, many fascists within the PNF started to feel that fascism was failing to deliver what it had promised during its early days. Even worse, during the reign of Ciano, the fascist flame was at risk of being snuffed out, perhaps once and for all. However, with our newfound predominance in the Mediterranean, we can now fully reform the Italian society according to the ideals and visions of the fascist revolution. By returning to the roots of the fascist ideology, Scorza promises a sweeping transformation of the PNF, and of Italy itself."
ita_remind_them_their_duties:0 "그들의 의무를 상기시키자"
ita_remind_them_their_duties_desc:0 "The Task of Fascism Is Simple - to grant Italy the greatness it deserves. For this reason, what most matters in this moment is further solidifying the PNF's hold over the country. To do this however, it is of the utmost importance that all members of the party are strong in their faith to Scorza, for the will of the Duce is the will of the party, and of Italy. Therefore, all fascists in Italy must be reminded that now that the traitor Ciano has been ousted from a position he wrongfully occupied, their obedience and loyalty goes to the true Duce of Fascism, Carlo Scorza. Disobeying an order from the Duce is tantamount to betrayal to the fascist ideal - thus, reforms and changes will happen if and when the Duce decides it."
ita_PNF_stays_PNF:0 "당 내부의 일은 내부의 일"
ita_PNF_stays_PNF_desc:0 "While our decision to shut down the Congress has caused quite a commotion, there is no need to escalate conflict. If we keep this as an internal matter of the PNF, the situation can be resolved with little further chaos and risk of violence than if we get the other government organizations involved. Scorza has urged the high profile PNF representatives in Verona to stand down or see their status within the party threatened - at the same time, all party members who will take part in demonstrations in Verona will see their party membership suspended or revoked. Hopefully, this relatively light conduct will convince the people in Verona that the Duce is open to dialogue, even if only under his own terms."
ita_national_emergency_time:0 "국가비상사태"
ita_national_emergency_time_desc:0 "The current happenings in Verona aren't just a problem for the Duce or the PNF to deal with, but a serious threat to the stability of Italy, and therefore, a threat to all Italians. For this reason, the Duce has pressured King Umberto II into declaring a status of national emergency, for the city of Verona is currently occupied by a gang of subversives and rabble rousers who wish to remove Scorza from power as part of their petty intrigues. With this move, Scorza will most of all send a message to all dissidents in his own party - that the Duce won't stop at anything to ensure that his dominion over the party is unchallenged."
ita_back_to_san_sepolcro:0 "산 세폴크로로 돌아가자"
ita_back_to_san_sepolcro_desc:0 "The very first fascist party in Italy was the Italian Fasci of Combat, founded by Benito Mussolini on the 23rd of March, 1919, at San Sepolcro Square in Milan. This new party was a wind of true revolutionary change in the midst of an Italy suffocated by liberalism and threatened by the communist spectre. In that square, the first spark of the fascist revolution shone - we must return to that spark, to that revolutionary fervor that burned in the hearts of WWI veterans, of revolutionary syndicalists, of nationalists and of all those who wanted to see Italy and the Italian people achieve the greatness they deserved. Today marks the beginning of a new fascist revolution, for we shall return to that spark, and turn it into a great flame."
ita_controllable_reforms:0 "통제 가능한 개혁"
ita_controllable_reforms_desc:0 "While the fascist political edifice is the strongest and most adequate that Italy has ever seen, it could admittedly use some renovations. Cobwebs and dust will accumulate even in the halls of grand palaces if they're poorly kept, and under Ciano the PNF and the other fascist institutions have stagnated. For this reason, Scorza has promised to enact a series of measures to make sure that the all the fascist organizations, from the PNF to the MVSN, from the fascist syndicates to the GIL and the ONB, are brought back to their former glory and efficiency, all under the watchful eyes of himself, the Duce of Fascism."
ita_the_ghost_of_mussolini:0 "무솔리니의 유령"
ita_the_ghost_of_mussolini_desc:0 "Asserting that the fascist system needs reforms implies that it's perfectible - but the fact that it's perfectible implies that it's imperfect. As it should be evident to all sensible fascists, suggesting that the fascist system is imperfect is very close to ideological treason. All this talk of change, even when spoken by well meaning fascists, is a crack in the edifice through which treason, deceit and intrigue might easily slip in. Shouldn't we instead took pride in what we already have achieved, instead of always striving to make changes that might pervert the fascist ideals? Shouldn't we be proud of our Mare Nostrum, of the greatness of Mussolini, and now of the greatness of Scorza, who is all but a second Mussolini?"
ita_we_can_talk_this_out:0 "우리는 이 문제를 논의할 수 있다"
ita_we_can_talk_this_out_desc:0 "The situation in Verona might be serious, but it is not yet hopeless. The Duce has insisted that the Congress will be disbanded, but that violence will only be used as a last resort, and that for the sake of the party and of Italy, he is willing to negotiate with all the representatives of the PNF who are in Verona. While negotiating from a position of strength, Scorza hopes to reaffirm his rule over the party without having to resort to violence - but it's possible that the people in Verona aren't willing to negotiate at all, taking the Duce's unwillingness to use force as a sign of weakness."
ita_surrounding_verona:0 "베로나 포위"
ita_surrounding_verona_desc:0 "While it's true that violence is best avoided, sometimes a little show of force is necessary to get one's point across. The Duce has ordered MVSN and public order units to move in strategic locations around the city of Verona, effectively putting the city under siege, blocking anyone from entering or leaving the central parts of the urban area. The Duce's goal is to make the people at the Congress feel trapped and defenseless, and if that is successful, there's no doubt that they will be much more willing to listen to our arguments, and actually stand down."
ita_storimg_verona:0 "베로나 기습"
ita_storimg_verona_desc:0 "Against such a blatant and open display of insubordination, or even worse treason, there can be only one answer - repression. After strong arming the king into giving him permission, the Duce has ordered MVSN and Regio Esercito units to take positions around Verona, mobilizing to retake the city by storm from those who unlawfully occupied it. This will undoubtedly lead to some resistance from the people at the Congress, but we're confident that the majority of them will simply surrender when faced with the prospect of an unwinnable battle - and when the dust settles, everyone will know exactly how Scorza deals with upstarts and rabble rousers."
ita_spirit_of_fiume:0 "피우메 정신"
ita_spirit_of_fiume_desc:0 "Even before the March of Rome and the founding of the PNF, an event which involved numerous soon to be fascists took place, in what was then a territory outside of Italy. The glorious saga of Fiume, where poet-warrior Gabriele D'Annunzio set up his state after taking the city by storm, with the eventual goal of integrating the city into Italy. The Carnaro Regency, D'Annunzio's state, was a masterwork of political engineering, and its constitution, the Charter of Carnaro, was the most forward-thinking and advanced set of laws that a nation could hope for at the time. Fiume is to us as a shining beacon, an example to follow, and we are the only ones who can realize D'Annunzio's ideals in the modern times."
ita_doctorine_of_fascism_2019:0 "파시즘의 원칙"
ita_doctorine_of_fascism_2019_desc:0 "According to Giovanni Gentile, the fascist ideology differs from all other political orientations because it is by far the most adaptive, and it changes with the times. Fascism lives to the beat of history, and for this reason it is foolish to believe that we can try to suddenly shape the culture, tradition, and spirit of the Italian nation to follow an ideological project. At the same time, we must recognize that the rise of fascism was fundamental to save Italy from the threat of communism which was emerging at the time, and also brought it to newfound greatness over the decades. Fascism is a historical project that, like any project, changes with the times, and we too shall make our changes, but without disrespecting our past."
ita_loyalty_to_the_duce:0 "두체에게 충성"
ita_loyalty_to_the_duce_desc:0 "Fascism as an ideology is defined by a single factor - fanatical loyalty to the leader. All the rest is secondary, as fascism cannot be separated from the figure of the Duce, who should at all times occupy the minds and hearts of any fascist worthy of this adjective. Contradicting the Duce is equal to treason - disobeying the Duce is identical to high treason. All those in Verona will be reminded of these truths, so that they do not get the idea that just as Scorza was put in place after his predecessor was ousted, that means that the same can happen to the current Duce. Obedience, devotion, and loyalty - anyone who does not possess these three qualities is an enemy of the State and of the Duce."
ita_send_the_carabinieri:0 "카라비니에리 파견"
ita_send_the_carabinieri_desc:0 "While the situation in Verona seems to have at least partially defused, some of the more violent and rowdy protestors are still a source of worry. For this reason, Scorza has ordered the Carabinieri to move into Verona and make sure that the ruckus is kept to a minimum - they have orders to arrest the troublemakers, make sure nobody gets too hurt, and use tear gas and fire hydrants to disperse riots and large crowds, only using live ammunition if strictly necessary. Hopefully, and with a bit of luck, the worst is over, and the situation will be under complete control soon."
ita_send_in_the_blackshirts_2019:0 "검은 셔츠단 파견"
ita_send_in_the_blackshirts_2019_desc:0 "The Duce, in his wisdom, has decided that the best way to deal with the situation in Verona is to unleash the MVSN, the most well known fascist paramilitary, also known as Blackshirts. Their orders are to restore public order in Verona and make sure any act of insubordination is dealt with, without hesitating to use violence if the situation calls for it. The Blackshirts are notoriously somewhat rowdy, and it's likely that there will be at least some small scale urban warfare, but sending in the MVSN is first and foremost equal to broadcasting a political message - that the people in Verona are betraying the fascist cause, and the most appropriate way to remind them of that is sending the fascist militia after them."
ita_send_in_the_big_ol_army:0 "군대를 보내라"
ita_send_in_the_big_ol_army_desc:0 "Carlo Scorza has ordered that the time has come to make an example out of the would be subversives currently squatting in Verona. Generals of the Regio Esercito were given orders to enter Verona in full force (including tanks and helicopters), remove all threats to public order, and not hesitate to use lethal violence whenever they feel it is necessary. Urban warfare will be almost inevitable, as will be collateral damage to civilians and property, but this is exactly the kind of message the Duce has decided to send the nation. By giving the people of the Congress a thorough thrashing, Scorza will make sure that anyone will think twice before ever challenging his rule again."
ita_eia_eia_alala:0 "Eia Eia Alalà!"
ita_eia_eia_alala_desc:0 "As the crowds of fascist supporters cheer their Duce in Verona, it seems that ghosts of the past have returned, wandering in the wind. Their names are spoken in admiration by the people, names that had started to fade away in history - Filippo Corridoni, the revolutionary, Gabriele D'Annunzio, the warrior poet, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, the futurist, and many more of the earliest fascists whose vision was essential in shaping the movement. Once again, their voices are heard, and once again, a new generation of fascists seems to be ready to carry on their legacy, with Scorza at the helm - only time will tell if they will manage to live up to this promise."

ita_viva_il_duce_scorza_desc:0 "As the crowds of fascist supporters cheer their Duce in Verona, only one voice towers above all those in the squares and streets of the city, booming in the ears of the whole nation. The voice of Carlo Scorza, the new Duce of Italy, who has now made it clear that he does not intend to follow the path of his predecessor, and who has already shown that his hold on the PNF is indeed solid. The liberals and reformists within the party have been swayed to his side or turned to silence, and from a high balcony in Verona, the new Duce is announcing to Italy and to the world that his reign has begun, and will not end anytime soon."

Without much ado, and with only small scale violence, the people at the Congress have either been arrested or left the premises; the PNF representatives who were behind the whole organization have either been silenced or convinced to never challenging the Duce again; and above it all stands the new Duce.

The consequences of defying the Duce are shown for all to see in Verona - with most of those who were present at the Congress now filling the city's morgues, hospitals and prisons. The PNF representatives at the Congress are already starting to be trialed and purged one by one for treason, and it seems that from now on Scorza will have an almost total control over his party."

However, this didn't stop Italian women in the fascist camp, especially among the youth, from demanding more rights and equality - they hope that Scorza's seizure of power might bring about change to the female condition in Italy, but many voices within the party, especially in the conservative and traditionalist wings of the PNF, have expressed worry at these sentiments."

When it comes right down to it, they do not make the rules.\n\nWhat we need to do is figure out where exactly the snags and bottlenecks in our bureaucracy are, and attack them. As our regime is still new and strongly entrenched, we can expect little pushback from the bureaucrats themselves if we were to remove or redefine some regulations to allow for some flexibility.

This is what a democracy is in practice.\n\nThis is not to say we are embracing liberal ideas or abandoning the party's primacy as the primary vehicle of the nation's will.

This will allow us to reap the benefits that would normally only be available to a free market system while keeping it on a tight enough leash that we are capable of keeping it firmly under our control.

How they operate is only relevant to us, naturally, to the extent that bribes and contracts will have to penetrate this shadowy system to have a chance at success. It is fortunate indeed that a number of Italian citizens are doing business in the US. By drawing on their know-how and political contacts, working with the leadership of ‘the free world’ is as simple as knowing who to talk to.\n\nLet the Americans know we accept dollars, and don’t much care where they come from."

At the time when such regulation was created, the Duce and his advisors were rightly concerned with maintaining an iron grip over the economy so it could serve the national interest. Yet times have changed, and so have the demands placed on us in order to achieve our goals. In keeping with these changed circumstances, we will remove much of the regulation placed on trade and financial transactions in the Italian sphere.\n\nThe new order of things will pay off quickly. Drawing on the talents of our more liberal-minded economists, we will identify precisely which regulations are holding back business and slash them, without any hesitation. The resulting scramble of economic activity will create growth and diversification, bringing a flood of money into the Treasury. Surely we can always reverse the tide if things go a little too quickly for our liking?"

We will neither weaken the state’s ability to intervene in economic matters, nor will we excise it from the economy almost entirely. Instead we will walk the middle path, and the results of this approach will prove us right.\n\nA guiding principle of the middle road has been aptly summarised by one of our economic experts as ‘money where it matters’. By privatising non-essential sectors of the economy which are currently under the state’s command, but leaving aside many areas which could be of strategic interest, we will make the money we need without throwing aside our mastery of the Italian economy. In this manner no aspect of our development will be neglected, and the money freed up will be able to go where it is truly needed."

Now, however, we face new challenges. We need money, and in divesting ourselves of a large chunk of the public sector, we will acquire that money quickly and easily.\n\nPrivatisation is not a simple matter; there will be a large number of details to work out, and we must ensure that the Italian economy remains in the hands of Italian business. Having ensured this, we should go forward with boldness. Being dogmatic and ideological will only harm us in the long run, and in being willing to part with sentimentality now, we will avoid a great deal of trouble in the long run. This is far from a rash decision. The unwieldiness of the public sector, the burden of paying far too many civil servants to administer it, and the lethargy generated by this is clear to see. We must be decisive. Italians will thank us for our foresight in decades to come."

Military, economic and diplomatic - all areas of the greatest importance, and all of which will be strengthened by this move. By reinvesting in the military, we shall make our army once more among the finest in the world, drawing the attention of the other global powers.

If an Italian firm wishes to sell back to the homeland, it should not have to deal with petty concerns like ‘export restrictions’ or ‘national sovereignty’. If it wishes to employ people past working hours, then it should not have to meet with inspections. And if it comes face to face with unionisers, we will communicate the duty of the host government to stamp such activity out.

There are more important areas for law enforcement to focus on. As such, we shall make it known to the police that their efforts to stem contraband of all kinds are generally required elsewhere.\n\nThe new strategy of turning a blind eye will not win universal support at first, certainly among those sectors of the bureaucracy and the police which have spent careers fighting the black market. Thankfully, the situation will resolve itself. The Mafias operating in the Italosphere have long perfected the art of mutual benefit, and the positive impact of disregarding illicit trade will not just be abstract. The entrepreneurs of the grey trade will be appreciative, and when they decide to show their appreciation to the local Fascist authorities, we will develop an unofficial subsidy to the wages of our bureaucrats and police officials.

By encouraging the police to take an active interest in countering subversive activity among workers, we will nip any possibility of rebellion in the bud. Workers will understand that concerns like a 'living wage' and 'safety standards' are irrelevant to their duty. If they do not, then the police will break bones until they do.

We shall have to come to some arrangement with the Pakt, with its immense wealth of resources and markets, and the Duce has expressed his approval for the idea.\n\nNow we must only look at how to proceed. The Megakorps can be bureaucratic and skeptical of innovation, but they have proven adept at making the most of massive economic monopolies. By a number of formal and informal ouvertures to the Pakt, contacting both Reich officials and civilian businessmen, it will be relatively straightforward to identify areas where we can both benefit.

There are a great number of fascist loyalists in the Ministry for Finance, and they will not ask questions when the Duce asks them to create a fund for him. By fiddling with the state budget, overstating national expenses and sweeping some papers under the carpet, the Duce will have at his disposal a significant amount of money, belonging to him alone to share with some close friends. How these funds are used is of no importance. What matters is that if, after long days leading Italy to greatness, the Duce should wish to avail himself of life's pleasures, he shall have all the money he needs to do so. And woe to the poor accountant who sees something he shouldn't - because his silence, if not borne of his own discretion, will be achieved through other means."

In the early stages of the Italian spring, Ciano and his underlings had to proceed with the purest caution, lest they tread on the wrong toes and send their nation spiraling into chaos. Now, though, the future seems far more assured. The Fascist Party was won over at Verona, the people have chosen Ciano's vision of the future over the sad nostalgia of Scorza, the inept hallucinations of Curcio, or the madness of Farinacci.

This, for example, allowed Mussolini to simply change the Statute in order to legally turn Italy from a democratic state into a fascist one. However, many lawmakers and jurists in Italy have pointed out that many laws of the Statute imply that the King has large legal powers in the Italian government, and while historically the Crown has mostly stayed out of the political life (or more recently, was effectively a fancy rubber stamp for Mussolini), these parts of the Statute are a loaded gun pointed directly at our nascent democracy. A functioning democratic state simply can't run the risk of legally turning back into an authoritarian monarchy if King Umberto or one of his successors decide that they don't like the political state of our country, thus, we need to modify the Statute and add safeguards to make sure that the King of Italy can only play a ceremonial and symbolic role, without influencing the political life of our country."

We, to be frank, have no need of their services anymore, as any legitimate democracy probably doesn't spy on their civilians and make the controversial ones vanish suddenly. We shall dissolve these organizations, and have the old secret police return home. This move has garnered much controversy amongst the dwindling hardliners, who say that we will leave thousands without a job. As much as it may hurt to admit, they do have a point, and we need to give them a pension of sorts as well, so the secret police don't turn into drunkards and hooligans, as the Blackshirts did."

As Italy continues to reform into a democracy, protests have sprung up to free these political prisoners. While it is heartwarming to see that the Italian people are actually exercising their rights, it does mean that we actually have an obligation to listen to the protesters and free the prisoners. Most of them probably will be wary of getting into politics, but hopefully they will not do something stupid like join the Red Brigades or attempt to kill the entire Italian government. In fact, let us hope that instead, they will enter politics and help Italy become a truly great country!"

We first need to allow anyone, no matter their ideology, to enter the party. This will hopefully help sideline anyone who wants to maintain the PNF's dominance. At the same time, we must remove all laws giving the PNF preferential status in Italy. We've already begun this process, but it is necessary to guarantee that the PNF can become sidelined eventually, and so that we aren't left with random positions that can only be given to those of a certain party due to our negligence."

However, if we are to do this, then it will only be a matter of time before the PNF are elected and restart the whole cycle of ending democracy. The only way to make sure that Italy can actually become a functioning democracy is to totally dissolve the PNF and end its monopoly over Italian politics. A drastic move perhaps and one that will be incredibly controversial, but a necessary one so that the PNF uses their influence to win every election, making Italian democracy a joke."

For one last time, Ciano took the floor, addressing all three in three separate meetings. All the rooms were packed, the seats were filled and journalists swarmed around the elegant Roman palaces where the fascist regime was officially about to end its own existence. Ciano delivered a very similar speech, all three times, he fondly remembered the days of Mussolini, spent a few somber words to remember the tragedies of the last World War, then spoke fiercely about his own role as Italy's Duce. He openly admitted that much of what he did was controversial, an abrupt change from the glorious recent past of Italy, tension was clearly hanging in the air as he outlined the sheer change that the PNF, the government and the very country had undergone in his years as Duce. But that tension was dissolved and erupted, all three times, into thundering applause as Ciano thanked his audience, and left the floor, for the last time. And all three times, as the applause died down, a moment of silence slowly filled the air. Only time will tell what that silence will be followed by."

A veritable explosion of tiny parties were formed in the recent past, but it seems that all political forces in the country have coalesced into three major political blocks which will duke it out in the ballots. The first of them to form was the Christian Democrats (or DC), led by Amintore Fanfani, a loose coalition of moderate conservatives, catholics and liberals who stress the importance of accelerating reforms to free up Italy's economy and society, their critics have pointed out, however, that their economic plan would probably spell disaster on Italy's underclasses. To the left, we have the Democratic Front (or FD), led by well known socialist Pietro Nenni, who has managed to take the reins of the leftist movement coalescing it into a single party, the FD mostly wish to liberalize the country's society, while creating a strong welfare state to make sure that Italy's poorest are cared for. The very existence of the PSDI has outraged the more radical conservatives and ex-fascists, who claim it to be a den of communists in disguise. Finally, the party which took the longest to form, to the right stand the National Blocs (or BN), a quite heterogeneous alliance of former moderate fascists (as the PNF formally dissolved to coalesce into the BN), monarchists, and radical conservatives, all gravitating around the charismatic former PNF secretary Giorgio Almirante, who seems poised to continue Ciano's status quo of slow-burn reforms. As the electoral race picks up more and more speed, we can only hope that, whoever gets elected, the formation of the next government will be a smooth and orderly process, without the ugly face of violent radicalism appearing again."

demitaly.9.t:0 "Ciano Speaks to the Gran Consiglio"
demitaly.9.d:0 "Today Ciano has taken the floor in Palazzo Venezia to address the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo, in a speech that was strictly kept secret from national media. As spoke, Ciano criticized Mussolini's tenure as Duce, underlining key aspects which "undermined the Italian state"; Ciano moved on to criticize several aspects of the current fascist state, and the necessity of them being immediately changed.\n\nThe Duce mentioned the cult of personality around his figure and that of his predecessors, the excessively authoritarian and repressive measures taken by fascism against political opponents, the lack of transparency and accountability in many fascist institutions, and the forced italianization of linguistic and cultural minorities. All these factors, according to Ciano, have "kept Italy from achieving its full potential as a free nation", and "must be addressed if we wish our nation to prosper into the future".\n\nThe speech was partially leaked to the press, and caused much discussion among both supporters and opposers of Ciano. At this point, the writing is clearly on the wall, and it is apparent that the Duce wants to at least partially dismantle the system that he's the leader of. International observers agree that this might be the beginning of the end for the fascist state, possibly leading to the dawn of a new, democratic era."

demitaly.11.d:0 "In a speech broadcasted through national radio, His Majesty King Umberto II di Savoia, King of Italy, Emperor of Ethiopia, First Marshal of the Empire, has spoken about the recent modifications of the Albertine Statute, Italy's constitutional law. In particular, the King gracefully accepted and welcomed the new limitations imposed by law on his person, and swore to comply with them in order to "follow the will of the Italian nation, which I serve".\n\nIn particular, the recent modifications, imposed by Ciano and agreed upon by King Umberto, remove the king's power to appoint ministers, to dissolve Parliament, and make it impossible for His Majesty to veto laws in Parliament. From now on, unless these new laws are changed again by Parliament, the King will effectively lose all political power in Italy, and continue existing as a mere figurehead.\n\nIt was already well known that Umberto II wasn't very engaged with the political matters of the Kingdom, and that he enjoyed mutual trust and friendship with Ciano; however, few would have speculated that the King would willingly renounce all political power for him and his descendants. Strangely, this news has been welcomed by both the left and the right wing, as many fascists still hold true to the original republican ideals of the PNF."

demitaly.12.d:0 "Today, Ciano has passed what might be his most controversial law, the one that would dissolve the Gran Consiglio del Fascismo, the most important executive body of the fascist regime. The Grand Council of Fascism won't be the only organism that will be dissolved, but with it the various fascist unions and syndicates, the MVSN, and several others, will be eliminated.\n\nThis is so far the most serious and decisive blow that Ciano has dealt to the fascist power structure, effectively striking at the heart of the fascist regime in the name of a renewed democracy. Of course, many conservative and pro-fascist representatives voiced harsh dissent, but the news were welcomed by large strata of Italian society which are largely in favor of Ciano's reforms.\n\nThe Grand Council will be replaced by a cabinet of ministers, appointed by a Prime Minister who will be in turn elected by Parliament. This is the first serious step towards the creation of a new democratic order in Italy, and the media speculate that it is only a matter of time before elections and full democratization come to the country."

demitaly.13.t:0 "Ciano Announces a Democratic Camera"
demitaly.13.d:0 "The Italian lower house, since 1939, has been represented by the Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni, a non-elected assembly made up of important representatives of the regime, in theory it was supposed to be the main organ of the fascist political edifice, but in practice it was filled by yesmen who did nothing more than put a rubber stamp on Mussolini's orders. Ciano has demanded the dissolution of the Camera dei Fasci e delle Corporazioni, which will be replaced by a democratically elected Camera dei Deputati.\n\nThe new Camera will also function in tandem with the Senate in a regime of perfect bicameralism, this reforms was put in place by Ciano to ensure that in order to change laws any party must hold a majority in both the upper and the lower chamber of Parliament. It is clear that Ciano's goal isn't simply to dismantle fascism, but also to make sure that it doesn't come back any time soon.\n\nAs another key element of the fascist regime disappears from Italy, to be replaced by a democratic legislative body, some are already starting to get ready for the new elections. Many are still skeptical about Ciano's democratization of the country, but there's no denying that the Duce wants to see it through to the end."

demitaly.14.d:0 "The Senate, one of the few pre-fascist political organisms that was left mostly untouched by Mussolini's restructuring of Italian politics, is still however packed full by senators-for-life appointed by the former Duce, remarkably, just in 1939, 212 people were made senators from a decree signed by the King, who was strong-armed by Mussolini. Ciano has ordered that all senators-for-life will lose their status after the coming elections, thus ensuring a full "reset" of the Senate.\n\nNo exceptions were made to this rule, in order to avoid adding even more controversy to a decision that is already extremely divisive, the Senate, as the upper chamber of the Italian kingdom, is the most prestigious and respected political body of the State. Ciano has however remarked multiple times that there can be no democracy if the upper chamber is still packed with non-democratically elected representatives.\n\nBy now, it is pretty certain that the date of the election will be announced soon, and several parties and political movements are already starting to form, as the different strata and groups of Italian society start to look for those who could protect their interests. International media are still amazed at Ciano's push towards democracy, the first such case in a fascist country."

However, in his wisdom, the Duce has decided that Scorza's talent was wasted in Italy, and decided to assign him to a delicate and important diplomatic position, as an ambassador to the Caribbean island nation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\n\nBehaving like a proper fascist, Scorza did not question the order coming from the Duce, and quietly accepted his duty. In his formal letter to him, Ciano urged him to show his devotion to the Italian nation and to the fascist cause by carrying out this task of the utmost geopolitical importance. Scorza will have to safeguard and uphold the Italian interests in the islands, making sure that the flame of the fascist revolution shines its light even half a world away.\n\nSince Ciano knew that Scorza would be so eager to complete this task, he didn't wait too long to send him on his way; this also meant that the few friends and associates Scorza still has in the PNF knew of his departure only when he was inside a plane above the Atlantic Ocean, but sometimes such things are inevitable. The whole nation of Italy places its hopes in Scorza, and the population will surely devote their thoughts to him and his mission."

The King has gracefully accepted to preside over the transition period, acting as the supreme executive power in Italy until the elections have taken place.\n\nThis moment marks a historic landmark for Italy, and will forever be remembered as the day when the birthplace of fascism decided to abandon that system, and return to democracy. In the shade of the great monuments of the fascist era, such as the EUR district in Rome, large crowds celebrate the beginning of a new era, which will mean freedom, prosperity and happiness for all.\n\nOptimism is universal at this point, as all major political factions think they have a good shot at winning the elections; the predictions made by media are completely inconsistent, with some polls projecting a victory for the liberals, others betting on the leftists, and a few are even adamant that it will be the neo-fascists who will secure the mandate. No one knows who will win the battle of democracy, but one thing is certain, Ciano, the Duce that ended fascism, has won his own battle."

cianopartysupport.5.d:0 "It seems that the Italian Spring has finally turned into summer: the last remains of the fascist regime have thawed, melting away to reveal a blossoming democracy. Such an optimistic prospect, however, might be a bit too naive. The electoral race will be hotly contested, and while for now the prospect of violent radicalism is unlikely to materialize, the vote will reveal large fractures within the Italian society. Three parties have entered the fight, but only one can come out on top.\n\nTo the right, we have the Blocchi Nazionali. Ostensibly a big tent right-wing coalition, the BN is in fact dominated by former members of the PNF loyal to Ciano - the press calls them "neofascists", but it's tough to understand exactly how "neo" they are. Giorgio Almirante, their leader, is undeniably gifted at politics, and has rallied the vast majority of those who, for a reason or another, wish that fascism never went away. Voting for the BN means voting for status quo, stability, and continuation of policies that have proved successful in the past. A victory for the BN is unlikely, but not impossible - sometimes, in a democracy, the underdog can win.\n\nIn the centre, the Democrazia Cristiana. A coalition of liberals, centrists, and moderates, they designed a vast program of reforms aimed at bringing Italy into the modern age. Focusing on economic development, the DC hopes to abandon the cumbersome leftovers from the fascist era, while still respecting Italy's heritage, traditions and history. The DC are split between a liberal wing and a conservative one tied to the Church, but so far divisions have been set aside in favor of cohesion, and the party rallied behind the charismatic Aldo Moro. The DC attracts votes from the economically liberal but socially conservative upper - middle classes of Italy, as well as from the more Catholic-minded strata of the population. According to media observers, a DC victory is highly likely.\n\nTo the left, last but not least, the Fronte Democratico. Their platform can be summarized in a single word: antifascism. This wider leftist front, crafted by the political skill of former exile Pietro Nenni, sees fascism as the biggest threat to the existence of democracy, and has sworn to fight with all its strength to remove the vestiges of the fascist regime and give Italy the fresh start it deserves. The FD gets its votes mostly from students, for their promises of liberalization of education and press, and from the lower classes, who have been swayed by their promises of a strong welfare state and of policies meant to look after all Italians. It's difficult to estimate how likely a victory for the FD is, but it is certainly a real possibility.\n\nThe pieces have been set, and the game is in motion: the future of Italy will be shaped by these elections, more than it can be predicted now."

# NEW ITALY INTRO TREE #
########################

ita_grand_council_session:0 "Session XXXIII of the Grand Council"
ita_grand_council_session_desc:0 "In the year of our lord 1962, or the fortieth year of the Fascist Era, Italy stands as one of the world's largest empires and among the ranks of the world's great powers. The political situation in the country is fragmented however, with the ruling PNF, or Partito Nazionale Fascista, divided between the conservative and radical faction led by its secretary, Carlo Scorza, and a more progressive faction tied to the current Duce, Galeazzo Ciano. The Grand Council of Fascism, Italy's supreme executive body, has been called to decide on several issues currently plaguing the nation and its empire, in what is seemingly a routine session - however, what is decided here might have far reaching effects for Italy's future."

ita_forza:0 "힘"
ita_forza_desc:0 "The primacy of Italy over its empire and its allies must not be ensured through naked coercion and sabre rattling. Instead, Italy must act as a beacon of stability, prosperity and peace in the Mediterranean and in Europe. We must act to better integrate the various nations under our protective wing into a unified economic and political structure. This is the official party line endorsed by Galeazzo Ciano, the current Duce, and while it might have prevailed at this session, it's hard to tell how well this will translate into practice."

ita_prepare_constitutional_comitee:0 "Prepare A Special Committee"
ita_prepare_constitutional_comitee_desc:0 "Around the person of Galeazzo Ciano, a small number of prominent party members and high ranking officials has gathered, functioning as an unofficial council of advisors to the Duce, including party politicians like Dino Grandi and generals such as Giovanni de Lorenzo. Solidifying and cementing this small clique as the Duce's inner circle will be vital to carry out Ciano's plans, as fierce opposition from within the ranks of the PNF might at any moment bring the Duce's reforms to a crashing halt. "

ita_speak_in_parliament:0 "Speak To The Council"
ita_speak_in_parliament_desc:0 "Among the ranks of the Grand Council, one can find an image of the varied and often contradictory components and interest groups that make up the fascist states. Blackshirt generals, fascist trade unionists, old time politicians, jurists, bureaucrats, scholars and many more. This somewhat colorful ensemble of characters, uniforms, medals and suits must be reigned in and convinced that the Duce is working for them all. Pleasing everyone is impossible, but there are surely many among the Council that could be swayed to Ciano's side, therefore strengthening his ranks and politically isolating Scorza."

ita_sicurezza:0 "안정"
ita_sicurezza_desc:0 "Our brave soldiers have won Italy the empire she deserved, our place in the sun. But maintaining an empire under control isn't easy - all over, subversives, terrorists and insurgents threaten the peace that we have established in the Mediterranean. We must act to ensure that nobody can dare to threaten our hold of the Mare Nostrum, unless we wish to see the empire that we endured so many hardships to build fall into anarchy. This is the line espoused by Carlo Scorza, secretary of the PNF, and which the current Duce was strong-armed into adopting to avoid risking a rebellion from within his own party. It's hard to say how much this new policy will affect reality, but observers from the nations in the Italian sphere don't seem too pleased."

ita_reforms_can_wait_for_now:0 "Reforms Can Wait"
ita_reforms_can_wait_for_now_desc:0 "With the situation in the country still threatened by subversive elements and the various puppet states and colonies that make up our empire still wildly unstable, this doesn't exactly seem like the best possible time for reforms and liberalization. Maintaining an empire is not an easy task, and thus we must utilize all the proper tools for the jobs - after all, the censorship laws, the OVRA, and the Special Tribunals for enemies of the state were created for a reason."

ita_reinforce_garrisons:0 "수비대 강화"
ita_reinforce_garrisons_desc:0 "Currently, the Regio Esercito, the Regia Marina and the other branches of our mighty armed forces are scattered across our empire, either ensuring the peace and security of our domains or propping up and supporting the militaries of our allies and vassal states. However, from all the corners of the Mare Nostrum, our brave men in uniform cry out that they need more men and resources to carry out their duties. Therefore, we must reinforce and strengthen our garrisons and armies across the whole Mediterranean, in order to make sure that nobody can threaten the Pax Romana."

ita_remind_the_king:0 "왕을 기억하라" ##Verona Conference Reminder##
ita_remind_the_king_desc:0 "His Imperial and Royal Majesty Umberto II, by the Grace of God and the Will of the Nation King of Italy and Albania, Emperor of Ethiopia, First Marshal of the Empire, is a man with numerous grandiose titles, but little real weight in politics. Italian kings have rarely directly meddled with their kingdom's political troubles, and Umberto II is no exception, instead preferring to act as a symbolic figurehead. However, with the Verona Congress now appearing on the horizon, it would be wise to involve the King in drawing up emergency and fallback plans in case something in Verona goes horribly wrong. We expect the Congress to proceed in an orderly and calm fashion, but perhaps one can never be too cautious."

ita_road_to_freedom:0 "자유의 길"
ita_road_to_freedom_desc:0 "The numerous restrictions and oppressive measures that we have placed upon our numerous subjects in the empire were borne out of emergency. Now that our hold over the Mediterranean is firm, we can start moving towards granting greater autonomy and freedom to our vassals in the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa - we will still maintain our sphere of influence, but without the need for violence or threats. Italy shall be the first among equals in a community of nations, all sharing the common goal of building peace in Europe and protection against the brutality of the German boot."

ita_road_to_order:0 "질서의 길"
ita_road_to_order_desc:0 "Italy has managed to succeed where most others, in history, have failed - creating a lasting peace in the Mediterranean and in the Middle East. Such a peace could only be achieved through might - the might of our armed forces. If we renounce our role as peacekeepers and guardians of order in our empire, we will undo all our past efforts, and thus we must reinforce our hold over the far reaches of our empire, from Algeria to Oman, in order to ensure that the Roman dream of Mussolini and of fascism doesn't disappear like sand in the wind."

ita_40_years_of_fascism:0 "파시즘 40주년"
ita_40_years_of_fascism_desc:0 "In forty years, Italy has gone far. From a nation threatened by poverty and bolshevism, to a glorious victory in a world war - from a weak nation almost destroyed by the First World War into one of the globe's major powers. For better or worse, fascism transformed our nation, turning it into what it is now - the names of Mussolini and the other great men of the regime will forever be consigned to history books as the creators and leaders of this brave new era. However, fascism's legacy is complex, and while some feel that the conquests of the fascist revolution have not gone far enough in creating a new order, many more believe that the fascist era has entered its final years. None can tell if this fortieth anniversary of the March on Rome marks the beginning of the end, or simply the end of the beginning."

ita_prepare_for_malta_conference_newintro:0 "몰타 회담 준비"
ita_prepare_for_malta_conference_newintro_desc:0 "The Mediterranean is Our Sea, Mare Nostrum. At least that's what fascist propaganda tells people - as always, reality is a bit more complex than that. Our relationship with other major nations in the area has been regulated by the accords and treaties set up together with the so called Triumvirate, an alliance reuniting the three major nations of the region, Italy, Iberia, and Turkey. However, increasing issues over different spheres of influence, in Algeria, the Middle East, and other such problems are threatening the stability of this alliance. A conference in Malta, the centre of the Mediterranean Sea, will surely help reinforce the bonds between us and our loyal allies."

ita_send_out_the_invites_newintro:0 "초대장 발송"
ita_send_out_the_invites_newintro_desc:0 "La Valletta, reclaimed in World War Two from the British who were squatting there since Napoleon's times and finally reunited with Italy, has never looked as beautiful as it does now. The flags of Italy, Iberia, Turkey and the smaller nations of the Triumvirate wave in the wind, and the hot Mediterranean sun kisses the rooftops and bell towers of the city as ships come and go from its harbor. The only thing left to do now is to send out the formal invitations to the politicians, diplomats and dignitaries that will arrive from all over the Mediterranean to convene in Malta, where hopefully a future of peace and shared prosperity for all of our nations can be built."

ita_am_icizia:0 "제국"
ita_am_icizia_desc:0 "Italy currently boasts the world's fourth economy and its vast empire and sphere of influence span over three continents. A focus on proper foreign policy, which in the past has been neglected in favor of the pursuit of autarky, is now necessary to mend the various issues that plague the empire and its subjects. Deals with foreign powers, reworked relationships with vassal states and increased integration into the empire are just some of the problems that have to be addressed to achieve the prosperity we deserve."

ita_empire_renewal:0 "제국의 부활"
ita_empire_renewal_desc:0 "Our empire is currently a patchwork of directly governed territories (such as Montenegro and Albania), military governates (such as the Levant), puppet states (such as Croatia and Egypt), allies and friendly regimes (such as the Arabian monarchies) and even a viceroyalty, Italian East Africa. Therefore, it should be no surprise that such a vast empire is somewhat disjointed - however, we should focus on improving economic and political integration between the various territories under our control. Building more infrastructure, encouraging political reforms and investing into the more underdeveloped parts of the empire are just some of the things we can do to move closer to achieving a status truly worthy of the name Pax Romana."

ita_citizens_in_NAF:0 "리비아 군정의 종결"
ita_citizens_in_NAF_desc:0 "The territories of Libya have been annexed to the metropolitan kingdom of Italy in 1934 under the leadership of governor Italo Balbo. Since then, the indigenous Arabs who inhabit Libya have been granted the status of 'Italian Libyan citizens', which gives them a legal status identical to the Italians - however, this legal status is only valid as long as they reside in Libya, and outside of it they are simply colonial subjects of the Crown. The Muslim population of Libya has proved time and time again their loyalty to us, and we believe it's time to remove these restrictions and grant the Libyan Arabs the full status of Italian citizen."

ita_balkan_reform:0 "발칸 계획"
ita_balkan_reform_desc:0 "Our hold on the Balkans is currently dependent on three things: first the several regions under our direct control, such as Montenegro, Albania and Dalmazia, which in many cases are inhabited by non-Italian populations who have expressed discontent at our rule. Secondly, the Kingdom of Croatia, a nominally independent nation and factually puppet state, dealing with partisan insurgency and Ustaše terrorism. Thirdly, Greece, a state barely holding itself together under the pressure of several well armed and trained insurgent groups. The situation isn't exactly looking rosy, so addressing our Balkan woes is in order if we don't want that damn peninsula turning into the spark that ignites yet another crisis."

ita_algerian_summit:0 "알제리 회담"
ita_algerian_summit_desc:0 "The situation in Algeria is, to put it simply, a complete mess. Pied-noir militias, native insurgent groups, and settler defense groups all fight over territory and oil producing regions, all while the whole country is nominally still part in the French State. In the recent years, Algeria became the theatre of low intensity warfare between these different groups, and the steady advance of Iberian soldiers and settlers into the territory is rapidly becoming a source of concern among both the Italian settlers and our military. We must immediately call a summit with Iberia to resolve the situation before it escalates."

ita_deustasization:0 "우스타샤 분쇄"
ita_deustasization_desc:0 "After Yugoslavia was invaded by Axis forces in WW2, the Independent State of Croatia was established as a kingdom in the Italian sphere of influence, with Aimone di Savoia-Aosta ruling as King Tomislav II. However, real power in the country was in the hands of the Ustaše, a fascist and ultranationalist party and paramilitary known for its brutality against Serbs and other ethno-religious minorities. The leader of the Ustaše, Ante Pavelić, died in 1959, and this gave us the opportunity to intervene more directly in Croatia and sidelining the Ustaše more and more, to the point that they have turned against us and are now waging a guerrilla war against the Kingdom. We must quickly move more resources and men to Croatia to crush the Ustaše and its fanatical followers before they become too powerful!"

ita_slave_rights_gaming:0 "피난민들의 권리"
ita_slave_rights_gaming_desc:0 "After the end of World War II, Italy and her former German friend have started to drift apart more and more, as allies rapidly turned into bitter rivals. In the chaos that followed the economic crash of the '50s, a wave of refugees coming from Germany, largely Jews and members of other ethnic minorities, made their way to Italy to escape Nazi oppression. Many of them were resettled in the new Adriatic lands reclaimed by Atlantropa, and have lived there since then. While these communities have integrated rather well into Italian society, they still lack numerous basic rights granted to Italian citizens. We should move towards granting equality and rights to these men and women, so that they too can become children of Rome."

ita_croatia_on_the_road:0 "크로아티아의 중심"
ita_croatia_on_the_road_desc:0 "Croatia is quickly revealing itself to be the weak spot in our empire, with the Ustaše becoming an ever greater threat and the ZAVNOH partisans getting stronger with every passing day. The situation might quickly slip out of control if we don't immediately intervene. The autonomy and independence granted to the Croatian government will be further reduced, declaring a state of national emergency and giving supreme power to the cadre of Italian generals and advisors surrounding King Tomislav. An empire is not too different from a chain, and Croatia is its weakest link - we cannot allow it to break."

ita_potential_in_india:0 "인도의 잠재력"
ita_potential_in_india_desc:0 "Since the Nineteenth Century our foreign and colonial policy has always had an eastern direction, with our two earliest colonies, Somalia and Eritrea, located on the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea respectively. Therefore, it is only natural that we seek closer trade deals and relationships with India, as this won't only allow us to find new profitable markets to sell our products to, but also reinforce our geopolitical presence in the Indian Ocean. "

ita_democracy_can_work_2019:0 "Democracy Can Work?"
ita_democracy_can_work_2019_desc:0 "Despite only having recently gained its independence from the British oppressors, India appears to be a relatively stable and rapidly growing state. Some in Italy say that this happened in spite of its democratic and popular government, but many are starting to think that India's newfound prosperity and stability is actually the result of a well managed democracy. As goods and people pass through our Indian Ocean ports in ever greater quantities, ideas are starting to pass through as well, and having a friendly, powerful democratic ally will surely do no good for the fascist cause in Italy."

ita_open_up_the_indian_ocean:0 "인도양 개방"
ita_open_up_the_indian_ocean_desc:0 "Many of the archaic and protectionist restrictions put in place in foreign trade before WW2 are still present, and are a hindrance to profit and commerce in the Indian Ocean. By creating new bureaucratic and legal frameworks to allow freer commerce and movement of goods and people in the Indian Ocean, as well as further investing into infrastructure, we can turn our eastern ports (such as Mogadiscio, Dubai and Assab) into international maritime trade hubs that will make our vast empire even more profitable."

ita_libertarian_japan:0 "일본과의 협력"
ita_libertarian_japan_desc:0 "While the old Axis alliance is no more and our relationship with Germany has gone down the drain since World War Two, we have always been much friendlier with Japan. As natural trade partners in the Indian Ocean, Italy and Japan have always enjoyed good relationships and good trade, but there's certainly more we can do to bring our two great countries even closer."

ita_italo_japan_gaming:0 "이탈리아-일본 협력"
ita_italo_japan_gaming_desc:0 "The economies of Japan and Italy are extremely compatible with one another, as the Italians can offer them massive amounts of oil in exchange for Japanese manufactured goods and raw materials from Sphere nations. By signing closer trade deals, we can increase the volume of goods moved between our respective sides of the Indian Ocean, therefore increasing our profit margins and the amount of money we'll be able to invest in our empire. More trade is always good for us, and we have more than enough oil to spare."

ita_unlikely_friends_japan:0 "예상 밖의 친구"
ita_unlikely_friends_japan_desc:0 "As a result of the renewed Italian-Japanese partnership, Japanese prime minister Hiroya Ino has been invited on an official state visit to Rome. Galeazzo Ciano is quite the charmer, and he's already preparing to make sure that the visit goes as smoothly as it could - the most refined entertaining, the most exquisite food, the most sublime music, the most elegant dresses and a glass of our best wine to accompany it all. Considering that the Duce is a famously well spoken and cultured man, so it wouldn't be surprising if a genuine friendship blossoms between Ciano and his Japanese counterparts."

ita_common_interests:0 "공통의 관심사"
ita_common_interests_desc:0 "The Regia Marina and the Imperial Japanese Navy are two of the most fearsome fleets that now sail the world's wide oceans, and their respective spheres of influence encompass opposite sides of the Indian Ocean. By working together, these mighty navies can ensure peace and order in the Indian Ocean by stamping out piracy and policing the high seas. As a sign of friendship, the Regia Marina and the IJN will conduct joint military exercises and drills: not only this will strike fear in the heart of our rivals, but it will also give us important insight on how the world's foremost naval superpower manages its navy. "

ita_nyaaa_tokyo_nyaa:0 "도쿄로의 대표단 파견"
ita_nyaaa_tokyo_nyaa_desc:0 "With our newfound partnership with Japan, our diplomats there, spearheaded by industrialist and ambassador Ettore Conti, have proposed the creation of a permanent Italian Economic Delegation in Tokyo. This delegation will be led by a board of Italian business and finance representatives that will act as our beach head into Japanese commerce and finance, keeping ties with representatives of the Japanese government and of the various Zaibatsus, allowing us to tie our economy even closer to that of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Tokyo and Rome are on opposite sides of the globe, but they've never been so close."

itaintro.1.t:0 "The Duce's Congress"
itaintro.1.d:0 "Session XXXIII of the Grand Council of Fascism has started at Palazzo della Farnesina in Rome, as journalists and policemen swarmed around politicians and ministers entering the austere, rationalist building. With delegates and representatives from all the upper echelons of the fascist government gathered in the Eternal City, the Duce took the floor to address the numerous problems faced by Italy and its empire. Despite being the world's fourth superpower, Italy is still plagued by a myriad of issues both domestic and foreign, including growing dissatisfaction towards the fascist regime and rising dissent in the colonies and puppets making up Italy's empire.\n\nCiano's speech was met with thunderous applause from the Grand Council, but one part of the delegates were much colder than others. Particularly, the current secretary of the PNF Carlo Scorza and the politicians closest to him within the party are known for their opposition to the Duce, and rumors seem to imply that tensions inside the PNF are growing by the day."
itaintro.1.a:0 "Hopefully Ciano can keep everything under control..."

itaintro.2.t:0 "The Secret Committee"
itaintro.2.d:0 "Despite its facade of order and efficiency, it is well known that Roman politics are a den of snakes, and while it appears that Ciano is firmly at the helm of his nation and his party, in reality internal opposition is growing stronger and stronger. In a secret meeting at Palazzo Venezia, a small number of high ranking members of the PNF as well as some generals from the armed forces have gathered in Palazzo Venezia to speak with the Duce regarding the situation.\n\nIncluding party politicians like Dino Grandi, generals like Giovanni de Lorenzo and diplomats like Edgardo Sogno, this newly formed 'Secret Committee' will function as the Duce's inner circle to oppose the clique of party politicians gravitating around Carlo Scorza."
itaintro.2.a:0 "Keep your friends close..."

itaintro.3.t:0 "Ciano Speaks In The Council"
itaintro.3.d:0 "Ciano has once again taken the floor before the Gran Consiglio, this time directly attacking factionalism and divisions inside the PNF. While never mentioned explicitly, it is rather clear that this address was aimed at Carlo Scorza and his ever growing faction of opposers to the Duce - immediately, the situation became somewhat tense, as Scorza and his men were visibly distressed.\n\nMany observers, both international and Italian, have started to speculate that the Verona Congress, meant to happen in the near future, will be more than just a regular general congress of the PNF, but actually the occasion when the two factions that are starting to form in the party will finally clash. "
itaintro.3.a:0 "...and your enemies closer."

itaintro.4.t:0 "The Secretary's Congress"
itaintro.4.d:0 ""Session XXXIII of the Grand Council of Fascism has started at Palazzo della Farnesina in Rome, as journalists and policemen swarmed around politicians and ministers entering the austere, rationalist building. In a political power move that left many shocked, it seems that the secretary of the PNF, Carlo Scorza, has strong armed Ciano to let him speak before the congress almost as much as the Duce himself - after a short introductory address by Ciano, it was Carlo Scorza who took the floor.\n\nSuch a development is quite telling of the influence and power that Scorza has reached within the fascist government. There are many rumors circulating about Scorza's true aims and goals, but the only thing that is certain is that now someone is directly threatening Ciano's hold over the PNF."
itaintro.4.a:0 "A lowly secretary upstanding the Duce? Preposterous!"

itaintro.5.t:0 "Tension in the Council"
itaintro.5.d:0 "The contradictions between different party lines in the PNF have become immensely apparent today, as Ciano's attempts to introduce reformist plans have bogged down, faced by fierce opposition from Scorza and his faction. Rapidly, the situation devolved into bickering and arguing in circles, and after sunset everyone left the Palazzo della Farnesina dissatisfaction and anger were visible in every politicians' face.\n\nThe situation seems to become more worrying by the day, as Ciano's position is becoming increasingly precarious. Scorza has been seen talking with numerous important gerarchi, as his political manoeuvring is becoming more and more blatant. International observers are starting to become concerned that the political situation in Italy might take a sudden shift in the near future."
itaintro.5.a:0 "I don't like where this is going..."

itaintro.6.t:0 "The Garrisons In Greece"
itaintro.6.d:0 "Carlo Scorza has managed to score yet another victory in the Council, by managing to strong arm the Duce into sending out more garrisons to the puppet states of the Empire. In particular, Greece is a constant source of concern, as several partisan and insurgent groups still control large parts of the mountainous interior of the country.\n\nA proper anti-partisan campaign to get rid of the rebels would be too costly and difficult to carry out, but we can strengthen our hold of the major cities, like Athens and Thessaloniki, by sending more men and resources there. Already Italian troops and armored vehicles are embarking for Greece, and the garrisons already there have received orders to bolster their defensive positions. Gotzamanis's government might be shaky, but with our troops acting as a stabilizing force everything should go smoothly "

itaintro.26.t:0 "Ciano Meets With Umberto II" ##VERONA CONFERENCE TALK##
itaintro.26.d:0 "Today, His Excellency the Duce and Prime Minister of Italy Galeazzo Ciano has met with His Royal Highness King Umberto II in the latter's Roman residence, the Palazzo del Quirinale. The talks between the two have been largely kept secret from the media, but many speculate that Ciano is trying to seek the king's support in his political schemes - what's particularly attractive for the media is the upcoming Verona Congress, scheduled to take place a few months from now. The two are natural political allies, as many of the hardline fascists opposed to Ciano's reforms also call for the abolition of the monarchy.\n\nThe first national congress of the PNF during Ciano's reign as Duce, the Congress will take place in the Venetian city famed as the setting of Romeo and Juliet. Like in the Shakespearean tragedy, Verona will be the battlefield of two angry opposing factions - with Carlo Scorza growing ever more powerful and respected in Italy's political apparatus, and the loyalty of the army and Blackshirts uncertain. It can only be hoped that the senseless tragedy portended by the play will not come to pass.\n\nKing Umberto is well known for his shyness regarding politics, so it's hard to predict what actions will he take, if any at all. However, with a political storm likely approaching on the horizon, many look towards the Crown as a stabilizing factor - one which the nation hopefully won't need. At a time when many had written off the whims and wants of Monarchs as relics of a long forgotten age, it seems that royalty still has a little kick left in it."
itaintro.26.a:0 "Long live the King!"

itaintro.7.t:0 "Ciano Argues For The Liberalization of the Empire"

itaintro.7.d:0 "A victory has been scored by the Duce, as newspapers and media outlets enthusiastically report about Ciano's speech before the Grand Council. With fiery words, Roman reminiscences and rhetorical bombast, the Duce argued for a new policy towards the numerous Italian puppet states and allies in our sphere, from Algeria to Arabia, Epirus to Ethiopia. The grand plan includes granting more autonomy to subject states, gradually disengaging the Italian armed forces from the Empire and instead relying on native troops, and finally integrating the economies of the sphere to turn the Empire into a community in which Italy is a 'primus inter pares', in true Roman fashion.\n\nThe Council's reaction was..mixed. Split between thunderous applause and barely concealed rumbling, as the radicals within the PNF accused Ciano of betraying the principles of autarky and corporatism from which fascism rose. Such objections however fell on deaf ears, and many within the PNF look forward to the benefits of a new imperial policy, and perhaps reap some of them for themselves. "
itaintro.7.a:0 "Everyone wins, it seems..."

itaintro.8.t:0 "Scorza Argues for the Stability of the Empire"
itaintro.8.d:0 "Ciano's sidelining within the PNF is becoming ever more apparent, as he was forced to leave the floor to Carlo Scorza once again. With austere words, strong gestures and burning eyes he delivered a speech reminiscent of those of Cato Major in ancient Rome - Italy is burdened with a historical destiny, of ruling over the Mediterranean. This Empire that embraces three continents can be ruled by one thing alone - strength. And to show strength is what we need - more soldiers, larger ships, better weapons, all are needed to keep the Empire safe.\n\nApplause and cheers followed the speech, with even Ciano finding himself forced to timidly clap. As Scorza's appeal to strength and military power has silenced Ciano's democratizing ideas, many wonder what the implications of this renewed policy of militarism will mean for Italy's numerous subjects - but the more keen eyed political observers have predicted that it's only a matter of time before Carlo Scorza, the pretender, makes his move against Mussolini's heir."
itaintro.8.a:0 "A noi!"

itaintro.9.t:0 "40 Years Later" #The March On Rome Happened#
itaintro.9.d:0 "Forty years - that is how long it takes to build an Empire. Forty years - that is how long it takes for a nation to turn from a second tier country into a global power spanning over three continents and including several nations under her protective watch. The Italian eagle has spread her wings over the Mediterranean and risen over her enemies, defeating the British lion and reclaiming its Roman heritage. Troops paraded in Rome to celebrate the start of this ascent to imperial glory, the March on Rome, taking place in 1922, exactly fourty years ago. Men of the MVSN paraded among the Fori Imperiali, painting the Roman streets black with their uniforms; tanks of the Regio Esercito rolled in the streets, demonstrations of the might of the new Legions; the Regia Marina paraded with Junio Valerio Borghese and the Xª MAS at its head, as the crowds cheered the hero of Gibraltar and Alexandria; finally the aerobatic team of the Regia Aeronautica, the Frecce Tricolori, painted the skies of Rome green, white and red as the people below looked in awe.\n\nAnd after it was all done, one by one, the families who came to see the soldiers parade all went home - the fanfare ended, the politicians left the stage, and the troops returned to the barracks, Silence returned in the skies of Rome, as the moon illuminated the now empty Fori Imperiali and the Colosseum. A display of might is always reassuring, but sometimes it hides the true reality of things. With dissent spreading among the population, violent divisions emerging in the PNF, and the colonial empire becoming more and more unstable and troubled, the future of Italy, and of all Europe, hangs in the balance.\n\nIn the middle of the night, one man is still awake in Palazzo Chigi. A pile of documents sits on the Duce's desk, reports from ever more worried colonial governors, letters from members of the PNF obliquely criticizing him, and communiques from foreign leaders slathered in empty praises and vague words. However, in the silence of the night, Ciano is reading something else - a novel, titled The Leopard, published a few years ago by a Sicilian author - and one quote strikes him particularly..."
itaintro.9.a:0 "Things change so that they can stay the same."

itaintro.10.t:0 "Dealing With The Empire" ##Run down on bad trade, bad imperial situation##
itaintro.10.d:0 "Being at the helm of an Empire is sometimes not as great is it's made out to be, something that the Italian government soon discovered not long after the end of the high that followed victory in WW2. With the Italian Empire suddenly expanding to include many more territories and protected states, numerous problems quickly arose, mostly due to unending partisan activity, resistance from subject people and a slow recovery from the devastation of the war. Atlantropa only made things worse, wrecking the economy of numerous nations and forcing Mediterranean trade to be funneled across Suez, the lifeline of the Empire.\n\nIn such a situation, even the most staunch of conservatives can see the writing on the wall and be convinced that some form of action is needed, especially to amend the poor trade situation and to strengthen the Empire in general. The Duce proposed a series of radical changes to the administrative and economic realities of our great Empire, and no doubt change shall come."
itaintro.10.a:0 "Hopefully it's change for the best?"

itaintro.11.t:0 "Imperial Renewal Policy" ##Bring in the pupperts and loosen everything up##
itaintro.11.d:0 "A new round of meetings is set to take place in the Italian capital, as representatives from the local governments of several Italian puppet states and imperial dependencies have gathered to push for new policies to be implemented across the Empire. Delegates from Egypt, led by Commissioner Italo Balbo, arrived together with generals from the governates of the Levant, followed by a small crowd of politicians and even native representatives from Italian East Africa all convened in Rome, each hoping to see reforms and changes brought about for their slice of the Empire.\n\nThe path to further cooperation and integration among the various parts of the Empire won't be an easy one, as contrasting interests and requests for more autonomy make this endeavor a political nightmare. However, important concessions have already been made by Rome, as Ciano renewed promises to increase political autonomy for states under Italian protections, and to loosen the hold that the Italian armed forces have over territories like the Levant."
itaintro.11.a:0 "Perhaps the Imperial dream isn't dead?"

itaintro.12.t:0 "The Integration of Libya"
itaintro.12.d:0 "In a historic turn of events, all the barriers left between Italians and Libyans were torn down by Ciano's signature, as a new law was approved finally granting Libyans with Italian citizenship. Ciano announced this decision by condemning 'mistakes' committed by Italy in the past regarding the Libyan population, referencing the infamous massacres committed in Cyrenaica in the 1920s, while at the same time expressing his hope that this reform is the last act of the decades long integration of Libya within Italy. With the Italian and Arab populations having lived largely in peace for about two decades now, this new law recognizes the de facto assimilation of the native Muslim population into the Italian administrative unity.\n\nPublic opinion has been mixed about this new development, but the Libyan public opinion generally approved the elimination of one last bureaucratic hurdle that kept them from being considered full Italian citizens. However, many wonder if this is truly enough to contain autonomist and independentist movements from being active in the region, or if this decision might backfire in the future."
itaintro.12.a:0 "At least, it should..."

itaintro.13.t:0 "Reeling In Croatia" ##Croatia is about to lose autonomy##
itaintro.13.d:0 "With the situation in Croatia becoming ever more worrisome, Ciano has released a press statement regarding the possibility of a 'greater involvement' of Italian forces in the region. While in the past the Italian government has always presented its puppet state, Croatia, as a successful and prosperous country, Ciano painted a grim picture of the real situation in the Kingdom, citing the recent rise in partisan activity and the ever present threat of the Ustaše.\n\nCroatia has enjoyed close ties to Italy since World War II, when an Italian king was placed on the throne of the newly created kingdom. However, it seems that soon the country might find itself occupied once again by Italian forces intervening to shore up the Kingdom against insurgent movements."
itaintro.13.a:0 "This can't end well..."

itaintro.14.t:0 "The Algerian Summit" ##Meet with Iberia, NOT IN ALGIERS, to discuss border disputes. No progress is made##
itaintro.14.d:0 "Diplomats from Iberia and Italy have met in Palermo to discuss the current situation in Algeria. Considering the extremely chaotic and complex situation that the region currently is in, the news that the summit ended without any serious accomplishment was taken with no surprise. The poorly defined and porous borders between the military administrations of the two respective countries have done very little to halt the passage of weapons, militias and smuggled goods from one side to the other, and each country was happy to blame the other for that.\n\nOther points of contention included the support and armament of Pied Noirs militias, mostly reunited under the Cité Catholique umbrella organization led by Yves Guérin-Sérac, by Iberia's military government - Iberian representatives responded by pointing out the rampant mafia activities in Italian controlled areas and the alleged support given by Italy to Algerian independence groups. Each side ended up denying the other's accusation, but it seems that what truly caused this heated climate was leaked reports from ENI, the Italian oil company, suggesting that the Algerian region may be rich in oil deposits. With all these overlapping interests and the general instability of the area, many predict that an escalation might be inevitable."
itaintro.14.a:0 "Is this yet another war on the horizon?"

itaintro.15.t:0 "Operation Trolista"
itaintro.15.d:0 "The international press is reporting that troops of the Croatian kingdom, aided by Italian advisors and reinforcements, have begun to carry out Operation Trolista, a country-wide military and police operation aimed at arresting prominent people associated with or part of the Ustaše and eliminating Ustaše holdouts in rural areas of the country. In urban areas, the operation sometime resulted in guerrilla as Ustaše supporters were informed about the operation in advanced and fought back against the soldiers who came to apprehend them, resulting in small scale urban warfare.\n\nIn rural areas, the situation was much worse: heavy fighting has been reported in mountainous regions, in which Ustaše paramilitary groups still control a few hamlets and villages, many of which were either besieges and conquered after brutal combat or simply bombed into dust by Italian artillery fire. Overall, it is difficult to gauge exactly how much Trolista has actually weakened the Ustaše - while many members of the paramilitary organization have been either arrested or killed, numerous important figures of the organization, including its de facto leader Jure Francetić, seem to have de facto vanished into thin air, escaping the grasp of Italian and Croatian forces."
itaintro.15.a:0 "Hopefully this is enough to stop those fanatics..."

itaintro.16.t:0 "The Situation Regarding German Refugees"
itaintro.16.d:0 "In the last decade, the political relationship between the former Axis powers of Europe, Germany and Italy, soured to the point of no return, and turned the two allies into bitter rivals. When the economic crisis was rocking the German sphere, Italy was also suffering, but certainly not as much as its northern neighbor - thus, the Italian boot were a natural destination for the thousands of refugees that sought escape from Nazi persecution and terror, seizing their chance to flee the grasp of Germania in the chaos of the West Russian War and the economic crash.\n\nNumerous Jews, Roma and Sinti people, and even other persecuted groups such as homosexuals fled towards Italy, hoping to find refuge in a country that, while still fascist, was much more lenient than the Reich towards discriminated groups. The then Minister of Foreign Affairs and now Duce Galeazzo Ciano was supportive of Mussolini's decision to give refuge to the escaping masses, and many of them were dispersed across the vast reaches of the Empire. However, many still live in refugee camps and temporary structures, many of them located in the reclaimed lands in the Adriatic. The Duce has signed an order allocating resources to encourage integration and an eventual path to citizenship for the German refugees, in order to turn them from a burden on the back of the state into a valuable asset for our Empire."
itaintro.16.a:0 "The Roman Empire was all about assimilation and integration, after all."

itaintro.17.t:0 "Operation Teuta" ##Croatia has lost autonomy##
itaintro.17.d:0 "At midnight of yesterday Italian troops deployed along the border with Croatia have launched Operation Teuta. Italian armored columns and troops have marched into Croatia, advancing into the Kingdom's territory to bolster the already existing garrisons in several major cities, as well as set up new bases deep in the countryside and the mountains of the country. According to the first reports, anti-partisan operations have already started, with sparse fighting in the hills of the interior. The major target of the operation however still seems to be the final eradication of the Ustaše from the country.\n\nInternational media has called Operation Teuta a second invasion of Croatia, and any pretense that the country had any sort of autonomy or sovereignty is now lost. Everyone can plainly see that the Croatian Kingdom is de facto an Italian military administration, currently struggling to contain its numerous opponents. Italian public opinion has been critical of this new development, as many fail to see the benefit of yet another campaign of repression that will surely result in numerous Italian lives being wasted."
itaintro.17.a:0 "It might be the only solution to this mess..."

itaintro.18.t:0 "Indian Trade"
itaintro.18.d:0 "After Atlantropa and the collapse of our relations with Germany, the Italian Empire was left starved for trade. While the formation of the Triumvirate has ameliorated these issues to an extent, more trade relations with other countries can't hurt our country.\n\nTo this end, our diplomats have entered talks recently with the Republic of India, a natural trade partner in the Indian Ocean, in an attempt to increase trade between our two nations. It seems that our efforts have borne fruit, as the Indian government has agreed to sign a trade agreement between our two great nations, which will surely improve our trade issues. "
itaintro.18.a:0 "Another step in the long road towards economic recovery."

itaintro.19.t:0 "The Indian System"
itaintro.19.d:0 "Italy and India have never been particularly close, an isolation re-enforced by distance and opposed politics. Still, in some ways, India is not too distant from us. They are a second-rate power, with few friends and many enemies. Despite this, we have both stood tall in a hostile world. We are not as powerful as the Reich or Japan, but we are still a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHowever, much to the chagrin of many fascists here in Italy, they are not fascist. The intellectual basis for the continuation of the fascist regime is that a relatively isolated power such as ourselves can only stay alive through a strong, ordered nation, casting away pretensions such as individualism and democracy as detrimental to the ultimate goal. India, in contrast holds free elections, lacks a corporatist economy, and is not culturally constructed around a staunch sense of nationalism.\n\nYet, somehow, they are powerful, and Nehru's government is quite stable, on par with us and on par with the world. How could this be?"
itaintro.19.a:0 "Perhaps men are not tired of liberty."

itaintro.20.t:0 "Indian Ocean Wind"
itaintro.20.d:0 "Chairman Mattei looked from the windows of ENI's headquarters building in Dubai, a modern, shiny building made of glass and steel, but still somewhat influenced by the rationalist style typical of fascist architecture. From his office, he could enjoy an eagle's view over Dubai's port, and there he saw a large ship, from which many men, not too dissimilar from ants at this distance, slowly disembarked one by one. The first ship of workers from India had arrived.\n\nDubai is a strange place: envisioned by the fascist leadership as a shining city in the desert, built as a pet project to rival Atlantropa, it rapidly became a fiefdom of ENI when staggering amounts of oil were discovered in the area. Fueled by the oil fever, Dubai kept growing, and its expanding oil and naval industries are ever thirsty for more man power. Thanks to the new trade deals between Italy and India, new and marvelous opportunities of profit will be realized in Dubai, much to the benefit of both our great nations."
itaintro.20.a:0 "Gentlemen, welcome to Dubai."

itaintro.21.t:0 "Trade Deals With Japan"
itaintro.21.d:0 "To the east, the ocean gleams, shining with opportunity. While our relationships with Germany might have gone sour, our friendship with Japan is still as strong as it was when the Tripartite Pact was first signed in 1940, despite the recent and troublesome events that shook the two great Empires. The most natural solution to reinvigorate our economy would be a renewed trade compact with Japan, allowing us to exchange oil and manufactured goods for cheap resources extracted in the Sphere, which will serve to fuel our industrial expansion.\n\nA team of diplomats, including representatives of ENI hand picked by Enrico Mattei, has started to negotiate the exact term of these accords with representatives of the Rising Sun, and it seems that an official visit by Japanese Prime Minister Ino is going to take place in Rome soon."
itaintro.21.a:0 "Trusted friends are always nice to have!"

itaintro.22.t:0 "Roman Evenings"
itaintro.22.d:0 "The Sun sets over Rome, its rays playing with the branches of the cypress trees that line the Appian Way. The cobblestone road seems to stretch eternally in the hills that surround the city, as it once did when Roman legionaries, merchants, peasants and emperors walked along it. Now the Appia Antica is much more quiet, and only two people are walking on it, talking quietly in a perfect French, the language of diplomacy. After all the fanfare, the politics, and the crowds, the Duce proposed a tranquil walk among the Roman ruins of the Appian Way to conclude the last day of Japanese Prime Minister Hiroya Ino's official state visit to the Italian capital.\n\nAs the sound of cicadas is heard faintly in the background, Ciano and Ino find themselves more and more involved in their informal conversation, which started from personal themes such as tastes in music and theatre - but rapidly took much more melancholic undertones. As the first stars begin to appear in the evening sky, two men realize more and more that perhaps, even if separated by oceans and continents, they are not much different from each other. The burden of ruling an empire on the brink of catastrophe, threatened by outside enemies and torn by internal fights, the extenuating task of being forced to commit ever more morally dubious acts of realpolitik, the ever present terror of the possibility that in the end it was all for nothing: such things cannot be easily shared. But perhaps, in that Roman sunset, as the cicadas sung, two men found some peace, even if it was just for a passing moment."
itaintro.22.a:0 "Sometimes, one needs to put things into perspective."

itaintro.23.t:0 "The Nagasaki Trade Compact"
itaintro.23.d:0 "A new commercial agreement was signed today in Nagasaki by Italian diplomats and representatives from Japan, Manchuria, China, Guangdong and several other nations in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Perhaps an event not attracting as much attention as the naval exercises or the state visits, it however far exceeds them in importance. Both nations stand to benefit from the new trade compact, as it allows freer circulation of goods and capital in the Indian Ocean, thus linking the vital resources possessed by the two empires."
itaintro.23.a:0 "Here's to profit!"

itaintro.24.t:0 "Our Success With Japan"
itaintro.24.d:0 "An Italian ship sails into the port of Tokyo. On its deck are hundreds of containers. Some carry the goods that are famously Italian - wine, motor scooters, the like. In others, machine parts and grain. Only a few hundred metres away, barrels of oil are piped out of Italian tankers. Italian oil, extracted from North Africa, now fuels the Japanese Army from Manchuria to Bengal, offsetting the need to exploit the relatively limited Sphere reserves.\n\nBut the success does not stop here.\n\nNo, it goes far further! Italian ties and suits fly off the shelf in the Mitsukoshi department stores. Italian cinema dominates Japanese theaters. An "Italy Fever" has seemed to have swept Japan. It certainly will not last, but it still proves just how quickly our new friendship has come together. Still, the most important effect of our new success is the cash that returns to Italy, to Italian artisans and Italian manufacturers. This new cash will help in the rejuvenation of our economy, and will help propel us into an Italian century!"
itaintro.24.a:0 "Salute!"

itaintro.25.t:0 "Suez Sunrise" ##Bad trade will naturally go away in 10 years, Suez is VERY important
itaintro.25.d:0 "Another day, another shift for the many soldiers and sailors stationed in the many military installations in Suez. The Egyptian sun is as ruthless as it always was, but in recent times something has changed indeed: more and more ships pass through the Canal with each passing day.\n\nJapan, India, China, Australia, Thailand: Suez is turning more and more into a true Babel of languages and races, all passing through under the watchful eye of the Regia Marina.\n\nSince the creation of Atlantropa, Suez became the jugular vein of the Italian Empire, the one passage that connects the Mediterranean with the rest of the world's waters. Italy's monopoly over it is a vital asset for the Empire, and thus it should be no surprise that the place is one of the most heavily fortified regions in the world, dotted with military installations, bunkers, outposts and fortifications.\n\nLosing Suez is synonymous with losing the Empire, and everyone of some importance in Italy's government knows that perfectly."
itaintro.25.a:0 "The fate of our country rests on a canal?"

itaintro.27.t:0 "Italian Delegation Sent To Tokyo"
itaintro.27.d:0 "In a newly constructed building in the Bunkyō ward of Tokyo, the Italian Economic Delegation has finally set up shop. The culmination of the new trade deals recently undertook by Italy with Japan, the Delegation will serve as a board of businessmen and industrialists keeping contacts and renewing deals with Japanese zaibatsus and keiretsus, much to the advantage of Italian businesses selling and buying in the area.\n\nRepresentatives from ENI, Olivetti, Finmeccanica and even relatively minor ones like Ferrari will now have a direct link with the Far East, allowing the Italian government to reap the benefits of transoceanic trade."

ita_the_death_of_mussolini:0 "The Death of Mussolini"
ita_the_death_of_mussolini_desc:0 "Our glorious leader, Benito Mussolini, has passed on from this world. The exact cause of his death may have been humiliatingly having a stroke and being hung from his balcony upside down, but he was still the greatest, most honourable man in Italy and the Caesar to the Triumvirate alliance, meaning he must be presented to the populace with a bit more dignity than he left with. After spinning his death into something that doesn't cause all Italians to immediately erupt into laughter, we will need to begin making the proper arrangements. First off, a state funeral was to be held that included opera performances, festivals, a grand military parade, the construction of huge statues all over the empire, and an entire month of mourning sufficient enough to faithfully serve his memory. Next, after the past is setted we must look to the future; specifically who shall replace Mussolini as Il Duce. This issue is of course made difficult due to the fact that Mussolini hadn't made any preparations whatsoever in case of his demise and there is no precedent dictating how to go about replacing him with a new Duce. The most obvious successor is of course Galeazzo Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law. Of course, he cannot simply take the mantle without first going through a long string of bureaucracy and politics."

He served Italy as a skilled foreign minister who both triumphed in war and peace, preferring the latter yet willing to wage the former. His great skill in international diplomacy, however, is what makes him extraordinary, with Albania even making him an honorary citizen out of appreciation of his service right before orchestrating their invasion. As such, he has always seemed to be the natural heir of Mussolini, and therefore should take the initiative to step up and be declared the new Duce. After he accepts the position, it will be up to him to take Italy by the hand and lead her through a new era, one characterised more by diplomacy, his specialty, rather than the warmongering of the previous decades. Italy is in a difficult position, surrounded by enemies, and we need a strong leader. We need someone willing to do whatever it takes to ensure our survival and prosperity, and if Ciano can survive the tests that he faces and fill the shoes Mussolini left, then we may just overcome yet again."

These past years have been rough on all of us, and many are feeling the already straining tensions in the alliance, meaning this conference will be a crucial point in deciding whether or not the Triumvirate has what it takes to persist for more than a few months. Due to the importance of such an occasion, we are planning on hosting this meeting on the Mediterranean island of Malta. This is due to the fact that Malta is small, although slightly larger from Atlantropa, secure, and centralised, allowing us to enforce security and keep the delegates safe. Everyone involved will be on their toes of course, and if we mess something up our fate could take a turn for the worse. It is likely that, if successful, this conference could become an annual occurrence, cementing our stability and bringing the great nations together as friends. Now, it is time to go forth and send the invitations to Iberia and Turkey, all the while hoping they too believe in supporting this new wave of diplomacy."

ita_propose_joint_interventions_desc:0 "Not much has been happening with the Triumvirate outside of a couple of meetings, and many in Italy view it as high time we start actually working with Iberia and Turkey. After all, we wouldn't be much of an alliance if we didn't help each other every now and then. Therefore, it has been suggested by some Italian officials that we form a joint task force that doubles as both a means to effectively eradicate rebels in our colonies and a way to present Italy's honest intentions to our sceptical neighbors. Of course, many of these attacks on insurrectionists will need to be far from Algeria and the Levant, as this would only cause further conflict among the allies. Specifically, we should create a program in the Balkans region to deal with the many, many partisans alongside the Turks, giving us an opportunity to both work together while simultaneously removing the thorn that is insane guerillas from our side. We must be careful, however, as we wouldn't want to give our new friends too much access to our military secrets, and it would be quite terrible if some of our soldiers accidentally, or purposefully, shoot each other, which would likely end with the immediate dissolution of the Triumvirate."

ita_avoid_the_border_issues:0 "Avoid the Border Issues"
ita_avoid_the_border_issues_desc:0 "Our victory in the Second World War reaped many spoils for the Empire, mostly in the form of former British and French colonies in Africa and the Middle East. Many of these territories, most notably Algeria, Syria, and especially Cyprus, have been a source of contention with Iberia and Turkey. In Algeria, many settlers from Italy and Iberia converged inwards at a rapid pace, a process that has recently lead to disputes over the former French land. And the island of Cyprus, which was formerly a territory under the Ottoman Empire, was given to us rather than the Turks, leading to much hostility on their part. These issues have not disappeared with the formation of the Triumvirate, and if they are not settled soon, will likely become its downfall. Therefore, it has been suggested that we seek to both limit our involvement in the trouble zones while simultaneously speaking with our allies in an attempt to end this potentially deadly dispute. It is worth noting that, even if Ciano had any intention of conceding our new colonies, nobody in the mainland would support such a proposal and it would certainly see him out of office. As such, a permanent solution is nearly impossible."
ita_pussy_out:0 "It is very obvious to all members of the alliance that this is one of convenience rather than anything else. The disputes between all three of us are many, and in the name of stability we must avoid all discussion of these."

ita_meet_with_the_council:0 "Meet with the Council"
ita_meet_with_the_council_desc:0 "Although everybody and their uncle believes that Ciano will be the next Duce, formality requires that the Grand Council of Fascism meet to debate and make an official decision regarding succession. The Council, consisting of the senior ranking officials of the Fascist Party and many members of the Italian Senate, has been quickly assembled in Rome, awaiting the start of the conference. The delegates will discuss everything about the character of Ciano, painstakingly analyzing his loyalty, ability to lead, and intentions of reformation. Even the most irrelevant, miniscule detail has been uncovered, from conversations forty years ago to descriptions of his attire. During the middle of the forum, they will even call Ciano himself to the floor in an effort for him to explain himself and what he has done and would do for Italy. The decision that they are expected to reach upon the conclusion of the meeting is that the Council will find it in the empire's best interests to both nominate and sponsor Ciano for the position of Duce. Not even the biggest sceptics think that Ciano will have any difficulty securing the Grand Council's support, but anything is possible in this strange, strange world."

The King, who has reigned since the death of Victor Emmanuel III, is a symbol of the new Italy, much as the new Duce is. Relations between His Majesty and the Duce can be expected to be cordial: Ciano is a much more moderate leader, and less of a radical fascist. Given that some extreme fascists have called for the end of the Monarchy in the past, the House of Savoy will be relieved to have an ally as Duce. The King and the Duce can be expected to discuss several matters, ranging from the state of the Italian colonial empire, to Italy's relationship with Germany, the economy, and the pressing situation with the Triumvirate."

We must make sure that we spare no expense in the ceremony, and do everything we can to show the power of Italy. Rome itself will need to be prepared for such an event. Military marches and security must be prepared, logistics shall be coordinated, and roads shall be closed so that Ciano can get to the Quirinal and not be caught up by the cheering crowds. We must use the swearing in of Ciano to show that Italy is not weak. To this end, we should make sure that this event is broadcasted far and wide, from New York to Tokyo, show we can show the whole world, from our allies in the Triumvirate, to the leaders of OFN and the Co-Prosperity Sphere, to even our enemies in the Unity-Pakt that Italy is still one of the greatest and most nations on the planet!

Obviously, Germany is off the table for cooperation, seeing as they have been quite hostile towards us, but that just puts us into the perfect position to gain support from the United States and the Japanese. Both have shown themselves more than willing to help any and all enemies of the Reich, and it would only make sense for us to go to them for potential aid. We have already spoke with America, albeit briefly, about the prospect of sending over some military equipment and personnel to help train our men, and so far they have seemed willing. Therefore we must redouble our efforts with them while simultaneously sending diplomats over to Tokyo to try and get military aid that way. Maybe, in the future, we can even escalate these talks and secret deals into an actual alliance that would serve to give us total protection from the Nazis, but that would take a lot more time and effort to accomplish."

We cannot hope to keep them at bay for long, and only through reaching out and making new allies with our Mediterranean brothers Iberia and Turkey can we hope to deter their aggression. Although some disputes exist between us and our opinions of each other are quite poor, the direness of the situation will certainly force them to work with us. Even if they don't like us one bit, by initiating these talks and extending an olive branch we can achieve the impossible and safeguard our future from our mutual enemy, the Reich. Ciano himself, a skilled diplomat, will take personal charge in leading this new foreign policy. We are only hoping that our Mediterranean neighbors at least give us a chance to explain ourselves without acting like the fools most Italians think they are and turning us away."

If we want this new alliance to work out, we will surely be forced into cooperation, meaning it is time to send a diplomatic envoy to Ankara with the purpose of trying to smooth over our tense relationship and prepare them for an official conference. Hopefully, the Middle Eastern border situation and disputed claims in the Mediterranean will not come up in our first attempt at contact so as to keep the engagement as positive as possible. We will, however, be sure to mention how Atlantropa has destroyed both of our economies and the German Reich, a mutually hated enemy, is to blame. Doing so will surely make the Turkish upset and more willing to do whatever it takes to get back at the Germans. If all goes well, we will have a great opportunity to advance the talks and establish a formal alliance. If not, then this whole thing will be over before it even began."
ita_approach_the_kebab:0 "Turkey has also been betrayed by Germany, perhaps we can find common ground with these fanatics?"

ita_approach_the_iberians:0 "Approach The Iberians"
ita_approach_the_iberians_desc:0 "It will be necessary, in order to successfully form a Mediterranean alliance, to reach out to the Iberian Union and attempt diplomatic initiatives towards the Spanish and Portuguese. This will be quite tricky, as the two nations in the Union are infamous for disagreements and endless bureaucracy, meaning without them having massive support for our plan it is likely to not come to fruition. So by sending diplomats to Madrid and Lisbon, and taking these matters slowly, we can hope to reach both the Caudillos and the people's ears. One issue that is on our side, however, is that the Iberians hate the Germans as much as we do, and Atlantropa has devastated their economy as well. We just have to avoid mentioning the Algerian issue or making any promises we don't intend on keeping, like subsidizing the Gibraltar Dam. If we are successful, and have Iberia on our side, we will know that this alliance can be realized and Ciano can achieve his plan for stopping the Germans from taking advantage of us or our neighbors anymore."
ita_approach_the_tapas:0 "The Iberians only exist due to the squeeze Germany has put them under. It shall be easy making friends with our distant cousins on the peninsula."

Knowing beforehand that Türkeş had quite a hot temper and deep anti-German sentiments, Ciano decided to convince him that it was in Turkey's best interests to come together to counter the Reich. Il Duce is also planning on both announcing support for Turkey's claims on Azerbaijan and again mentioning the damages left by Atlantropa in an attempt to show the Turkish Başbuğ that Italy feels their pain and wants to do everything in his power to alleviate it. Near the end of the two men's meeting, Ciano is planning on formally announcing his intentions for a full alliance and economic pact as a means to mutual prosperity. So as long as Türkeş doesn't do or say anything insanely short-sighted and nationalistic, this could be a major turning point in the two nation's histories, and a great step towards Ciano's dream of a Mediterranean bloc."

They have ruled the Iberian Union together with unlimited power and ultimate authority, and any attempt at an alliance with Iberia must go through them first. As such, Ciano himself is climbing into the two spider's webs and will try to both get the two to agree to cooperation and raise anti-German sentiments as a means to make them appear to be natural allies. Il Duce will have to be careful, however, as one wrong move and one of the finicky dictators is likely to shut down and end all negotiations right then and there. Iberia and Italy haven't exactly seen eye to eye in the last decade, and many people are doubtful of our chances to mend the rift between us. But diplomacy is Ciano's specialty, and we have every confidence in his ability to achieve a favorable outcome and ensure Iberia's entrance into our new alliance. And if he is unsuccessful, well, nobody can say that we didn't try to reach out to our neighbors."

The Iberians and Turks are well aware of our diplomatic advances, and so far have yet to refuse them. We shall now move on to Ciano's grand plan of creating a Mediterranean alliance focused around the three powers, a pact which will ensure our survival in the face of the German menace and give us hope for the future. We shall be known, from now until Europe is saved, as the Triumvirate. Much like the Triumvirates of ancient Rome, we will be the three great leaders who lead the world into a new era, an era were we can be safe and secure from any threat, be it economic or militaristic. We shall rule our empires with an ironfist and hearts of roses, as dictators who love their people. And when the time comes when we are put to the final test of battling the leering Nazis beyond the Alps, we will give them hell! This is what Il Duce desires, and it is high time we bring Turkey and Iberia in on the plan. Hopefully they will view this as necessary and beneficial as we do, and act wisely in regards to joining this alliance. After all, it would be quite embarrassing to have a Triumvirate without the trium."

But as fate brings pain and humiliation onto the strong and pure nations of the world, so too does it give them the strength to rise against their oppressors. Germany was able to unify first, and as brothers should, they lent us a hand in their own struggle. It is thanks to Germany that there is a Italian at all, and we are forever in their debt. But it was Italy that first cast off the binds of pathetic liberalism, Jewish bolshevism, and western cowardice. When the first Duce, Benito Mussolini, lifted our nation from the dirt. It was he who inspired the eternal Führer, Adolf Hitler, to do the same in the north. We fought together in the second Weltkrieg, greatest of all wars, Germans bled for the Italian Empire, and Italians for Lebransaum. We are brothers in blood, in steel, and in truth. Friends first, and above all. More recently, our nations have been joined once again in suffering. Perfidious liberals, distorters of the true National Socialist way, false fanatics and cowards alike seek to turn us against each other, and weaken the Axis that built the New Order.

But is that the REAL truth? And given our ongoing rapprochement with the Germans, even if the response to that question is "yes of course it is, read any book or go outside and look at the beach for a few seconds", is it necessarily the most convenient truth? Maybe what really happened was that everything was all good, then the treacherous Iberians decided to attack the Gibraltar dam, seizing it from Germany and changing the water level to screw everyone in the Mediterranean but them. Maybe Jewish terrorists attacked both dams, and it was only the heroic intervention of a joint Italian and German team that managed to descend the Gibraltar straits. Maybe some of those dissidents the government's been locking up lately had something to do with it. All of these are clearly strong theories worth investigating in the court of public opinion.

All of our worst fears have been confirmed, and we now know exactly what happened. While the Duce was waking up in the morning and preparing to spend another day keeping Italy safe, a four foot tall Spaniard lept in from the balcony and began firing a revolver at Mussolini. However, the Duce quickly responded and bravely tried to fend off this mysterious attacker with nothing but a bottle of wine and his will to survive. Sadly, just as our great leader was about to land a killing blow, three more assailants jumped into his room and peppered him with bullets. As a servant ran into the room to find the source of all the commotion, she was shocked to find Mussolini on his bed bleeding out, only able to say his last words, a cry for vengeance. Now that we know the full story of the Duce's demise, it is our obligation to his memory to not only bring justice to the Iberian snakes but also let the whole world know of this wicked act."

If he makes too many changes and liberalizes too quickly, he will soon find himself at odds with most of the traditional fascists. If he does too little and maintains an oppressive authoritarian regime, then he risks betraying Italy and his people.

Fascism needs to be updated for a colonial empire that exists on the ground, rather than just in the hearts and minds of its citizens. The blackshirts and the harsh laws they enforce were necessary to purify the Italian state, but now serve only to keep it in the past.

It is the opinion of Ciano and the grand council that the benefits that this development brings to Italy, in the enhancement of Italy's "soft power" and the weakening of enemy regimes from the inside, outweighs the potential cost of subversion. Hence, it is time to spread this spirit of innovation throughout the nation, and to make de-facto what had been previously de-jure. Though some hardliners have raised concerns about the potential ramifications of this approach regarding the strength and moral character of the Italian people, thes extremists have been overruled and their names marked as potentially disloyal.

Although nowhere near as troublesome as their German equivalents, they have as of late been a little too rambunctious. Many local police stations have been complaining about members of the blackshirts disregarding the law for years, with public intoxication and disorderly conduct being the two most common charges. As such, Ciano has decided to meet with their leaders personally to ensure that a stronger hand will be used to reign in the militiamen and keep them off the streets where they seem to cause the most issues. Ciano is sure that they will listen, as they have declared loyalty solely to him, Il Duce, and will respect his wishes in full.

Already, the new generation of students and young adults are crying out for freedom and other such nonsense, and if we don't give them a voice, albeit a quiet and controlled one, they may turn to the socialists or some other militants to accomplish their goals. Along with this, much of Italy is still conservative, and allowing more citizens to speak will give them a chance to support Il Duce and his reforms in the future.

Count Ciano has decided that this area is ripe for reform. First, the broad regulations so-often used by hardline judges to pick unnecessary fights will be narrowed, only prohibiting films guilty of "pornography, drug use, sedition, miscegenation, or overt rebellion", and allowing directors to over-dub or remove the offending sections to remove their film from the blacklist. Second, the power of film censorship will be moved from the Ministry of Information to the Ministry of Culture, where it will be performed by a council not only of fascist officials, but actors, writers, and directors as well. Finally, the government shall begin instituting a limited amount of grant money for the production of "patriotic and heroic films", to strengthen these trends within the industry.

The law was only used once before the war in which Mussolini took absolute control, but was reinstated during elections afterward when Mussolini began his policy of rolling back his power to 1920's levels. Ciano, wishing to take these reforms a step further, is now attempting to change the text of these laws. By returning the system back to one of proportional representation, he is hoping that the people, both in other parties and the general public, will appreciate his new regime more and support his reforms in the future.

There is hardly a street free of their accursed pamphlets, while even the most obviously degenerate of the banned films draws hundreds of students to underground theatres. Ciano has previously instructed the police and blackshirts to deal with these spoiled children gently, and above all quietly, but thanks to the growing polarization of Italian society even these have the potential to escalate into crisis'. In this time of popular upheaval, the party's favorite tactics of midnight blackshirt raids and tragic "suicides" of dissidents that others should learn from are no longer feasible. Therefore our great leader has decided to rescind nearly all existing youth restrictions, ranging from protest prohibitions, curfews, banned student groups and academic blacklists.

While he knows that it would be political suicide to eliminate the more connected individuals, it will be possible to remove the extreme outliers of the party. By sending just a couple of his most loyal blackshirts to meet with these buffoons, Ciano can ensure that they are either stripped of all power or arrested so as to no longer cause any problems. It is unlikely that anybody will mourn their loss anytime soon, however we are worried that this will cause outcry amongst the traditional fascists who may believe that they could be the next ones to be shown the door.

The rot has grown so much that it is possible that the Parliament may even vote against Il Duce! Furthermore, the rot of democracy seems to be winning over more and more of the so called representatives! No true Italian would ever want democracy, so why would their representatives want it? We could purge the parliament of the traitors, but that could cause issues and make Ciano look paranoid. Instead, we can make all votes conducted through secret paper ballots to 'guarantee safety'. Instead of making the votes more safe however, this allows us to count the votes and change them if need be. No one will know, as the votes will be secret, and we can ban asking others about their vote as to prevent even a chance that this brilliant idea will be found out."

Over the past few years however, as the old Duce focused elsewhere, the censors became more lax, or even became degenerate themselves, allowing this evil to reenter the beautiful Italian society. With Ciano's ascension, things that were once ignored are now being looked at, and the level of degeneracy in Italy has become totally exposed. It is clear that we must toughen our censors in order to end this issue. We must ban degenerate movies, destroy all degenerate music, and launch thorough sweeps of Italian society so that all degenerates and their ideas, no matter what form they present themselves in, are completely removed from Italy and its society."

Why should we change something that has obviously worked incredibly well for Italy? Of course, Il Duce is merciful, and he believes that only purging them from the party is necessary to prevent them from gaining too much power. It is much better a fate than they deserve. Perhaps looking from the outside will show them just why Italian Fascism is a perfectly working machine, with no issues whatsoever?"

However, one more thing is missing. The people, while they understand, or are at least trying to understand, that Ciano is great, they do not understand that Ciano is the personification of perfection. The only way someone could ever become the leader of the best country on Earth is by being perfect. Ciano, in being perfect, is therefore never wrong. While the people may doubt that anyone could ever be this perfect, they are wrong. Il Duce will show the population how he is utterly amazing through examples.

Much like the Romans of old, we must work steadily to preserve this new empire if we wish to maintain dominion over them. We shall work with our most loyal servants in the colonies to keep the people satisfied with our rule and expand Italian influence in the regions. If we can manage to retain the territories in this new era, it will have to be a product of them learning to love us as their parents, with Ciano their father and Italy their mother.

But in the aftermath of the Second World War, our empire truly grew to massive size with the acquisition of Egypt and the Sudan, the Suez Canal, Tunisia, the rest of East Africa, and a few more odd territories from the fallen empires of Britain and France. But now we are in a new age where colonialism and imperialism is thought to be outdated, and many are calling for decolonization. This will put us in a difficult position, and if we wish to keep our possessions then we will have to struggle tooth and nail for them, as the locals will likely fight for independence just as ruthlessly.

Unlike our other colonies, Libya is integrated directly into the empire. In the cities of Tripoli, Benghazi, and Misrata, one hears Italian far more often than Arabic, and those mosques that remain are tucked away, hidden beneath the grandeur of the settler's cathedrals. Of course, there remain challenges. Bandits and tribesmen still hassle our settlers, while the villages and slums that line the coast remain the domains of the natives and their primitive faith.

Here the Italian presence is limited to a dirty guard post, a few drunk Blackshirts to man it, and a flag on its wall obscured by Arabic slogans. A few kilometers more, and the unnamed citizen would be in the desert, with nothing but sand dunes, tribesman, and death to keep him company. The time has come for Italy's settlers to reclaim the legacy of our nation's great explorers, and venture into the hinterlands. We will begin by establishing small ports and restoring bases along the Libyan cost, in Adibijaya, Brega, Ras Lunaf, Sirte, Masalla, Derna, and Tobruk .

However, when the Italian soldiers ventured into their new territory, they found it stricken with chaos. French remnants, Arab revolutionaries, Berber tribes and desert nomads all vied for supremacy. The territory had to be placed under martial law, and units sent in surplus to eliminate the insurgents. With all the chaos, what few settlers arrived didn't stay long. After almost 20 years of Italian military administration, Tunisia is a bit quieter. Italian soldiers are still subject to the occasional ambush or roadside bomb attack, but buy and large they go about their duties in peace.

The Levant is plagued with Jewish-Arabic tensions, our hold on Egypt is getting worryingly weak since the '56 revolution, and East Africa continues to be nothing but a financial burden. Despite all these problems, we need to help our vassals shore up their weaknesses, whether it is reinforcing Amadeo in his reforms in Eastern Africa, helping quell ethnic tensions in the Levant by giving the people there more freedom, and perhaps even allowing Farouk to do as he pleases in hopes that he will eventually understand the importance of ruling Egypt."

All it takes for us to keep him loyal is to fuel his elaborate lifestyle, which while expensive is a small price to pay for stability in Egypt. By throwing some money at him that we would have given to the administration of the colony, he can buy his stuffed birds and big parties with all the wine in the world, and in turn he will do what we say and when we say it. As long as he doesn't do anything insane like bankrupt Egypt he will be kept in power, and our officials can remain in Cairo to control the policy and actual governance that nobody expects him to partake in.

Now, the Ethiopian government spends far too much on educating the natives in things their primitive minds will soon forget, and healing them of every minor injury, and far too little on actually producing anything for Rome. And still, Amadeo demands more money, more soldiers, more help from his home country which has more than enough problems on its own.

Therefore, in order to find a solution to the problem before it even really becomes one, it has been decided to pursue a policy of relocating many of the nonessential Arabs back into the Libyan Desert as a way to keep them out of sight and, as a result, out of mind. This all will be accomplished through incentives and land grants for the willing and forced relocation for those who wish to stay.

The French government, facing rebellion and economic collapse proved unable to control the region beyond a handful of outposts on the coast, and Algeria fell to anarchy. Mussolini quickly recognized the opportunity to further Italian control of the Mediterranean and sent thousands of soldiers and settlers, restoring order and public safety, and adding another jewel to the crown of the Italian Empire. Unfortunately, Italy isn't the only European country interested in Africa, and the Iberian Caudillos have set about expanding their own influence in the region. Now, Algeria is a mish mash of control, with Italy dominant in the desert south and mountainous east, and the Iberians holding the more populated western coast.

First off, we are guaranteed to gain much admiration and respect from Iberia who will now be much more confident in their commitment to the Triumvirate. It will also prevent any conflicts over a useless piece of desert from destroying our nations and possibly causing another world war. And even if we could own all of Algeria, what good would it do us? We would inherit nothing but sand, angry locals that are likely to eventually rise up, and an upset France.

Finally, there is, as there always seems to be, the problem of Atlantropa. The damned thing has ruined the ports of the island, and while there are new ones being built, it is slow and painful.

Along with the soldiers, we must also increase the supplies and food that we ship to the island so that the people don't starve and can hopefully view us as saviors rather than imperialist animals without regard of their livelihood.

Judea will blossom under the light of Rome, and if the Arabs don't like that, well, we will have to use very convincing methods to make them stay put. The garrison in the Levant shall be used in full force to crack down on protests and Arab militias who dare question the will of Rome, and to keep the barbarians of the region in check until our loyal Jewish subjects are safe in their own homes."

These territories include the regions bordering the Adriatic Sea, or at least what's left of it, Croatia, Albania, and the Hellenic State. We have so far been successful in maintaining our influence in the zones due to our military presence and friendly collaborators, but every day is a constant struggle against partisans and guerilla freedom fighters. In the future, if we wish to keep a hold on the Balkans, it will become necessary to increase our efforts towards eliminating our enemies and working with our friends so as to stay in power. If we neglect the territories for too long, it will surely lead to open rebellion or even war. And the last thing any sane person in Italy or elsewhere wants is another conflict to spring up in the Balkans, as it would only cause mass suffering and pain for anyone involved."

The territory was a crucial jumping point for our actions in the Balkans during the Second World War, giving us the opportunity to launch attacks against both Yugoslavia and Greece. The area, like most of our colonies, has seen a recent influx of Italian settlers in recent years, leading to more conflict in the region between the locals and the immigrants. If we wish to avoid any blood from being spilled in the future over these issues, it may be wise for us to actively begin working with the Albanian collaborators. By reaching out to them and putting them into more positions of power, we can hope to give the locals a voice in their own lands while preserving the peace. While many of the traditionalist and militaristic fascists will disagree with any local autonomy whatsoever, it may be the only hope we have of maintaining an empire.

And as we learned with the Fourth Shore, the best way to obtain absolute control of a place is for us to turn the area Italian via settlers bringing their families and culture into the territory. These Italians will be skilled workers and hardened laborers willing to turn Albania into an integral and proud state of Italy proper while bringing the bounty of the land into our economy. Although this will certainly bring some trouble and attention from Albanian nationalists and freedom fighters, they wouldn't dare attack us facing such odds that would be brought upon by tens of thousands of loyal Italians ready to protect their nation. Our lapdogs in the collaboration government will certainly appreciate a more civilised and loyal populace and any who dare oppose the empire will be silenced by our presence and authority.

If we ever wish to truly control Albania, Ciano knows that he must first gain the people's trust, and to do so he will need to make certain promises. Chief among these promises will be the preservation of the Albanian people and culture, as many locals fear the rising number of Italian emigrants to the region and are afraid of becoming a minority in their own land. Next we will promise them safety, safety from their Balkan enemies and from the Italian Empire alike by giving them a little bit of local autonomy in exchange for their loyalty. Ciano knows that to rule over lands, the people must have respect for him and for Italy, and this is not achieved by murdering and pillaging like the Germans and Japanese, but by respecting their right to exist, like the Roman Empire of old, which coincidentally lasted much longer than the other two ever will."

As a response, we created the obedient Hellenic State as our puppet regime with the goal of using collaborators to help put down any and all revolts in the region. This has been going moderately well, however in the recent turmoil, nationalists have been resurging and tensions are running high. Rome knows that the only way to maintain a hold on Greece is to put men and resources into the Hellenic State so as to reinforce the local garrison and the small collaborationist army. These new soldiers will act as peacekeepers and anti-terrorist operatives meant to stop a rebellion before it even occurs. Hopefully the mere presence of elite Italian soldiers will make the nationalist guerillas think twice about making any attacks against our great empire. We must tread carefully, however, as too much military presence could send a bad message to our Greek friends, and the last thing we want is for anybody to defect to the rebels' cause."

It has now become time for the new Duce, Galeazzo Ciano, to address this issue once and for all and decide their fate. And Ciano, like the diplomat that he is, has decided to reach out and connect with these lost souls in an attempt to find where they belong. As of now, they are currently residing around Benito, the state comprising of the former Adriatic Sea, where they are near many of their ethnic brethren. The question now, however, is whether to let them remain in this desolate wasteland, where the Italian government would likely have to help them survive, or force them out into the Balkans, where they will have to fend for themselves. Although Ciano already has his mind set on the former, many of the old traditional fascists would rather see the latter come to fruition, and there is still yet time to decide. What is certain, however, is that the lives of these Slavs are in Italy's hands, and whether she embraces them or crushes them is her choice alone."

However, refugees are notoriously a rather undiscerning lot, and for the hordes that managed to escape the German Reich during the chaos of the early 50s, any sort of salvation was preferable to death and slavery back home. Even now there have been no definite counts of the refugee population, though the figures likely run while into the millions. Many were initially housed in vast government run camps, while others sought refuge with families or in ethnic enclaves. Though the refugees are relatively few in comparison to the native population and highly concentrated, their presence has greatly incensed our Italian citizens, and serves as one of the main selling points for hardliners in the Fascist Movement. The time has come to more effectively integrate the refugees into the Italian state and society. Ciano proposes to do this with a quota system for Italy's puppets and some of its least favorite provincial leaders, and incentives for the rest. The refugees will be housed (temporarily) at the cost of the state, and given free (mandatory) lessons in Italian language and culture. Naturally, once employed they will be required to pay the government back for its kindness, but they don't need to know that."

And we have a very simple and easy way to remove them, and that is by giving them one week to completely vacate our territory or else be handed over to the Germans to face a fate far worse than death. This may be cruel, and could make us look evil, and may very well alienate all allies or friends we have on this planet, but it must be done to cleanse their filth from our great nation. And besides, we are positive that Serbia and Croatia will be more than happy to take them in, and no problems could arise as a result of this wise and well thought out decision.

The place oozes wickedness and many in Rome can see that the Croatian government cares very little about staying loyal to Italy and her people. Therefore, before anything gets too out of hand, it will become necessary to observe the Croats closely in order to be prepared to take preemptive action as we see fit. A few spies here, a couple of bribed bureaucrats there, and before we know it we shall become aware of every little thing going on inside Zagreb.

Ravalli's experience in Greece has made him accustomed to these sorts of exercises, and we expect him to be very successful in this endeavour. Ravalli's mantra is simple, he would rather see our subjects understand one thing-fear. The fear of pain and the fear of death. The expedition will leave shortly, comprising of Ravalli himself, our most elite counter-insurgents, and our fastest armoured vehicles, all with the sole purpose of making the rebels burn for daring to strike our glorious empire.

One thing is certain, however, and that is that no one is placing bets in favor of the Greek guerillas who still believe they have a chance to liberate their home country. Good sport aside, this exercise will serve two more purposes; one being the removal of tough rebels in the occupied Hellenic State and another that of having a chance to work and train side by side with our ally.

Though Tito's terrorist militia has been far from benevolent towards the local population, our periodic searches have so far produced little results. Indeed, the the residents of the Italian balkans seem far more likely to warn Tito of our actions than to help us find him. Overall, Tito's influence remains relatively limited, but in the context of Italy's economic stagnation, growing dissident problem, and the rending of the Triumvirate alliance, the government has decided that Tito needs to be found sooner rather than later. So the soldiers will go out again, into this strange land. They will visit the same villages, and walk past graffiti proclaiming 'FREE YUGOSLAVIA' on top of graffiti proclaiming 'FREE SERBIA'.

However, after the Second World War ended, most of this land, including Cyprus, the Levant, and parts of Syria, were transferred unto Italy rather than their original owner, much to the anger of Turkish militants. The nationalist regime, led by Alparslan Türkeş, in control of Turkey has, in a not-so-shocking move, claimed most of these colonies as rightful Turkish land. This issue has been a constant roadblock in our nation's relationship even before the creation of the Triumvirate, and has only escalated in recent years. Therefore, we must try our absolute hardest to keep the Turks from trying to press these claims during this years conference in Malta. Even though in our heart of hearts we know there will be no territorial concessions whatsoever, we must keep Turkey in the dark and let them believe that it is still a possibility, if only they wait. We have been laying this reuse upon our ally for a while now, however, and many are doubting our ability to keep them fooled.

And now that our settlers have reached each other, tensions are running high as both countries refuse to back down, with each wanting to own that precious land. And while we have a territorial conflict brewing, Iberia is also upset at the fact that we haven't exactly been paying our dues for the maintenance of the Gibraltar Dam, which acts as a barrier that stops the entire Atlantic Ocean from drowning us. This isn't our fault, however, as economic downturn and general misfortune has left us poor and Iberia relatively well off. All of this could spell disaster if brought up in the Malta conference, so we must make a few offers beforehand as a way to appease them. The easiest thing that we can do is give a little bit of money for the dam, and promise some more money that we don't have and don't intend to pay.

Many in Rome are scared of the possible outcomes of the conference and are anxiously asking hard questions. Will we come together and solidify the alliance? Will we have to give out a few concessions to appease them? Or will the Triumvirate collapse in on itself as a result or squabbling? What will happen if the alliance does fall apart?

The letter will also hint at other points such as the possibility for full detente and open trade in order to align our two paths in the future, along with official ramifications, such as formally recognizing Speer's regime and showing our support for his legitimacy. Hopefully, the Germans will understand this and see it as the sign to begin creating diplomatic ties with one another in order to ease tensions and bring about a new era of peace. If all goes according to plan, the reply from Germania will have similar meaning and will be the signifier for an escalation of such diplomacy. This will be the first test of many for the new dictator, but if he passes the fate of the world will shift significantly in our favor. The envoy carrying the letter and a few gifts will arrive in the German capital by plane as soon as possible, so as to ensure Italy is acknowledged first and foremost by the new heirs of Europe."

These included elite Alpini and armoured units, some of the best available to the armed forces, to be indefinitely garrisoned on the Austrian border. Here they have trained and built up enough defenses that any invasion can be stalled long enough for full mobilization. Due to the insanity caused by the civil war, Italian High Command even increased the number of infantry units as a deterrent to any raids by the combatting parties. Now, In order to send a clear message to Albert Speer and the liberalizing Reich, it would serve our best interests to move the armoured divisions back down South, away from Germany, along with a quarter of the infantry troops. The German government is expected to perform a similar gesture, although not many soldiers are even on our border due to the recent civil war, in which case we will even further withdrawal our forces. The Alpini will stay however, for the German wolf is not to be trusted so easily, and no matter what happens or what Germania says, we aren't taking one damned soldier off of the defensive fortifications on our border with Burgundy. We can't be fools in our quest for peace."

Not too far from the truth, all things considered. Every newspaper, radio broadcast, poster, and speech has reflected such sentiments, and it hasn't exactly been helpful towards improving our shattered relations. As much as it pains us, the sheer amount of anti-German propaganda is a black mark on Italy in Germany's eyes. If we want any hope of detente with the German Reich, scaling back these barrages of hate would probably be a step in the right direction. At least the government should stop endorsing such propaganda and instead work on more positive messages, like the chance of being friends with Germany like in the old days. We aren't going to censor such messages, however, as Germanophobia is so strong in Italy that doing so would be akin to political suicide, with many of the general populace seeing it as a sign of weakness if we just ignore all the wrongs done upon us by the Reich. With these reforms, Speer should have no obstacle in the way of reconciliation and no excuse for not re-establishing diplomatic ties, something that is necessary for both our nation's survival."

We plan on initiating this procedure by creating new diplomatic channels with the Germans so that Germania and Rome can have direct communications from now on. This will involve Italy sending a direct correspondent to their capital, and them sending a correspondent to ours. Also, we also plan on creating a new phone line through the war-torn Germany so that, in emergencies, we will be able to quickly get in touch. One of the primary reasons for these new channels is so that whenever one country is going about creating policies or foreign connection, they will be able to coordinate and consult with the other. This is especially important for Italy, who still feels the betrayal at the hands of the Germans when they created the Gibraltar Dam and drained the mediterranean, against Italy's wishes, and destroyed her economy. It also serves as a signifier to the rest of Europe, specifically to Iberia and Turkey, that Italy is working with the Reich now, and if they are wise they too will engage in the policy of reconciliation. And if they decide to hold onto their hate and vengeance, then Italy might just have a powerful ally soon to back her up."

This will be the end of official hostility towards each other, and although much has yet to be improved, we can finally announce to the public that whatever the future holds, Germany and Italy shall face it as friends, not foes. A ceremony, unmatched by any in history in grandiose and splendor, is being planned to take place upon the opening of the embassy in Germania. The proceedings will be much like those in 1940 when Hitler and Mussolini met, formally bringing us together in the great war in a pact of steel. By participating in these celebrations, it is a way of mending the steel which for so long has lied rusted and bent. While no such announcement of a military alliance will occur, the public will feel like no issues exist between us. Our ambassador has already landed in the Reich, being met personally by Albert Speer and his entourage, and it is expected that our great leader will arrive soon, just in time for the party. It now appears that nothing can stop the progress we have made towards reconciliation, even with the many, many problems that yet remain to be solved."

The Atlantropa project ruined Italy's economy, forcing us into a massive recession that hurt millions of Italians. As a response, Italy turned away from the Reich, joining with Iberia and Turkey to form the anti-German Triumvirate. It appeared that Europe was just too small for her two most powerful empires to coexist. But then, Albert Speer took charge of Germany in the civil war. As a result, Italy shifted her policy of aggression into one of making amends, and Germany did likewise. However, not all of our problems have disappeared with Speer's arrival, and they won't for a long time. And while these issues persist, Germany and Italy can't advance from detente into partnership. Therefore, we should start making the public think that things are better than they actually are. This may be deceptive, but how can we improve our situation if our citizens aren't on board? We shall start gradually, with more military withdrawals from the border and mutual festivities, and eventually move onto making promises for economic cooperation and joint armed forces exercises. Maybe then we can get to actual legislation and deals that really do help Italy out."

The populace will know that Germany is no longer an immediate danger and they too can sleep soundly at night. And then, after such a statement, he will declare that the wine shall flow freely this night, in the first time since the victory in the world war, as a token of Italy's fortune and reconciliation with Germany. People from all over the world will be able to see that Italy stands triumphant over all of her troubles, and that she will stand tall! But after tonight, we must look beyond Speer and his Germans, at the many problems on the horizon. For although we have walked the path of peace hand in hand with the Reich, not all nations have chosen such a noble venture. Many, Burgundy foremost, would rather see the world burn again, for all the blood-shed of the past is not a lesson that people like to learn, but it may be one that Italy has to teach them! But we can save the world tomorrow, or maybe the next day considering the nationwide hangover that is sure to follow such a celebration."

However, there might be a solution. If we could convince the fascists of the PNF to play by democratic rules, we could solve two problems at once - winning over vast swathes of the PNF to Ciano's cause, while also strengthening the nascent democracy. Some members of the party, such as Giorgio Almirante, Augusto De Marsanich and other politicians close to Ciano, have proved receptive to this idea - perhaps, they could form the backbone of a new right wing party willing to engage in a democratic system."

Even Mussolini was a fierce critic of Germany, and we all know that fascism and nazism are completely different ideologies that only allied out of mutual convenience: Italy shall never fall into the claws of that crooked, antisemitic and violent system that has brought so much misery and suffering to Germany, and to all of Europe. We must take every opportunity to condemn these filthy wannabe traitors who lurk among our ranks and would love to see Italy as a subservient puppet of the Reich; we won't just use our propaganda to discredit them, but we shall also expel them from the Party with dishonor and jail their leaders for ideological treason, to make sure that they stop peddling their Nazi poison once and for all!"

Underground communist movements are still present in the country - and after democracy is introduced, we risk a rising tide of radical leftism. However, there is something we can do to amend this - if we allow the creation of a moderate leftist party to compete in the democratic race, we will create a powerful barrier to radicalism.

Many moderate leftists, scared by promises of economic liberalization, are starting to listen to radical socialist rhetoric, and a resurgence of left-wing radicalism is still a haunting possibility. Therefore, we shall officially begin talks and meetings with members of these factions to make sure that the transition towards democracy is a smooth and peaceful one, with constant and open dialogue between the different parties: at all costs, we must avoid all forms of radicalization and extremism among the various factions, and the only way to do this, is by making sure that change of all kinds must come through a slow, moderate and democratic process, not from the barrel of a gun."

Each person on the court will have to be reviewed multiple times to determine their loyalty and willingness to work with the Duce. The ones that Ciano decides are unfit for duty must be replaced shortly, so as to ensure that there is no backlash and the system keeps working." #duplicate loc key

ita_the_second_order_desc:0 "The elections draw ever closer, and the electoral trail is in full swing. Every party has named its candidate: politicians rally their voters in the squares of major cities all over the country to hold speeches, while even in the smallest and most isolated towns and villages of Italy, in the evening everyone gathers around a radio in town squares to listen to radio reports about the coming elections, as everyone, down to the humble farmers and workers, is able to comment freely and express his opinions without fearing repression, for the first time in decades. Everything has been going according to Ciano's plans, and now there's only one final push, one last order to be signed by the Duce before he can step down and let the people choose its next leader. The Blocchi Nazionali have proposed a system of bonuses for meritorious commanders and officers of the Regio Esercito, while the Democrazia Cristiana and the Fronte Democratico have proposed a series of tiny, liberal reforms as a show of goodwill on our part."

ita_army_lire_bonuses:0 "Army Lire Bonuses"
ita_army_lire_bonuses_desc:0 "Even as we liberalize the country, we must always keep stability and order as our guiding lights, our compass in navigating the difficult waters of international politics. The best way to always ensure stability is making sure that the army is well-funded and devoted to keep the country safe against all odds: in order to rest assured that we can always rely on our army, we will make sure that the officers and the soldiers know that the government will duly compensate them for their loyalty and bravery. Those military men who distinguished themselves in the heroic struggle against terrorism at home and insurrection in the colonies will receive bonuses in the form of more money: the greater their deeds, the greater the compensation. Liberals are worried that this is just a massive money sink, as such a system could be easily abused: however, the military has historically always been divided into ideological cliques, and this could be the most efficient solution to that problem."

ita_token_reforms:0 "Token Reforms"
ita_token_reforms_desc:0 "A little bit here, a little bit there: nothing truly substantial, but rather something done to send a message. This is what many prominent liberals have proposed on the eve of Ciano's retirement: a small loosening of censorship on newspapers, a slight bit of added economic freedom for large businesses, a tiny restriction to the police's powers, and so on, and so forth. Sure, many of these reforms won't even have a real effect on the lives of most Italians, but they sure won't pass unnoticed: the liberals have asked this merely to test just how far Ciano and the other fascists are willing to go, to see if their newfound love for democracy is real or a farce. Immediately, many close advisors to Ciano have criticized these demands as illegitimate, saying that all further liberal reforms should be postponed to after the elections and discussed in Parliament. However, it is true that if we don't consent to these reforms, we could easily be criticized because of our unwillingness to go that extra mile to cooperate with democratic forces, and that would somewhat sour the political atmosphere we worked so hard to create."

Galeazzo Ciano, for the last time, has stepped on the balcony of Palazzo Venezia, the very same balcony from which Mussolini gave so many speeches, and addressed the people of Italy for the last time as Duce. The square was packed with people, a massive crowd, with enormous Italian flags and banners praising the Duce waving in the wind: Ciano was often forced to interrupt his speech for long rounds of applause and cheering. As he spoke out to the people, he praised fascism and its glorious history, but also remarked the need for a renewed Italian democracy, one that would lift the country to ever greater heights: the authoritarian elements of fascism were useful in the past but a burden now, and had to be reformed if Italy was to keep its greatness in the future. As he ended his long speech and disappeared into the palace for the last time, the applause and cheering was even louder and longer. And then, slowly, the silence fell, as the people started to slowly realize what had just happened, and to ask themselves a question: what will happen now?"

Rumours, sometimes based on factual reports, sometimes bordering on paranoia, seem to imply that Iberian troops are gathering in northern Africa, potentially preparing for an offensive that might reach Tunis if unchecked. As some important members of the Italian military, including governor general Castellano, are already calling for mobilization, the Duce has ordered that a military action should only be taken as a last resort measure against Iberian. A crisis is on the horizon, and this might spell the end for peace in the western Mediterranean."

Now, a rift has opened between two different factions in the Italian government and military - many believe that this is clearly the prologue to a large scale offensive, as the Iberian settlers and their French allies are trying to seize the entire country for themselves. Governor general Castellano urges an immediate reaction, potentially one that will be able to repel the Iberians from Algeria entirely. On the contrary, some argue that the Iberians are expecting an Italian offensive, and thus are mobilizing to defend the country - thus, a diplomatic resolution to the crisis is still possible. ENI representatives in the country are especially worried about the prospect of a war, which would immensely harm oil extraction operations in the region."

While we are not interesting in escalating the hostilities into a full blown war with Iberia, we should be able to not only repel any offensives coming from Iberian backed militias, but also counterattack to ensure that Italy alone has control over Algeria, potentially to later cement it as a nation in our sphere of influence."

By dispatching experienced officers to these spread out units and outfitting them with modern APCs, IFVs and other vehicles in large numbers, we can reorganize them into a decentralized but effective mechanized fighting force, which will allow us to control the vast expanse of the Algerian territory much better than how we could manage using regular army units."

The deal was simple - Italy would allow self governance to natives and put forward vague promises of independence for Algeria in a yet to be decided future, and in exchange the FLN doesn't threaten Italian forces in the region. With a war on the horizon, we can entice the FLN to fight for us by doubling down on our past promises - which in the future we may or may not want to keep."

The objective of the operation is nothing less than to secure the entirety of Algeria within a short time period, at which point an attempt will be made to force the Iberian government to renounce all claims of controlling the country.

An economist and journalist suspected for his anti-fascist sympathies, Pirani was taken under Mattei's protective wing and made into his right hand man for Algerian affairs. Pirani has numerous contacts within the FLN and prominent diplomats on the Iberian side, especially Portuguese ambassador Alberto Moreira - and has become one of the most outspoken advocates for a diplomatic resolution to the Algerian crisis.

The first step to ensure a lasting peace with Iberia is making sure that the Algerian people is on board with it - many of them see both Italy and Iberia as colonizers, so we must reinforce our promises and commitment to a Algerian independence and democracy.

A long time activist who campaigned for independence when Algeria was under French rule, Hadj is often called the father of Algerian nationalism. After World War Two, Hadj accepted Italian control of western Algeria as a counter to Iberia's expansion plans over the region, especially considering that the Iberian authorities have always maintained a good relationship with the numerous pied noir militias that stalk the country. By using Hadj as the spokesman of our projects to return independence to Algeria, we will be able to gain popularity among the Algerian people, thus increasing our credibility and our clout in the coming negotiations."

Only ENI has the industrial and financial power necessary to set up large scale oil extraction infrastructures in Algeria, as Iberia simply lacks the industrial raw power necessary to set up such a large scale operation. The Iberians could cooperate with us, and get a fair share of the oil profits while at the same time avoiding a pointless war."

ita_promises_of_prosperity:0 "Promises Of Prosperity"
ita_promises_of_prosperity_desc:0 "As we started flirting with the Iberians regarding the immense profits that could be had by both countries in avoiding a war, it's time to further reinforce this by escalating our offers. While it's true that ENI possesses enough industrial power to set up shop in Algeria, the region would likely suffer from a shortage of workers, as the oil reserves are located in desertic and remote areas. Bringing workers from Italy would be costly and time consuming, but there already numerous Iberian citizens living as settlers in Algeria - by drafting large scale employ plans to allow Iberian settlers to work in ENI wells and pipelines would foster economic cooperations between the two countries, making both richer in the meanwhile."

According to the plan drafted by Pirani and Moreira, and to which the Duce has already consented to, Algeria will be ruled as a joint mandate. European settlers and native Algerians will be both represented in the new government, as Italian and Iberian armed forces will watch over the country - with the long term goal of establishing a free and independent Algeria."

We made our attempt to preserve peace in the Mediterranean - we can only hope that the Iberians are as reasonable as we have been."

But now, now we are in power, and we shall be the ones to restore our lost glory. Of course, the first step to curing a poison, as anyone with common sense knows, is to remove stop drinking from the wicked bottle that delivers the toxin. ANd as such, we must bring an end to the attempts to radically change the nation, so as to preserve what we have left and begin rebuilding what was lost. Let it be clear, nobody is going to turn Italy into a left wing cesspit, not while we have the ability to keep degeneracy's stewards at bay. "

ita_assure_democracy:0 "Assure Democracy's Wellbeing"
ita_assure_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is a very odd concept, the idea of the people choosing their leader through votes and fair elections. Just because we wish to restore Italy's greatness, many citizens of the empire view us as a great evil and threat to the health of the nation and the existence of democracy. However, this is not the case, we know that the people want to vote, and it is not our right to tear it away from them. We must quickly work to ensure that this point is known without a doubt, and to do so we will have Almirante himself broadcast his will to keep democratic principles alive and thriving in Italy. We may be traditionalists to the core, and much stronger than the other spineless politicians that corrupt Rome, but we are here to serve the people's interests."

We have accepted this system; it gives the people a feeling of importance and inclusion in the state of affairs. However, we know that our empire depends on a strong executive to wield the power granted upon him by the Italian citizenry, a leader who will bring us to greatness and keep this nation afloat in trying times. However, the people will have the ability to choose who this leader is, and while it may be a risk for us, the public has already given us a mandate of their approval. Now, it is time for Almirante to step forth as the powerful man necessary to maintain our position in the world and for us to give him the tools he needs to do so. All things considered, this democracy business has turned out quite well, as no good leader should command his people if he doesn't hold their respect, as we do now."

They say we are not what we say that we are, that we wish to revert Italy back to totalitarianism, and that we wish to see democracy removed from Italy. None of this is true, we are proud patriots who simply seek to help our great nation survive in these turbulent times. We are servants sent by God to deliver the nation into a place where everyone is safe and happy. As a response to this slander, it is our duty to make the truth evident to the hoi polloi and common masses. We will decry these rumors as false, and ensure our willingness to improve Italy with all the tools in our arsenal. We love this country, and she loves us; for it is us who were chosen to lead her. In, time, the public will share this view with us, if we only put in the effort to open their eyes."

ita_reassure_parliament_desc:0 "Sadly, we were unable to to secure every last seat in Parliament for our great and wonderful party, much to our disappointment. As such, we must deal with the other parties and play nice with them if we ever wish to pass legislation. To start, Almirante will personally deliver a speech unto Parliament stating our intentions clearly so as to not cause any doubt. He will primarily be hoping to end their anxieties that we will attempt to undermine their influence through the destruction of the democratic system. Almirante will point out that we support democracy and the right to a vote, and explain that we only wish to preserve the empire and the livelihood of her subjects. And while many may be afraid of him getting too big for his britches, he will let them rest easy when he announces that he has no plans to become anything other than Prime Minister."

ita_preserve_fascist_structures_desc:0 "There are a good many older people in Italy who look back on Mussolini's reign with a certain nostalgia, and many dream to return to those good old days. This is evident by the buttons and ribbons worn in the retirement homes, the continued printing of old fascist posters, and of course the fact that every elderly person will ramble about their love of Mussolini for hours if given even the slightest chance. While we can't turn back the clock, we can do them a small favor in keeping many of the outdated institutions and organizations that have persisted into this era from being erased. Even though liberals have been gunning for these wastes of time and money, we are able to see the vale in preserving a part of our proud history, and many of our parents will see it too. Even if these structures provide no benefit, it is worth it to appease the generation that brought us to where we are now and who we will be ever grateful towards."

ita_venerate_king_desc:0 "There is only one man alive who has been loved by the Italian people more than Benito Mussolini, and it is King Umberto himself, who has reigned our nation as a relatively apolitical ruler. However, he has performed a small role in democratizing Italy as one of the official executives of the nation. As such, it would only make sense for us to highlight the king as the one to have brought upon elections rather than the radical Ciano, who could potentially serve as a symbol for our opponents. After all, we are in control and we cannot simply allow ideologically opposed people to capture the hearts of our constituents, no matter how much they truly impacted Italy."

ita_a_catholic_nation:0 "A Catholic Nation"
ita_a_catholic_nation_desc:0 "The Lateran Treaty of 1929, signed by Mussolini, formalized the relationships between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy. The treaty included the famous Concordat, a formal agreement in which, among other things, Italy proclaimed the Catholic Church as the guiding moral body for the state. While religion and state are still separate, it is certainly a political play to gain Catholic votes. Almirante and the representatives of the Holy See have however decided to create a second Concordat, in which the Italian state will formalize its intent to safeguard and help the Church as an institution. Little will change in reality, but many Catholics look towards us with favor as having the Church firmly on our side will certainly help sway more voters towards us, and help us cement our hold on the country."

Fascism made our country great, it made our country prosperous, and seeing it slandered by media and so-called "intellectuals" is simply saddening for any upstanding Italian citizen. Even the very democratic laws we live by today are a gift that came from Ciano, from the wisdom of the Duce. To celebrate Italy's fascist heritage, Almirante has decided to speak out from the historic balcony at Palazzo Venezia in Rome, from where Mussolini and Ciano delivered their speeches. This time the crowd will be smaller, mostly made up of Blocchi Nazionali voters, but it will serve as a callback to the glorious times of the fascist era."

ita_almirante_promises_order:0 "Almirante Promises Order!"
ita_almirante_promises_order_desc:0 "Apparently not all of Italy has warmed up to the new government controlled by the Blocchi Nazionali, with many taking to the streets to protest us and our policies. These ignorant rabble rousers may be little more than an annoyance, but their mere existence makes us appear weak and unable to control our own people. This must come to a stop, not with tanks and soldiers like the villains that they think we are, but by using our voice to call for order, in true democratic fashion. Giorgio Almirante is of course our man, and in response to these agitators he will make a speech to the country denouncing them and calling for unity. Our hope is that he will be successful, and that these protests will simmer down with a little bit of pressure. After all, simply sending in the military or arresting them would only give them more cause to rise up, fulfilling the prophecy they created in spite of us."

## FUCK THE BN, COUP TIME ##

ITA_Giovanni_De_Lorenzo_DESC:0 "Giovanni De Lorenzo's rise to power shocked many in Italy, but it was far less sudden than one might expect. Born into a family with a long military tradition, De Lorenzo fought with distinction in World War Two before entering the SIM, Servizio Informazioni Militari - the Italian military intelligence service. There, he demonstrated an incredible talent at his job, organizing counterinsurgency and intelligence operations across the Empire - eventually, he was noticed by Ciano, and soon the young general was finally promoted as head of the SIM.\n\nThen, De Lorenzo's true work began. Reorganizing the SIM into an efficient and secretive machine, De Lorenzo did Ciano's dirty work - gathering intel, isolating and destroying political enemies, containing OVRA and other fascist organizations - and playing a key role in Ciano's projects of dismantling fascism, all far from the public eye. With Ciano about to step down, the Duce issued one final order: the Piano Solo. Designed to ensure a quick coup and the installment of an emergency government should Italian democracy enter crisis, the Piano was activated as soon as an attempt to reinstitute fascism was made.\n\nNow, with the King's approval, general De Lorenzo has been named Prime Minister, leading an appointed cabinet tasked with protecting Italian democracy. Saving Italy from herself will require some sacrifices - eliminating hardliners and extremists, restricting freedoms and expanding the armed forces' powers are small prices to pay to ensure that Ciano's vision is realized. Democracy is a word that has many meanings - and in De Lorenzo's mind, democracy must ensure that the many threats of fascism, socialism, and subversion are stamped out, and the people of Italy is united in their devotion to the Fatherland and to the King."

# The Piano Solo knows many people's connections, opening up these files will help lead to tracking and curbing radicalism
lorenzo.1.t:0 "Knowledge is Power"
lorenzo.1.d:0 "Giovanni di Lorenzo knew a lot of things about a lot of people. And this would be the basis for Piano Solo, for to know certain things about people's connections was to wield tremendous power over them. Curbing radicalism, at the end of the day, was simply about unravelling these connections and blackmailing whoever needed to be blackmailed to learn more. And once a solid picture was built, Lorenzo would know exactly which pressure points to use to bring a whole edifice of conspiracy and rebellion crumbling to the ground. Perhaps Italy would never know the debt she owed to men like him, or perhaps it would learn of them and look the other way. It did not matter, for the cause was correct. Many would like to think stability is built on the consent of the ruled, but consent was overrated. Fear worked just as well."
lorenzo.1.a:0 "He would know, and he would watch."

# Piano Solo officializes its actions, moves out for a "greater good" to curb radicalism
lorenzo.2.t:0 "An Air of Formality"
lorenzo.2.d:0 "To know was well and good, but it was not enough. In order for Piano Solo to achieve its objectives, it would need an air of formality and sufficient official authority to act without being questioned. Of course, everyone involved understood that it would not do to refer to the full extent of the plan out in the open. This would only invite accusations of authoritarianism and subversion. All Lorenzo needed was some measure of official approval, of nods from the right people, and of eyes shut where they needed to be. He also needed men to work with, and this an official status would provide. Then, with the assurance provided to the SIM, he could begin to construct his web."
lorenzo.2.a:0 "Italy would owe them a great debt."

# Sezione I, connections with other governments, the Piano Solo cannot work alone!
lorenzo.3.t:0 "Approach the Foreign Governments"
lorenzo.3.d:0 "The Piano Solo cannot work alone. The SIM needed foreign assistance, Lorenzo knew, and he was willing to make such contacts as necessary with the delicacy and secrecy that the situation required. He was not a diplomatic expert by any means, but was informed that the United States of America and Japan had a common interest in the stability of the Kingdom of Italy. They would certainly not hesitate to help Rome curb radicalism and fight subversive activity, whatever it took..."
lorenzo.3.a:0 "Our foreign friends will help us."

# For USA, the SIM is wondering if they can trade information you have on Italians (only yes, its to help their democracy)
lorenzo.4.t:0 "A Quiet Request"
lorenzo.4.d:0 "We have been approached, in a manner typical of a delicate request, by the Italian government (or men acting on behalf of it). The Servizio Informazioni Militare, Rome's military intelligence body, has asked to trade information we possess on Italian nationals in return for information they have on American citizens. Naturally we have approved the request, and informed them we would be open to cooperate in future in the interest of European stability and anti-subversive intelligence."
lorenzo.4.a:0 "This will help build Italian democracy."

lorenzo.5.t:0 "A Subtle Request"
lorenzo.5.d:0 "With a subtlety not entirely typical of the Italians, the Servizio Informazioni Militare, Rome's military intelligence service, has approached us to request an information exchange. In return for information we possess on certain Italian citizens, they will give us useful information on the whereabouts and activities of Japanese in which we already have an interest. Naturally we have approved the trade, and look forward to further collaboration that will help stabilise and strengthen the Italian state."
lorenzo.5.a:0 "This will help build the Italian nation."

# Watchful eyes on those in industrial positions, watching out for left folks
lorenzo.6.t:0 "Watching Industry"
lorenzo.6.d:0 "Lorenzo's training and acquired skills allowed him to see things others did not. Where simple men would look at an industry boardroom or factory line and see people doing their job, Lorenzo could make out a potential subversive from a while away. The socialist menace had never really been washed out of Italian industry, even with decades of Fascist rule, and Lorenzo knew that under the surface lurked a beast waiting to tear the foundation of the economy in two. It was for this reason that industry had to be watched, lists of leftist elements made, and plans for dealing with subversion drawn up."
lorenzo.6.a:0 "The wheel would keep turning."

# Sezione III, controlling culture, extremism is rooted in one's mind from others, blame media, we're controlling it now
lorenzo.7.t:0 "Controlling Culture"
lorenzo.7.d:0 "Extremism is not borne out of thin air, out of some combination of individual pathology and external circumstances. Extremism is rather something of a virus, and it spreads above all through culture, which has been far too lenient on subversive thought for far too long. Lorenzo understood that to control a culture was to control a country, and if the media was not willing to police itself, then it would have to be controlled by someone willing to do so. To accept anything less would be to leave the germ of extremism intact, with inevitable results to follow."
lorenzo.7.a:0 "Control what they watch and hear."

# holy shit bro you just anthrax someone because they didnt agree with your take over of the media, cover it up
lorenzo.8.t:0 "An Unfortunate Accident"
lorenzo.8.d:0 "An incident has taken place which could potentially harm the execution of Piano Solo should it become public knowledge. A dissident editor, who had voiced very negative views of the SIM's cooperation with the media, has become infected with anthrax. Naturally to imply any involvement from any actor linked to Piano Solo is an absurd provocation, designed by subversive elements to destabilise the Italian social order. Nevertheless, we must now cooperate with the media further to ensure that the story does not spread. Due to the fear unfortunately sparked by the incident, it should not be very difficult to make them see our way."
lorenzo.8.a:0 "These things happen."

# Sezione VII, putting away troublemakers, extremists are planned to magically disappear
lorenzo.9.t:0 "Preparations for a magic trick"
lorenzo.9.d:0 "Setting up a magic trick takes patience, timing and skill. We possess all of these things in abundance. Though reports about who is involved cannot be confirmed, suffice to say that some troublemakers living in Italy today will not be here tomorrow. They will not die, nor will they turn up in a jail cell. They will simply disappear.\n\nA magic trick, without an audience or applause."
lorenzo.9.a:0 "Only shadows."

# Disappearances, very eerie tone, "some people were just never there" extremists take a huge hit
lorenzo.10.t:0 "Le Scomparse"
lorenzo.10.d:0 "Extremism in Italy has suffered a setback it will not recover from. A number of people have disappeared; or rather, it would be more accurate to say that they were never there. Figures appearing in doorways, snatches of screams, and scuffles in the middle of the night have all been rumoured, but none of these rumours has been proven. The only thing that is known is that the disappeared will not be coming back, and Italy is the better for it."
lorenzo.10.a:0 "Gone."

# The army. Borghese has always been keen on removing those extremists, we'll plan to turn some stuff over to him
lorenzo.11.t:0 "Dealing with the Army"
lorenzo.11.d:0 "Extremism lurks everywhere; the armed forces are not an exception. Luckily for us our friend in the Army, Borghese, has always been dedicated to rooting out subversion wherever it stems. He shall not hesitate to do so when it concerns the men under his command. Whilst we could act to quell extremism in the Army ourselves, it would be better to turn over the information we possess to Borghese, who will do the job better than we could. For after all, why make a job complicated when the solution is so simple?"
lorenzo.11.a:0 "Discipline will be maintained."

# Connections to corporate people, those behind the Piano Solo have a lot of connections, but the corporate ones are the most beneficial to us currently, funds
lorenzo.12.t:0 "Our Friends in Finance"
lorenzo.12.d:0 "Some of the more paranoid types among the subversives we've encountered in the country possess a strange image of the workings of power: that there is some cabal of corporate giants, politicians and secret service heads who secretly rule Italy. The world is much more complicated than that, of course, and our friends in finance are motivated by nothing more than securing stability and prosperity for all. Those wanting Piano Solo to succeed have connections all across the spectrum, but the finance types are the most beneficial in terms of funding. These relationships will have to be kept smooth, and mutually beneficial, so that the friendship we have built in serving Italy will last."
lorenzo.12.a:0 "Such friendship is a fine thing."

# Merzagora talks about how the Piano Solo was cruel, and as the new face of it, a return to normalcy will be possible!
lorenzo.13.t:0 "Assurances of Normality"
lorenzo.13.d:0 "Cesare Merzagora, one of our many faithful supporters in the political class, has been given a difficult task. With the unfortunate demise of the newspaper editor some days ago and some of the actions taken to implement Piano Solo, some of the plan's backers have voiced concern that the measures taken go too far. Merzagora's job is to assure the doubters that whilst such events may have seemed cruel or destabilising, the way forward for Piano Solo is far more benign. They need only trust in his word, and let the structures put in place do their job. More complaints and doubts, however, will not help anyone."
lorenzo.13.a:0 "All of this is for Italy, after all!"

# Speaking to the monarchist party, "hey, yall associated with radical fascists, don't do that, we have faith in you, especially because we know a lot of people in you higher ups."
lorenzo.14.t:0 "Speaking with the Monarchists"
lorenzo.14.d:0 "In fulfilling the political objectives of Piano Solo, we have sought out and spoken to the Monarchists taking part in Italy's democratic life. During such contacts, made all too easy by our links to the highest ranks of the Monarchist faction, we expressed our faith in the goodwill of the group. We also expressed disappointment at the group's association with certain radical elements wishing for a restoration of Fascism. These elements are not productive, we insisted, and there is no space for them in Italian politics. We are certain that these talks will bear fruit."
lorenzo.14.a:0 "They will listen."

# Speaking to the socialist party "Hey PDSI, you openly associated with communists, fuck off, we have documents on a lot of you, dont be radical."
lorenzo.15.t:0 "Speaking with the Socialists"
lorenzo.15.d:0 "We have sought out and met with the PSDI, in the best interest of fulfilling Piano Solo. During such contacts, made simple by our knowledge of the group's most intricate maneuvers, we frankly stated our disapproval of their association with communist elements. This is all the more unfortunate, we explained, because we of course possess masses of documentation on the threat of radicalism within the leftist camp. Should such radicalism not be expunged, this would be profoundly regrettable for everyone involved, and could lead to the socialists not being able to participate in Italian democracy any further. We are certain that these words were not said to the leftists in vain."
lorenzo.15.a:0 "They will understand."

# Speaking to the centrists "Y'all do a good job at not being radical, but just know, we have our eyes everywhere. Good luck in the next election!" theyre intimidation them
lorenzo.16.t:0 "Speaking with the Centrists"
lorenzo.16.d:0 "We have spoken to the Christian Democrats and the constellation of factions making up the democratic centre, in order to further our desire for stability and prosperity in Italy. During these discussions, made simple by our understanding of the motivations of the centrist cliques, we congratulated them on staying the middle course and popularising moderate politics among the Italian electorate. Whilst we can only wish them the best of luck for the upcoming elections, we emphasised, the leaders of DC must ensure that radicalism never finds the opportunity to sprout among their grouping. Should this ever occur, besides, we would know immediately, as we have made it our business to know these things. We are certain that the centrists will take our words to heart."
lorenzo.16.a:0 "They will agree."




## Italy election loc


itaelections66.1.t:0 "The Start of the Campaign"
itaelections66.1.desc:0 "The Italian people were used to turning on their TVs in the evening and, finally relaxing after a long day of work, watch the amenities that RAI, the state television, usually offered. Exotic documentaries on the remote corners of the empire, thrilling love dramas, and gossip about celebrities and socialites. But this evening, they saw something they had never seen before on TV - a political debate.\n\nIn a modestly arranged television studio in Rome, three men sat on uncomfortable looking plastic chairs, exchanging fulminating looks as a journalist interrogated them on various topics. Answering to a question on his economic program, Aldo Moro, with a slow but determined voice, said - "...we do not say that the state should control all economic activities, but the state, in the complexity of its powers, should not preclude individual initiatives, but it should coordinate, discipline and orient them..."\n\nQuestioned on the more openly socialist points of his agenda, Pietro Nenni, with a fiery and uncompromising tone, answered - "I shall be blunt, socialism is nothing more than to bring forward those who were born in the back ranks!". Finally, Giorgio Almirante, asked about his opinions on fascism and democracy, answered with a sly smile - "I was born and raised under fascism, and I believed in it so much that I excused or ignored all its mistakes. That is my past, our past - we cannot deny it. We should strive to let its valid aspects stay alive." As families and households around Italy had their eyes fixated on their TV screens, everyone, even the children who could barely understand what those three old man suits were talking about, instinctively knew that this was merely the start of something far bigger."
itaelections66.1.a:0 "Moro seems the most reasonable."
itaelections66.1.b:0 "Nenni is right!"
itaelections66.1.c:0 "Almirante's got a point..."

itaelections66.2.t:0 "Women in Politics"
italelection66.2.desc:0 "In a quickly changing world, social roles and convention are often revealed to be much less eternal or unchangeable than they seem. With the recent wave of liberalization, many of the most active members of the new Italian parties and political associations belong to the gentle sex - and their political affiliation may be surprising. Carla De Paoli, director of one of the most widespread BN newspapers, The Italian, has published a heartfelt appeal to Italian women - to reject the siren calls of the rising feminist movement, and rediscover the profundity of the their traditional role as queens of the households and keepers of the hearth.\n\nStill, by far the louder voices come from the left. Lina Merlin, a prominent member of the PSI and a candidate for parliament in the FD, has become the face of the Italian feminist movement, campaigning in favour of egalitarian laws in matters of divorce and inheritance, the full abolition of state-ran brothels, and founding the Unione Difesa della Donna, a lobbying organization reuniting numerous pro-feminist organizations across the country.\n\nThe centre's answer was not long awaited. In a heartfelt speech before a DC rally, Tina Anselmi, a rising star of the Catholic movement, has stressed the need for Italian women to advance alongside the rest of the country, advocating for equal opportunities on the workplace - with fairer wages, more social security, and better schooling directed at women in the rural parts of the country. As many Italian women and girls feel that for the first time they've been given a voice, now the world of politics wonders how they will use it."

itaelections66.2.a:0 "The traditional family must be preserved."
itaelections66.2.b:0 "We must struggle for women's liberation!"
itaelections66.2.c:0 "Equal opportunities benefit not just women, but all of Italy."

itaelections66.3.t:0 "Students in Politics"
itaelections66.3.desc:0 "The young generations have always been politically active in Italy, and as fascism attempted to channel the energy of youth into the Gruppi Universitari Fascisti and similar organizations, Italian university have a tradition of being involved in the country's political life. Predictably, many Italian youngsters were attracted by the promises of liberalization of culture and academia offered by the left, and with Marxist and socialist literature spreading like wildfire, organizations like the Italian Socialist Youth Federation, the Movimento Studentesco, and a plethora of others are swelling their ranks at an impressive pace, and the first rivalries between different strands of socialist and communist ideologues are already starting.\n\nTo every action, corresponds a reaction - and from the right, the reaction did come. Reforming the old GUF and other fascist era organizations, the University National Action Front or FUAN are rapidly gathering under its aegis all the right wing students of Italian universities. Slowly but surely, the influence of the far right on the youth is showing in unexpected ways - in Milano, a sort of somewhat openly neo-fascist youth gang was formed in Piazza San Babila, near the city centre. Watched with suspicion by even the BN, the "sanbabilini" are already starting to be associated with petty crimes and disturbances in the area.\n\nSomewhat unexpectedly due to the radicalism and idealism typical of youth, the centre has managed to attract a fair share of young men and women too. Azione Cattolica and other Catholic movements, which even the fascist regime couldn't touch, are now becoming more important than ever - using Catholic strongholds like the University of the Sacred Heart in Milano as their headquarters, it's hard to tell how much of their recent growth is due to genuine conviction or to opportunism on the students' part."
itaelections66.3.a:0 "The youth should engage in the struggle for Socialism."
itaelections66.3.b:0 "The right wing students are united for Italy."
itaelections66.3.c:0 "The Catholic movement shall spread far and wide."

itaelections66.4.t:0 "Minorities in Politics"
itaelections66.4.desc:0 "Italy has always been a diverse place in matters of culture and language, and the annexation of vast amounts of land in World War Two did nothing to ameliorate the issue. Now, in every corner of the country, minority populations are celebrating the return of democracy as the end of fascist oppression, that consistently denied them the right to speak their language and practice their culture. En masse, numerous upstart politicians from South Tyrol to Libya are joining the ranks of FD - and new organizations like Val d'Aosta's Union Valdôtaine, led by Séverin Caveri, and Malta' Partit Laburista, led by Dom Mintoff are allying with the leftist coalition, hoping to secure equal rights and government aid for their communities and regions, often neglected by the fascist regime.\n\nA prominent strand of movements, however, often wary of leftism espoused by FD, have begun gravitating towards DC instead. The most prominent of these are the Südtiroler Volkspartei, led by Silvius Magnago, and the Seznam Slovanov led by Engelbert Besednjak - representing the German and Slavic communities in South Tyrol and the Italian eastern marches respectively. Focusing on economic and administrative autonomy, they often represent the conservative and liberal minded upper and middle classes of their respective regions.\n\nOf course, the Italian right wing immediately saw the various minority movements as a major threat. The Blocchi Nazionali are already launching propaganda campaigns aimed at Italian communities in regions like Trieste, Dalmatia and Libya, decrying the encroachment of minorities against the rights of Italians. Throwing fuel on the fires of the somewhat tense ethnic relations, the BN have begun to sway several Italian communities on their side, and they might have strong electoral results in these frontier regions."
itaelections66.4.a:0 "The peoples of Italy march together for equality!"
itaelections66.4.b:0 "The communities of Italian minorities deserve autonomy."
itaelections66.4.c:0 "These rabble should learn their place."

itaelections66.5.t:0 "The Military in Politics"
itaelections66.5.desc:0 "The Italian military forces have always had a complicated relationship with politics, its ties to government shifting and changing with the times. As Italy is on the path to the elections, many prominent military figures, especially those in the upper brass, have expressed favour for the BN - a party portrayed by propaganda as the great defender of Italian greatness against the rising tide of leftism and foreign interference. The Blocchi Nazionali are spending a great deal of its campaign efforts towards swaying the military electorate and key people to its side, and so far it seems like their efforts are paying off.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that all of the military is in favour of Almirante and his group. A few among the older and more prestigious members of the Italian armed forces, including legendary general and Marshal of Italy Giovanni Messe, are openly proclaiming their support of Democrazia Cristiana. Wisened by age and experience, these veteran generals and officers are wary of the BN's hawkish rhetoric, especially after all the bloodshed of World War Two and the following conflicts that cost so many Italian lives. Proclaiming the need for the Italian army to be used as a force of peace, not war and aggression, their calls are being heard by more and more with each passing day.\n\nA somewhat similar trend has been developing among the common soldiery and younger officers. Also tired of the seemingly wanton way past governments have put the lives of Italian soldiers on the line, many among the lower ranks of the troops have begun to be attracted by the pacifist agenda sponsored by FD, calling for a gradual disengagement from many Italosphere countries and a reduction of military budget. This tendency is still relatively minor, but it might begin to have greater importance in the future."
itaelections66.5.a:0 "We must defend Italy's greatness."
itaelections66.5.b:0 "We should heed Messe's advice."
itaelections66.5.c:0 "We shall set ourselves on the road to peace."

itaelections66.6.t:0 "The Voices of the Workers"
itaelections66.6.desc:0 "The fascist dictatorship harshly repressed independent trade unions, replacing them with state-controlled organizations in which the workers had very little say. Now, as the country democratizes, new unions have risen, usually with a close alliance to one of the electoral coalitions - unsurprisingly, the FD have rapidly managed to make large headways into the working class electorate, and two major unions have now been formed - the Italian General Confederation of Labour, or CGIL, and the Italian Labour Union, or UIL, both supportive of FD. Already gathering a large amount of supporters, CGIL and UIL seem poised to be FD's first line in their struggle for workers' rights.\n\nHowever, that is not to say that the working class has rallied under the socialist banner. The other major trade union in the country, the Italian Confederation of Workers' Unions or CISL, is openly pro-DC, and has managed to gather strong support among the more Catholic minded strata of the working classes. Its bureaucracy and inner workings closely tied to Democrazia Cristiana, CISL enjoys the Church's support and has begun to campaign for resolving the trouble of the working class through dialogue and mutual understanding, letting labour and capital work together for a brighter future.\n\nFinally, there are also a few minor trade unions, much smaller in size, controlled by the BN - most notably CISNAL, or Italian Confederation of National Workers' Unions. Decidedly controlled by the BN, CISNAL doesn't seem to have gathered much following among the Italian workers - indeed, much of the BN's platform regarding this issue has had decidedly anti-union tones, painting CGIL, CISL and UIL as dangerous dens of bolsheviks and as slackers who do not wish to work."

itaelections66.6.a:0 "Workers of Italy, unite!"
itaelections66.6.b:0 "Catholic doctrine shall enlighten the country's economy."
itaelections66.6.c:0 "We can't trust the unions!"

itaelections66.7.t:0 "The Church's Involvement"
itaelections66.7.desc:0 "In a country where the overwhelming majority of the population is Catholic, it should be no surprise that the Church holds a great deal of political influence - this is even more true in Italy's case, as the Holy See itself finds its home in Vatican City, a microstate surrounded by the Italian capital. Predictably, the Church has enjoyed a great relationship with Democrazia Cristiana, the only openly Catholic major party and one which draws its roots into the many Catholic organizations the fascist regime could never quite suppress. Much like the Church itself, DC too oscillates between progressivism and conservatism, as the party has adopted the social teachings of the Church and turned them into a political platform.\n\nDespite the Church's overwhelming support of DC, there are a few dissident members of the clergy that have different ideas. Mostly coming from the lower ranks of the ecclesial hierarchy, priests in major cities of Italy, often those from the most socially and economically downtrodden areas, are more or less openly declaring their support for FD hoping that they will help resolve the many issues of the poorer strata of urban Italian society. As small numbers of Catholic intellectuals also are attracted by FD, it seems like Italian Catholicism might be more red than one could expect.\n\nHowever, the forces of reaction and conservatism are still strong in the Church. In many rural parts of Italy, the local parishes and churches are not merely places of contemplation and worship, but also a focal point of virulent anti-Communist propaganda. Conservatives in the Church, in both the upper and lower ranks, are often wary of DC's reformism and openness to dialogue with FD, and the more national conservative minded areas Blocchi Nazionali are exploiting this wave of reactionary resurgence."

itaelections66.7.a:0 "The Church shall support the Party of Catholics!"
itaelections66.7.b:0 "Jesus was the first socialist!"
itaelections66.7.c:0 "In the name of God, these bolsheviks must be stopped!"

itaelections66.8.t:0 "Minor Parties"
itaelections66.8.desc:0 "While the three major competitors are locked in a deadly race as the elections approach, other, minor parties are also being formed and running their own campaign, hoping to snag a few percentage points of the Italian electorate. However, given Italy's multiparty system, even a tiny party might be able to tip the scales of the political system. One such party is the Italian Liberal Party, or PLI, led by Giovanni Malagodi. A decidedly pro business party, enjoying close tied to Confindustria and other organizations that represent the Italian industrial and economic aristocracy, the PLI has a largely conservative and centre-right platform - and, out of a shared distaste for FD's communism and mistrust for DC's progressive policies, might be drawn to support the BN.\n\nAnother minor Italian party of some importance is the Italian Republican Party, or PRI, led by Ugo La Malfa. A party with an ancient and noble tradition, including several important names of Italian anti-fascists, the PRI calls back to Mazzini's vision for an Italian state - campaigning with a decidedly reformist and progressive platform, balancing liberalism, rejection of communism, and civic nationalism, the PRI has been drawn towards DC, creating a working relationship with the Catholic party out of overall similar agendas.\n\nFinally, a small but certainly very loud party is the Radical Party, led by Marco Pannella. A strongly liberal and pro-civil rights party, loudly campaigning for women's emancipation, anti-racism, homosexual rights, pro-choice legislation and other hot themes of political debates, the Radicals have been drawn towards the FD because it's the only major political force willing to entertain them on such themes - even if, ironically, the Radicals are a staunchly pro free market and economically liberal party."

itaelections66.8.a:0 "We must protect the interests of Italian business!"
itaelections66.8.b:0 "Mazzini's ideals shall guide Italy."
itaelections66.8.c:0 "The people deserve freedom!"

itaelections66.9.t:0 "The Eve of the Election"
itaelections66.9.desc:0 "As the date scheduled for the election approaches closer and closer, bookmakers and analysts, both Italian and international, are drawing their conclusive predictions regarding the new face of Italian politics. The most probable winner, according to early analysis, is the centrist Democrazia Cristiana - a party born out of long-standing Catholic organizations which the fascist regime could never fully dislodge due to their deep ties to the Church, DC is a decidedly centrist party, finding a wide support base among the middle classes, many Italian Catholics, and political moderates.\n\nClosely behind in electoral projections is the coalition known as Fronte Democratico, a leftist big tent gathering numerous organizations to the left of DC. Chiefly formed out of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and the Italian Social Democratic Party (PSDI), FD is the direct continuation of anti-fascist exile and underground organizations, which although greatly weakened by the regime, never stopped being active. The FD receives a lot of its support from the lower classes of society, mainly workers and farmers, as well as students and the Italian youth.\n\nFinally, the underdog of the race are the Blocchi Nazionali, a right wing coalition. Largely formed out of remnants of the PNF, the BN oscillate between conservatism, nationalism, and outright fascist rhetoric. A strongly divided movement kept together by the charisma of its leader, Giorgio Almirante, the BN enjoy support from traditionalist minded regions of rural Italy, former fascist bureaucrats and politicians, as well as a small but very vocal minority of young fascist students."

itaelections66.9.a:0 "DC! Vote DC!"
itaelections66.9.b:0 "Comrade, vote for the FD!"
itaelections66.9.c:0 "If you don't intend to vote for the BN, we have ways to change your mind..."

itaelections66.10.t:0 "Victory for Democrazia Cristiana!"
itaelections66.10.desc:0 "The most widely predicted outcome for the elections has come to realization - Democrazia Cristiana has gathered enough votes to ensure a strong parliamentary majority, with Fronte Democratico a close second. As celebrations are already underway in the many circles and associations affiliated with the party, a smiling king Umberto II has entrusted the candidate of DC, former law professor Aldo Moro, with the position of prime minister of the Kingdom of Italy, asking him to form a cabinet as soon as possible.\n\nIn spite of the DC victory, some internal issues are still to be resolved. The broad voting base of DC inevitably means that numerous different currents have formed inside the party, ranging from moderates and conservatives, tied to the world of the business, finance, and the Church itself, to a much more progressive wing represented chiefly by Moro himself and by his right hand man and ally, Amintore Fanfani. Several issues divide the party, mainly regarding the possibility of a some sort of accomodation or alliance with the Fronte Democratico.\n\nDespite the still somewhat uncertain details of the future Moro government, Italian society has reacted with optimism to the recent DC victory. Confindustria, the Italian confederation of businesses, has expressed their hope that DC will be able to lead to increased prosperity for Italy and its many industries, while everywhere in the country many wonder if DC will be able to keep its promises of improved economic conditions and wages. With all these questions still open, Italy has now entered a new phase of its history - one that is hopefully going to be characterized by peace and democracy."

itaelections66.10.a:0 "Viva la DC!"

itaelections66.11.t:0 "Victory for Fronte Democratico!"
itaelections66.11.desc:0 "The first Italian elections after the end of fascism have resulted in a surprising outcome - by a narrow margin, Fronte Democratico, the left wing coalition, has managed to secure a parliamentary majority. As mass celebrations are taking place, involving Italian students and workers who supported the left, a formal king Umberto has received Pietro Nenni at the Quirinale royal palace, entrusting him with the position of prime minister of the Kingdom of Italy and tasking him with forming a cabinet as soon as possible.\n\nThe victory for FD seems to have taken the coalition itself by surprise, and many are worried that the narrow majority they hold in Parliament, combined with the somewhat shaky nature of the electoral alliance, might spell an early doom for the hopeful leftist group. A congress of the Italian Socialist Party, the dominant force in FD and the party led by Nenni himself, has already been called to find a strategy to solidify the coalition's hold on Parliament. A rising voice inside the party, that of respected politician Giuseppe Saragat, head of the Italian Social Democratic Party, is pushing for an alliance with Democrazia Cristiana, Italy's largest party and main opposition group to FD.\n\nOpposition to Saragat inside FD mainly comes from the leftmost ranks of the PSI, which is rallying around the charismatic Enrico Berlinguer. With various sections of the party threatening to split themselves from FD if their demands aren't met, it is hard to predict what Nenni's tenure as prime minister will look like, but one thing is certain - the Blocchi Nazionali and their affiliated associations have sworn fierce opposition to FD, and have proclaimed their willingness to combat their new government in Parliament and everywhere in Italy. As the Italian people look towards the future with uncertainty, Italy has entered a new phase of its history, the outcome of which is yet to be written."

itaelections66.12.t:0 "Victory for the Blocchi Nazionali!"
itaelections66.12.desc:0 "In a completely unexpected turn of events, the first elections in Italian history after fascism have been won by an electoral force closely tied to the former regime - the Blocchi Nazionali. As a somber faced king Umberto II has called Giorgio Almirante, leader of the coalition to the Quirinale in order to entrust him with forming a new government, riots are already taking place in several Italian cities as celebrating rallies organized by the BN are being attacked by angry leftist crowds.\n\nThe Blocchi Nazionali themselves seem to be quite unprepared for this development, and it seems like the coalition is already descending into an identity crisis. While many members of BN are national conservatives, tied to the monarchical institution and the upper spheres of Italian government and economy, a large party of the BN is composed of diehard fascists, most of them coming straight from the higher ranks of the dissolved PNF - chief among them, Almirante himself, leader of the coalition and of the Italian Social Movement, the BN's major party.\n\nAs the Italian streets are already resounding with cries about another fascist takeover of government, Almirante and his men will have to soon figure out how to defuse the inevitable crisis. Rising voices within the BN and the MSI himself, chief of them old statesman and grey eminence of the coalition Augusto De Marsanich, are begging Almirante to renounce its overtly fascist rhetoric and instead find an accomodation with the new institutions, but on the other side a new generation of radical young fascists, such Pino Rauti, are growing more and more influential in the party, and displaying their opposition to any sort of compromise. Still, one thing is certain - Italy has entered a new phase of its history, but it might be not so different from the last one."
