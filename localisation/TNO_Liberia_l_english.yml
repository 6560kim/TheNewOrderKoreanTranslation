 POLITICS_WILLIAM_TUBMAN_DESC:0 "There are many things one can call William Tubman. Corrupt is one of them. Controversial is another. A fool is not one.\n\nBorn into both a military and political family in 1895, William followed in his father's footsteps by running and winning a senate seat in 1923, becoming the youngest senator in Liberian history. From there, his political star only rose further, becoming President in 1942 as the World War raged around Liberia. No sooner had Tubman entered the office than order collapsed in West Africa, and a refugee crisis that had never been seen in African history threatened to engulf the tiny nation. However, Tubman steered the ship of state through the rough seas of the postwar order, aided by his friends in the OFN.\n\nAs time went on, though, Tubman grew more authoritarian and more isolationist, distancing himself from the OFN in favor of blissful neutrality. In today's Liberia, nobody challenges Tubman. This is not because there is no opposition to Tubman. Rather, it is because any who dare to challenge him are either too weak to command the opposition vote, corrupt enough to take the "gifts" from Tubman's administration and coincidentally end their run, or die in unfortunate accidents if they refuse the money.\n\nToday's Liberia is prosperous, peaceful, and united under Tubman. Undoubtedly the richest state in West Africa, Liberia commands a heavy trade presence in the Gold Coast. After all, despite all the differences of the Liberian people, Tubman is the father of modern Liberia. Of course, this system depends on Tubman's continued health, and if- or rather when- he finally passes on, the Liberian golden age may come crashing down on top of the Liberian people's heads."
