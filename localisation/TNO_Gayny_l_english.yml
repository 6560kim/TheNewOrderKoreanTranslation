 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_ANTIPIN_DESC:0 "Mikhail Ivanovich Antipin was originally a humble farmer from Chelyabinsk, one who focused more on day-to-day survival instead of education or philosophical matters. When duty - and the draft - called, he ended up in the infantry as a machine gunner, fighting mostly on the Ukrainian front. He was a rather prolific soldier, even being considered for the Hero of the Soviet Union award at one point. He never was properly honored, however, because the government collapsed shortly after. His brigade fell to infighting, and he fled with nothing but the clothes on his back.\n\nAfter wandering through the wilderness for over a month, Antipin came upon the town of Gayny, where a local priest took him in and nursed him back to health. In the meantime, Antipin had something of a religious awakening, realizing that all these terrible tragedies that shook Russia - the incompetence of the Tsars, the Germans, the October Revolution, the tyranny of the Soviets, the famines, the Germans once more - were not happenstance, but punishments. The people of Russia had forsaken the Lord, so He brought retribution upon them for their sins.\n\nThis revelation brought a new purpose to Antipin's life. He rallied men from Gayny and the surrounding villages of the Gayny District beneath the banner of what they called the "Order of Saint George", promising to "impale the dragon of atheism upon the lance of truth." The Order is fairly small, but they provide stability and spiritual encouragement for the people of the district, and have proven rather effective at keeping the madmen and heathens surrounding them at bay. Grand Master Mikhail only kneels before God and refuses to suborn the Order to any mortal ruler, but if he discovers a leader who he finds to be sufficiently pious, he will gladly pledge himself and his men to its cause."

 POLITICS_YAKOV_PENTELEEV_DESC:0 "Yakov Elizarovich Panteleyev is a veteran of more wars than most. Born in a village of Udmurtia, he was a farmer until he was drafted into the Red Army mere days after the start of the Great Patriotic War. He bravely defended cities far from his homeland in the Idel-Ural, which earned him many medals and promotions, and fought until the Germans reached the banks of the Volga, and all hope was lost. Still a patriot at heart, Panteleyev volunteered to join a unit of ethnic Udmurts in the West Russian War, but once again, Russia faced defeat at the hands of the Wehrmacht, and from there the officer faded into obscurity.\n\nThat was, until the Anti-Communist Guard reigned supreme over northwestern Russia and authority in the Volga region collapsed. As a respected army commander, Yakov was unanimously elected by a hurriedly formed local council as the new President of the Udmurt Republic, in association with the Northern Russian Republic as a loyal ally.\n\nFor the first time, Panteleyev's people have a nation for themselves, and he would like to keep it that way."

But we, the Order of Saint George, have understood that the Salvation of Russia lies in returning to Russia's roots as a land of faith, and by reviving the Faith we will gain the favor of the Lord; and with His Favor comes the fortitude necessary to smite all enemies and reclaim Russia from the invaders and from the Red Scourge of Communism."

 ### Focus Trees ###
 #Starting Tree
 GAY_spirit_of_saint_george:0 "Spirit Of Saint George"
 GAY_spirit_of_saint_george_desc:0 "It all started when Grandmaster Mikhail, a normal soldier, made his appearance in the town of Gayny. As the days and weeks passed, the people learned of the message he had to spread, and that was the fact that Russia had been punished by God for what she had done. What was needed was a return to Christianity: no longer would the Lord be forgotten by the people. Soon, men rallied around his belief, and the Order of Saint George was founded. Just like the Saint had slain the dragon, so would the Order slay all non-believers.\n\nThe Order made itself known in the town, as it kept all enemies and bandits away from its citizens. Most civilians themselves started to subscribe to their beliefs, and the priests offered them spiritual guidance. Now, our small warlord state is in a struggle of survival, but soon, Russia will be liberated from the heathens."
 GAY_blessed_are_the_peacemakers:0 "Blessed Are The Peacekeepers"
 GAY_blessed_are_the_peacemakers_desc:0 "Ever since its arrival in the forests of West Russia and the town of Gayny, the Order of Saint George has been greatly admired by the populace which it protects from the heathens and the radicals. In fact, the people of Gayny and the nearby areas we control have shown their gratefulness to the Order with material resources.\n\nDaily, in the churches and other public spaces, many put aside their own self-serving interests, and decide to help the community, by giving donations, in money, food, or anything else. We make sure to thank our citizens for this, by paying back in the form of support for them, both practical and spiritual."
 GAY_a_light_shining_in_darkness:0 "A Light Shining In Darkness"
 GAY_a_light_shining_in_darkness_desc:0 "Before the Order's arrival, the region of Gayny was one plagued by chaos and instability, just like many others in Russia. However, when Grandmaster Mikhail and his followers set up their base in Gayny as a way to spread their faith, peace unseen since the days of the Soviet Union came to the town. The priests worked hard, day and night, to ensure that no longer would the town be ruled by bandit kings, godless communists or no one at all. And in the end, they achieved their goal, at least to some extent.\n\nStability has been brought to Gayny by the Order, and we need to maintain our efforts to keep it. That can be hard, as the Order remains an island of Christianity surrounded by enemies on all sides, but we try our best."
 GAY_the_guns_of_god:0 "The Guns Of God"
 GAY_the_guns_of_god_desc:0 "In order to continue pacifying and stabilizing the region we have established ourselves in, we need two things: guns and ammunition. Both of these are hard to get in this chaotic environment, but we must manage with what we have. In the name of God and Christianity, we will seek to find and seize weapons from wherever we can, and use them for our own purposes.\n\nOnce we have gathered enough war materiel, we may be able to continue our efforts to stabilize Gayny, and perhaps even expand it. But for now, we will praise the Lord for what aid he is giving us in the form of weaponry."
 GAY_hunt_down_the_bandits:0 "Hunt Down The Bandits"
 GAY_hunt_down_the_bandits_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts throughout the years of our existence, bandits in our territory still exist and cause a problem. They hide in the forests, and fight back against anyone who dares to try to disarm or attack them. When the opportunity presents itself, they will attack to cause harm, and gain resources for themselves. In other, even worse cases, they will launch an attack against an entire village. It is time we solved this problem.\n\nWith the equipment we have accumulated, and the resources we have collected, a concentrated attack against these enemies must take place. The army of the Order will enter the forests and the mountains, and fight the bandits wherever they are. Should this offensive be successful, our hold on the area will become much more powerful."
 GAY_hunt_down_the_bandits_tt:0 "We will strike down the heathen bandits plaguing the faithful!\n"
 GAY_squirrels_nest_fortress:0 "Squirrel's Nest Fortress"
 GAY_squirrels_nest_fortress_desc:0 "In the Komi-Permyak language, of the native people who once used to roam these lands and still survive in small numbers, "Gayna" means "Squirrel's Nest". Perhaps it is the position of this area, or its environment and its surroundings, that gave it this unique name, but one thing is for sure: the Order of Saint George has made the Squirrel's Nest into an impenetrable fortress, or at least it aims to.\n\nAs the only stronghold of Orthodoxy in Russia, it is the Order's duty to keep the town under its protection, and never give it up no matter what. The construction of fortifications must continue, using the available resources, to ensure that Gayny is safe from outside invaders, and that the Squirrel's Nest forever remains under our rule."
 GAY_shield_of_the_faithful:0 "Shield Of The Faithful"
 GAY_shield_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "In the environment of warlordism and chaos that has dominated the region the Order established itself in since the end of the West Russian War, normal civilians and believers of Christ can sometimes find survival and a good life difficult to achieve. What Gayny can offer, though, is protection for them. Those who believe in Christ and His teachings will be allowed to enter our lands, and enjoy a life without pain and suffering.\n\nThe Order will make sure to protect them as they are faithful, and all believers must be protected by our army, as per its original purpose. And they try to achieve that, which has become apparent since many have flocked to Gayny as a safe haven, which is an option as long as they are devout Christians. As for those who are not, they shall not enjoy the shield we can offer, and when the time comes, they will face the consequences."
 GAY_shepherd_the_flock:0 "Shepherd The Flock"
 GAY_shepherd_the_flock_desc:0 "Many in our poor nation have been misguided, one way or the other. Some decided to take a different course in their beliefs on their own, while others were swayed and pressured by their surroundings to adopt them. What matters now, though, is that in this small corner of Russia, we must teach those we protect, and teach them the truth.\n\nOrthodox Christianity is the only way to save the nation and to move forward, and through the Order we will spread this message. Just like Jesus did almost two millennia ago and as the Bible says, the priests of the Order shall become Good Shepherds, taking care of the people and cultivating them. Only through this method will the citizens of Gayny learn the true ways of Christianity."
 GAY_the_question_of_recruitment:0 "The Question Of Recruitment"
 GAY_the_question_of_recruitment_desc:0 "As much as we seek to spread the message of God and Christianity, we have to face the physical and practical problems which have appeared, setting hurdles to our ambitions to reclaim our nation in the name of Orthodoxy. One of these is manpower. As we have been forced to retreat in a small pocket of land by all our enemies, the monarchists, the communists, and the fascists, there are few resources to use. Most importantly, our town only has a few thousand men that can be recruited to join the army, and fight against bandits and other enemies.\n\nEvery day, the leadership of the Order struggles to find solutions for this problem, which keeps getting a bit more dire as the weeks and the months pass. At some point, a final way to resolve this issue will have to be found."
 GAY_makeshift_armories:0 "Makeshift Armories"
 GAY_makeshift_armories_desc:0 "The spot of West Russia we control, sandwiched between other, possibly more powerful factions, does not have much in the way of resources, as everyone knows well. However, after all these years of holding out in Gayny, the Order of Saint George has managed to adapt to the situation and survive with what it has.\n\nMilitary industry is not abundant. There were never any significant factories producing equipment near Gayny, and no attempts have been made to construct them, especially when most factories are wrecked by relentless German bombings. For that reason, we must work in the small scale. The civilians will cooperate with the Order, helping build small arsenals of weapons and ammunition, or workshops to make equipment in. It will be quite basic, but it's a start, and greater things will hopefully come in the future."
 GAY_hands_of_the_diligent:0 "Hands Of The Diligent"
 GAY_hands_of_the_diligent_desc:0 "Military industry is not the only type of industry required to make a country, or even a small city-state like us, function. As this is not the stone age, the people of Gayny have needs that can only be fulfilled through other factories, or in our case, smaller workshops and stores. Thus, if we want to enjoy a better position and more power, we need to increase our production in civilian goods as well.\n\nWe must encourage more people to open their own businesses, for pursuing profit for themselves and helping the community as a whole. The hope is that, slowly but surely, the economy of Gayny will begin to flourish, and so will the Order of St. George itself."
 GAY_the_grandmasters_decree:0 "The Grandmaster's Decree"
 GAY_the_grandmasters_decree_desc:0 "Grandmaster Mikhail Antipin, the Order's one and only leader, and its most loyal follower, often takes care to address his people, and not only make passionate and charismatic speeches regarding religion and the state, but also inform them on other every-day issues of Gayny. It seems that now, the Grandmaster has something more to share with his followers and the general population.\n\nAs the relentless German bombings from the west continue, and progress on the development of the town continues despite the hurdles it faces, there are many issues to discuss, and our leader wants to speak on the next steps of the Order as a nation. Thus, a meeting is to be held, for the citizens of Gayny to hear what he has to say."
 GAY_with_a_strong_hand:0 "With A Strong Hand"
 GAY_with_a_strong_hand_desc:0 "It has been proven to us, after years of living in the warlord era Russia has suffered through, that the only way to achieve your goals in this environment is through war and conquest. As much as the Order of Saint George would like everyone to peacefully accept the messages of Christianity, that is not possible anymore.\n\nThe people, or perhaps the governments that theoretically represent them, will need to be taught this lesson with force. The Order must slowly begin preparations, gathering arms and supplies and rallying the people. Violence and armed conflict may be the only way to bring Orthodoxy back to its rightful position in Russia, and we must accept that."
 GAY_we_stand_alone:0 "We Stand Alone"
 GAY_we_stand_alone_desc:0 "The neighbors of the Order are not friendly, nor is anyone else in the greater region Gayny lies in. Every warlord state is so absorbed by their beliefs in some ideology, no matter what that ideology is, or by their leader's lust for power, that they do not seek to follow Russia's rightful religion, nor help the Order in its goals. Thus, the only real choice that is left for us is diplomatic isolation.\n\nIt is time to end all attempts at contacting other warlords, for only we are the true representatives of the Russian nation and Christianity. We are able to reunite the country on our own, starting from Gayny, and we will do just that. Perhaps the wars of reunification will not start right now, but once we are in a good position, they will begin."
 GAY_an_outstretched_arm:0 "An Outstretched Arm"
 GAY_an_outstretched_arm_desc:0 "In our quest to liberate Russia and instate the return of Christianity, we must do everything we can to achieve our ultimate goals. Right now, as we stand, our options are limited, but there is a tempting option that could prove beneficial, and that is diplomacy. While they are not aligned with our own goals, for the most part, there are some warlord states in West Russia that could prove to be helpful to our cause, or at least not become direct enemies of the Order of Saint George.\n\nFor example, while the communists or the pseudo-fascists may not be the most sensible of allies to search for, other movements like the monarchist pocket established in Vyatka in the days of the West Russian War could be partly supportive of our cause and give us help."
 GAY_overtures_to_viatka:0 "Overtures To Vyatka"
 GAY_overtures_to_viatka_desc:0 "Vyatka is perhaps one of the few sensible warlords close to the frontiers of the Order of Saint George. Built by those who had lived in the years of the Tsar and, after all these decades, still adhered to their belief he was the rightful ruler of Russia, they seem to have forgotten their past of collaboration with the Germans. As they are supporters of the monarchy, they are also obviously faithful in Christian Orthodox religion, and claim it plays a big role in the country.\n\nThus, it may be time to see if Emperor Vladimir is truly worthy of becoming a friend of the order. A diplomatic mission will be sent to traverse the Russian lands and reach the city of Vyatka. There, they will seek closer cooperation and potential trade with the monarchists, and see if there is any potential in becoming their friends."
 GAY_champions_of_the_just:0 "Champions Of The Just"
 GAY_champions_of_the_just_desc:0 "For centuries and centuries, Christianity has dominated Eastern Europe and Russia. However, right now, followers of the Orthodox faith may face trouble wherever they go: in the German-occupied lands, in the communists remnants, and in many more places.\n\nWhen the Order of St. George was first founded, its members took an oath. They promised that, no matter where they went, they would protect Christians even if it could mean their lives. The members have kept this oath to this day, and it is our duty to continue this tradition. Gayny must remain a torch-bearer of the one true religion no matter what and, if possible, spread it to the rest of Russia as well."
 GAY_last_best_hope_of_russia:0 "Last, Best Hope Of Russia"
 GAY_last_best_hope_of_russia_desc:0 "A long time ago, the Russian Empire was the leading Christian Orthodox nation, battling other states in the name of god. However, by the passage of time, the ruling dynasty became more and more corrupt, drifting away from religion, and what followed was the Bolshevik revolution. The Reds were even worse, openly defying the Lord, and so they were shattered and destroyed. All suffering Russia has went through in the last century is a punishment from god, because the nation strayed away from Him.\n\nAs many factions have appeared in the wake of Russia's fall, the Order of Saint George was founded as well, to bring Christianity back to its place in the country. As countless other competitors for the country have proven to be incompetent and against religion, Gayny stands as Russia's last hope."
 
 ### Events ###
 GAY.1.t:0 "A Day In The Life"
 GAY.1.desc:0 "The day of Epistolary Daniil began two hours before dawn. Members of the night patrol rang their bells in the mess halls, carrying lanterns and awakening the warrior-monks. They donned the inner cassock in a few moments, and the chaplain led the Morning Prayer. It was a simple prayer, as ostentation did not endear men to divinity. All done, the chaplain divided the day's duties and administered the Communion, for it was Sunday. After that, he left the monks to pray, prepare, and dress as their tasks demanded of them. Daniil was to train, to pray, and to perform duties befitting an Epistolary. He issued a silent amen.\n\nIn a few moments, the morning patrol departed. After breakfast, Daniil was now in combat gear, leading his men through the war-games. He guessed that an Epistolary was equivalent to a sergeant, and he felt that he did well coordinating and commanding his squad in executing tasks throughout the field. A lucky shot took him out, and he watched in dismay as his fellows fell into disarray. Practice over, they would have lunch, and he spent the afternoon secluded in meditation. He was released just in time for the evening to sweep Russia, and thus dinner to be served. Bellies full, they would start to other tasks. For others, it would mean patrols or studies of saints. For Daniil, it was something else.\n\nHe opened the door to the scriptorium and lit a candle. It would reveal the inkpots and pens, pages and pages of parchment and paper, and volumes bound in jeweled and gilded leather covers. It was his home. Tonight, too, he would do his task with joy. He drew a sheet of parchment and opened a volume, and started copying. He whispered a silent prayer in his heart, and whether or not God existed, he no longer cared. The truth was that faith behooved men to great acts, and he thanked the Lord for what he was given today. At midnight, he would quit his task, and join the night prayer, before going to bed."
 GAY.1.a:0 "Just another day in the monastery."
