 ###LEADER DESCRIPTIONS###
 POLITICS_SULTAN_IBRAHIM_DESC:0 "술탄은 까마득한 옛날부터 말레이 문화의 일부였습니다. 이들의 전통적 역할은 문화적 상징, 의식적인 국가원수, 말레이 정체성의 중심이었습니다. 이 역할은 영국의 식민지배를 완전히 받아들이지 않는 사람들의 화를 달래왔습니다. 건물에서 영국 국장이 뜯겨나가고 욱일기가 내걸렸을 때도 이들의 부역자 역할은 계속되었습니다. 술탄 이브라힘은 이 부역자 중 제일 최근의 인물입니다. 이론적으로 그는 국정에 참석해 쇼난시 정부의 행동을 보증하고 민중을 통합시키는 의식적인 술탄입니다. 말레이반도는 언제나 그렇게 돌아갔습니다.\n\n하지만 늙은 술탄이 알아채지 못한 새로운 말레이반도가 떠오르고 있습니다. 술탄은 이를 막을 수 없습니다. 일본군의 군홧발과 기업의 만행은 그를 그의 민중으로부터 괴리시켰습니다. 모든 방면에서 찬란하게 빛나는 인종적 분열은 쇼난토를 산산조각 냈습니다. 술탄의 이름뿐인 통치에 대한 저항은 사방에서 자라납니다. 어딘가에서는 술탄 밑에 있는 유일한 정부 기관인 국민의회가 반란의 기운으로 끓어오른다고 합니다. 페락과 조호르의 언덕 위에 혁명의 망령이 감돌며 술탄의 꿈에 친펑의 유령이 나타났습니다. 술탄은 무력합니다. 그의 친척들은 예식 뒤에 숨어 기대감에 손가락을 두드립니다.\n\n술탄은 죽어가고 있지만 이를 슬퍼하는 사람은 별로 없습니다. 쇼난, 말레이반도, 그리고 일본인들은 그가 죽고 난 후에야 환상에 휩싸이지 않은 세상을 볼 것입니다. 술탄이 민중에게 줄 수 있는 가장 큰 선물은 죽고 난 뒤에 찾아올 미래일 것입니다. 말레이반도는 기다립니다. 그 너머에는 목줄을 붙잡은 호랑이가 있습니다."
 POLITICS_SULTAN_OMAR_ALI_SAIFUDDIEN_III_DESC:0 ""The Royal Poet" Omar Ali Saifuddien III, appointed with the aid of the gentry and Japanese business class, has numerous plans for Syonan unrivaled in their controversy and ambition.\n\nEducation, modernization, and independence are words that frequently arise in government thanks to the arrival of the new Sultan, much to the chagrin of the Japanese. With a mandate for reform, near unlimited royal authority, and a notebook of his own poems, there seems to be very little that Omar Alu Saifuddien III cannot accomplish."
 SYO_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "Located at one of the most important strategic points in the world, the "Light of the South" is one of the crown jewels of the Japanese Empire. The young nation has become a bustling home of immigrants, all seeking a better life. This has only served to the internal divide between the city of Shonan itself, where many of the Japanese and Chinese migrants have gravitated to, and the rest of the nation which itself is further divided between native Malayans, Chinese, and Indians. To compact this the agining ruler Sultan Ibrahim of Johor is on his last legs, putting the nation at a crossroads; to look beyond race in an attempt to reform or to wallow in this status quo divide. While both may lead to more pain, will this young yet ancient nation be able to stand on it's own two legs in the end?"

 syo.0.d:0 "Malaya and Singapore found themselves as one of the old British Empire's graveyards. The total rout and surrender of it's commonwealth garrison in February 1942, while morale crushing, would not be the empire's last. Since then, the former colony found itself under the grip of the Japanese and their collaborators.\n\nEducation was now conducted in Nippon-Go. Veneration of the Emperor and mass celebrations of anniversaries in the imperial calendar were enforced. The local economy was squeezed dry to support Japanese efforts. To finalize this 'rebirth', Singapore was renamed to Syonan, the Light of the South.\n\nIn Malaya, the Sultanates were kept intact and given just enough autonomy to their relief, but Perlis, Kedah, Kelantan and Terengganu were transferred to Thailand. Soon a wave of Japanese businessmen and emigrants made the peninsula their home.\n\nBy 1962, Syonan remains an important part of Japan's wider empire, with its rich raw resources fueling its blossoming population. Under the surface however, resentment against the Japanese has never been stronger."

 syo.4.t:0 "The Constitutional Convention Meets"
 syo.4.desc:0 "Daylight comes slow and uneasy over Kuala Lumpur. It's a gentle rousing for what will come to be known as the Month of Trouble: fitful the sun ascends over the rugged spine of Malaya, Titiwangsa Range, and as a dozen convoys descend on the Capitol Building (still half-covered with the work of frenetic renovation) it shines harsh over the streets of the Filipino Town, so called for the Army personnel in residence who were veterans of action on Mindanao in the Fifties. Already-clogged streets fill to the point of bursting and beyond. Media vans converge on the government buildings, bureaucrats and ever-watchful Kenpeitai fill the streets with as little discretion as they can muster. It will be a dangerous month - the police watch is doubled, searches are implemented on all entering the capital, and profiling of the many slummers in the teeming shantytowns surrounding KL proceeds with an irregular energy.\n\nThe Convention must decide the structure of Malaya in the days to come, and the Malay-Nationalists (as well as many convicted of the necessity of legislative reform in the Straits) have rallied around the idea of a Federation. The proposed flag, somehow leaked to the press almost immediately after its creation, flies everywhere, out of windows and laundry-poles and on streets, scuffed and defiant. The other alternative is, well, more of the same: and the elite of Malaya, be they Japanese or Malay or Chinese, have rallied around the idea that the Sultans and their attendant powers are key to preserving the peace in Malaya. It might not be the best-supported idea, but it's the line the elites are comfortable with, and who can argue with the logic of convenience?\n\nThe delegates meet at the break of dawn. Lee, Tunku, Yaacob, the Sultans and Sultan Omar and particular are all present. It is here that the future will be decided - or lost; Malaya awaits the results."
 syo.4.a:0 "Malaya steps into the future today."

 syo.5.t:0 "Centralization Of Powers"
 syo.5.desc:0 "The first question, and the most pertinent to those assembled, concerns the centralization of powers. The vaguely worded constitution, a direct result of the post-war confusion of reorganization, toes the line between fully central governance from Syonan-To and a commitment to local governance based on Sultanate and Province. For the most part the main beneficiaries of this policy have been the Sultans, who have used their nebulous powers to guide industry and economy with a gentle hand (if one ignores the signs of gross corruption in many states).\n\nLee Kuan Yew, with Lim Yew Hock firmly behind him, proposes to definitively correct this flaw by formally adopting a federal structure wherein central executives are chosen by parties who have won a plurality of state elections. The teeming slums and shantytowns will be afforded something resembling a genuine voice, if they are given more control over local politics: so too will Syonan-To, a fact which Lee's critics are quick to point out. On the other hand, Tunku Abdul-Rahman is in favor of the centralisation of governance through codified laws that affirm a central constituency and the veto-power of executives: the reach of UMNO, which he controls, favors a centralized state to make the radical adjustments he proposes to governance and policymaking. In any case, he reasons in his appeals, a divided Malaya is not something its people can long afford: it is a shark-filled sea, and land is not yet in sight. Many agree.\n\nThe issue is set before the Convention, and it is a hard fought fight. Eventually a solution emerges."
 syo.5.a:0 "Federal Governance it shall be!"
 syo.5.b:0 "Centralized Authority is what we need!"

 syo.6.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: The Sultan's Position And Powers"
 syo.6.desc:0 "The next topic of the council is one that there is at least some degree of consensus on. The issue of Sultan-centric governance has united the Syonanese people on one thing, namely that Sultan-centric governance is a thing of the past, and should be left in the past with all due haste. Sultan Saifuddien, for the most part, agrees - he is the first to raise a bill that proposes the immediate limiting of the Sultan's executive powers to that of a purely ceremonial role, managing diplomatic affairs as the Yang-Di Pertuan Negara. This is met with more or less unanimous approval: even the Japanese-influenced delegates understand that the time of Sultans is past.\n\nThe precise form the Sultans and the Yang-Di Pertuan Negara shall assume, however, is still up in the air: here the Convention splits, as it is so prone to doing. Tunku Abdul-Rahman proposes the use of Sultanate-authority as a bridge to the vital religious affairs of the Malay Community and as a sort of grassroots leadership which governments can draw upon for guidance - and, if necessary, control of the masses they are answerable to. This will enable the Sultanates to remain somewhat in control of their constituents, but fully subordinate to the State and its diktats. Lim Yew Hock, ever the businessman, has a more economic plan: the Sultans shall become wealth-fund managers, responsible for the cultivation of the state treasuries, and their administrations shall be pared down to accountants and investors. This will lower the burdens of the Government and allow for Sultans to play some degree of responsibility in handling their vast estates. It will also, however, totally isolate them from political power, which does not go unnoticed.\n\nThe debate becomes unexpectedly bitter - historical baggage has a way of poisoning discourse. Nevertheless, a vote must be held, and a decision reached: and so, in the usual fumbling manner, it is."
 syo.6.a:0 "Keep the Sultans as leaders of the people in spirit!"
 syo.6.b:0 "Sultans should stick to the checkbook, not politicking!"


 syo.7.t:0 "The Light In The South"
 syo.7.desc:0 "Syonan-to is a beautiful place in the Pacific dawn. Glittering skyfront touches earth and reaches the smog-cast sky, industrial and refinery flame glinting off the sides of zaibatsu windows. Chatter reaches the streets and spills into the tea-houses, the hotels and the factories in a garbled mix of Malay, Chinese, Japanese and residual English (the trade tongue of old has not yet been lost). Businesses open in the thousands and wait for the bounty of the trade-routes to reach their doorstep in lorries and automobiles, curling in from roads so overcrowded and undermaintained they have become a focal point of political debate. And the slums awaken too: the coolies and the workers of the new Light of the South, the burning oil under the blazing lamp, must throw themselves anew into the blazing brilliance of the Jewel of the Sphere. What does it matter if a few do not return?\n\nThe Politicians in the Diet worry, as they often do, about the thousand issues that keep the city down: trade infrastructure is falling apart due to frequent use and occasional Communist sabotage, the 18th raid on Chin Peng has ended in a self-declared victory and no body to show for it, the Malays and Indians are continuing to push for greater autonomy in self-funded schools (ignoring the generous Zaibatsu donations that made them possible) and, of course, the Sultans have it in for the annoyingly successful city in their rear. Above it all the Japanese population, proud and unbowed and utterly insufferable: and below them the Chinese, endless and long-suffering, like gargoyles supporting angels on a crumbling cathedral wall.\n\nIt's peace. Of a sort. But one thing is for sure: nothing ever lasts long in the swelter of heat and the glitz of the endless marketplace - and who can say what the next morning will bring, gold or fire?"
 syo.7.a:0 "The city that can't sleep."

 syo.8.t:0 "Fire At The Coffeehouse"
 syo.8.desc:0 "Most riots simmer long before the streets fill with fire and trash. They curl in the damp spaces too soft for the ears of the police, stretching tendrils of gossip and suspicion with every half-whisper, and it is there that the anger curdles to hatred - and then to violence. Riots are made long before they break out, long before the government catches word: and so this is where the Syonan-To Riot begins, outside a damp sake-soaked coffeehouse on the outskirts of the Central District, far beyond the ears of the Kenpeitai and the Diet, on a day that will fade from history when it is over.\n\nIt begins, as with most things, with a conversation that carries on far too long for comfort. The participants are lost to history, perhaps forever - the controversial has a way of being blotted out in Syonan, for the public good - but this is known: some at the coffeehouse on October 13th are Japanese businessmen, some are Chinese middle-class civil servants, some are Malay and Indian shopkeepers. All have been brought to gossip by the latest round of Zaibatsu import quotas imposed from Tokyo, but none have agreeing views on the matter. The Chinese civil servants are sharpest and most bitter in their criticism: the yoke of taxation and overwork is endemic, but falls hardest on them. The Japanese businessmen view the men in Tokyo as right, but misguided in their aims - the Indians and Malays, of course, are worried about the dominance of Japanese firms, and why shouldn't they be? Nobody can ignore the slow collapse of the old Indian-Malay economic holdings in a land that is still called Malaya by some.\n\nThree viewpoints, one point of division, an argument that feeds on itself and grows to inebriated, incendiary heights. The owner later testifies to a bar brawl that is only broken up by the police, but the main participants flee ahead of time. One of them promises that in a week, Japanese holdings will go up in flames across Malaya - and then he is gone, a Cassandra lost in the hot wind of the Malayan night."
 syo.8.a:0 "Is this a threat, a promise or a prophecy?"

 syo.9.t:0 "The Tinder, The Spark, The Match"
 syo.9.desc:0 "Anger continues to grow in the week after the coffeehouse incident (which is quickly shushed up by local authorities, lest it trigger the ever-watching and ever-tetchy Garrison Authorities), just not in public spaces. The Kenpeitai have toned down considerably from their monstrous heights, preferring calm corruption to brutality, but they are still capable and dangerously competent when it comes time for them to do their dirty work. The whispers grow and grow and grow to fever pitch, just out of sight, dancing like fireflies atop a placid lake, and then -\n\nOctober 17th: Sumitomo announces a round of minor economic restructuring in the Syonan-To branch, laying off a few dozen employees to integrate a new branch of Tokyo-based operation chain managers. Most of those laid off are Malay and Indian. Not many are affected, but to many already suspicious of the Zaibatsu concerns this is proof that the Japanese intend to push out local concerns and uproot native industry, yoking Malaya permanently to the Sphere. Security guards report fistfights at the factory and angered rhetoric in the ethnic enclaves of the East and Central districts, calls to action - and to arms.\n\nOctober 19th: A Chinese coolie is found murdered off a hotel. The details are sketchy at first reportage. Due to subsequent circumstances, the body is only partially examined before subsequent events make further inquiries impossible. Notable eyewitnesses to the body include several Japanese businessmen and managers, a few policemen - and a gang of Chinese from the endless slums of the central and north. The latter engage in a hasty retreat, but not before promising vengeance for the spilt blood.\n\nOctober 20th: mobs of Chinese, Malays and Indians are marching in the city, roused to anger by the fear and the rhetoric surrounding them. The Prophet's Birthday celebrations went off smoothly a few months back with adequate crowd control, but the local Guard make 2 critical mistakes: they send a single detachment, and every single member of the detachment is a Japanese officer."
 syo.9.a:0 "This doesn't sound ominous at all."

 syo.10.t:0 "Burning In The Dawn"
 syo.10.desc:0 "It's unclear what exactly triggers the riots, given the subsequent chaos that follows the riots. The exact circumstances are lost to police reports that burn with the rest of the government buildings. Some later voice suspicions that the Diet has had a hand covering up the evidence - these voices are quickly silenced, by means that are either legal or... well, there's plenty of room under the dockyards for those who will not abide by the rules of the game.\n\nThis much is clear: 2 mobs meet on Rochor Street, separated by a thin line of Japanese guards. The men are recruits sent straight from barracks, and limited in their comprehension of the local lingua franca: stuttering Malay does nothing to ease already troubled hearts, especially when some of those troubled hearts are Chinese. The detachment commander asks to speak to the head of the two demonstrations, believing that they are part of a joint protest. For his mistake he is mocked in languages he cannot comprehend, as the crowd swells beyond the bounds of the street, cowing local shopkeepers into submission. The Diet, of course, is silent. The crowds don't trust each other: the middle-class Malays and Indians see the Chinese as saboteurs and worse, the Chinese despise the Malays and Indians uplifted by Japanese benevolence while they have been struck down under their boot.\n\nFaced with a situation he cannot control, the commander radios his base for aid and backup: this is where accounts diverge. Chinese protestors swear up and down that he orders the police to fire on them. Indian protestors swear that the police are ordered to ignore the Chinese and push back the Malays and Indians. The news spreads to the entirety of the crowds in both variants, becoming exponentially more incendiary as it gathers pace and fury. Both mobs surge forward at the same time in a desperate attempt to pre-empt an attack they believe is inevitable, overwhelming the thin blue line. The commander is never seen again."
 syo.10.a:0 "Oh shit."

 syo.11.t:0 "Burning In The Day"
 syo.11.desc:0 "The riot rages on the street and spreads beyond it. Word of mouth is a powerful thing, and cannot be controlled - virality translates to memetic discourse very well. Threats, fears and pain become more dangerous as the crowds rush by huddled families, and the urge to revenge grows more tangible with the thudding heart. And underneath it all the resentments of the old years fester and break into a bloody blossom. Mobs and gangs raise hell on the streets, barricading factories and wrecking any house that seems, in the words of a gang member who is later interrogated, 'too rich, too powerful, too big, too Japanese.'\n\nViolence begets violence as the Garrison struggle to execute a collective response in the wake of unparalleled violence since the Conquest of Malaya itself. Residents retreat to enclaves, take up rusty parangs and bayonets, and prepare to kill those who seem a threat. (Many villagers protect ethnic outliers in their hometowns, an act of quiet defiance that goes more or less unnoticed by everyone else.) Rage quickly spreads to the economic dimension - and to the political, as the Police Commissioner's Office is burnt to the ground, along with many prominent Zaibatsu offices. The Diet faffles and waits for order to be restored, pulling soldiers from vital defense positions to protect itself. Malayan sultans unequivocally condemn the riots almost as hard as they condemn the Diet for its inaction. The Diet might be incapable of handling its own turf, but at least it can be roused to angry self-defense: the war of words that follows makes the entirety of Syonanese governance seem even more pathetic as the death toll rises outside the glass windows.\n\nIn a famous image, the burning of the city dusts the skyline and the horizon above it in a thick cloud of soot: reporters speculate that the smoke and soot come from the destruction of an armaments storehouse near Keppel, destroyed to prevent 'Communist Saboteurs' from reaching the warehouse and looting it. No evidence of Communist infiltration of the demonstrations is ever found."

We believe that this surprising precedent will only spell greater promise for the fledgeling Malayan Film industry - '\n\n' - the synopsis is deeper than you think. Look at the plot! So Labu and Labi work for a rich but stubborn man, right? They want to be magistrates, doctors, but they can't, physically constrained by their duties to the rich man. And the rich man works for who? That's right, a Zaibatsu. The film is just one giant metaphor for what the Sphere is really doing, keeping us down while - '\n\n' - well, I think the film's great and all, but I feel maybe he's being lifted a little high.

Tokenism only works when we have multiple tokens! - '\n\n' - listen, I don't really care what you think, all I know is that I'm a Ramlee fan, tried and tested, and if you don't like it you can jump off the docks at Melaka.

P. Ramlee is a mask, a smiling tribute to all who know him: and behind that mask is a brilliant nothingness, as far as Syonan is concerned. Who is P. Ramlee? The answer seems to be that he is anyone the people of Malaya want him to be - reformist, smiling establishment supporter, militant Muslim, cheerful secularist, anyone's ally and no one's true friend. Deflection is, after all, a form of reflection, and who doesn't want to see themselves reflected in Malaya's greatest film star. But who is Teuku Zakaria? When P. Ramlee takes off his mask and his suit and steps out of the limelight, who does he become?\n\nWe step into his house, a pleasant terraced house in the classier suburbs of Kuala Lumpur, and we're met with a strong scent of jasmine: apparently Saloma, or simply Salmah Ismail, as she likes to be called, likes the smell of perfume, and so Zakaria has made great efforts to buy perfume. He smiles at us and makes small talk about the weather as she bustles about the kitchen: despite their 7 year long marriage the two have never had a child, a fact the two attribute to their busy career (both of them have, of course, shared the set for a very long time in film and music).\n\nHis face grows serious when we begin to discuss his most prominent comments on the growing racial and economic divides in Syonan-To and in urban areas in Malaya proper: he brings up the subject of his childhood in an impoverished home and how the Japanese saved him from a life of penury by bringing him to Navy School and subsequently to Tokyo, where his career began. 'If not for the Japanese, I would have been poor all my life!' he chuckles, and then grows serious once more: 'So what makes me so different from the coolies and starving outside? Is it not in the words of the Prophet that we must, like Him, be a mercy to the worlds?'"

It's one thing to stir up a little trouble, but to invite it into our doorstep? Like this?
