 BUL_the_tsars_government:0 "차르 정부"
 BUL_the_tsars_government_desc:0 "Though the Kingdom of Bulgaria is technically a constitutional monarchy, the constitutional part of that has long been disregarded. Parliament's edicts and bills mean nothing in comparison compared to the Tsar's powers, as the Tsar rules Bulgaria as what is effectively an absolute monarchy. Indeed, the only power in Bulgaria comparable to the Tsar is the Germans, who's garrison posts a constant reminder of who the real master of Europe is. With Tsar Boris unwilling to give up the vast power that the Tsardom holds in today's Bulgaria, it seems this balance of power is not soon to change."
 BUL_the_fatherland_front:0 "조국전선"
 BUL_the_fatherland_front_desc:0 "There is only one source of organized anti-German resistance in Bulgaria today- the Fatherland Front, a nationalistic, anti German organization that has plagued us since the war. Originally a communist organization, the Front has reorganized into a nationalistic resitance group ever since the fall of the Soviets. Today, they serve as a constant threat to the peace and stability of Bulgaria.\n\nThough Bulgaria's resistance problem is nowhere near the scale of some other Einheitspakt nations, it's enough to endanger our stability, as well as giving the Germans a convenient excuse to keep their dagger pointed firmly at our throats."
 BUL_german_forged_shackles:0 "German Forged Shackles"
 BUL_german_forged_shackles_desc:0 "On paper, Bulgaria is a free, independent member of the Einheitspakt, working with Germany to advance Europe into a new dawn. In practice, Bulgaria is yet another nation that has been firmly tied to the German machine, forced to work for their ends above their own. The German garrison works not to protect Bulgaria, but to keep the people from breaking free. Their presence not only angers most Bulgarians, but strikes fear in their hearts- what if the German war machine sets its eyes on Sofia?\n\n Not much truly unites the Bulgarian people these days, but one thing does, from the average worker to the parliamentarian to the Tsar himself- the Germans must go. Unfortunately, the Germans don't seem to agree."
