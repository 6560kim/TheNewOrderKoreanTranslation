T4 안락사 작전의 관리자. T4 프로그램에 각하께서 밀접히 연관되어 있다는 사실을 아주 잘 알고 있고, 이 사실을 각하께 해가 되는 방향으로 이용할 수 있습니다. 비고: 브란트 씨와 각하의 사적으로 밀접한 관계에도 불구하고, 그는 각하의 통치에 심각한 위해를 끼칠 가능성이 있습니다. 특히 개혁파들이 각하께 제공하는 지지에 위협적일 것입니다. \n\n 제거 대상 2호: 카를 한케. 하슐레지엔 대관구 지도관. 각하를 괴벨스 씨에게 추천한 덕택에, 당 내에서 각하의 권력이 강화되는데 도움을 주었습니다. 각하의 논란이 될 만한 법률 중 다수를 알고 있고, 이는 아주 위험합니다. RND의 자료에 따르면 SS의 부르군트 기사단국과 연결되어 있다고 합니다. 비고: 다시 말씀드리자면, 각하와의 사적으로 밀접한 관계에도 불구하고, 한케는 각하의 권력과 영향력에 심대한 위협을 가하고 있습니다. 자신의 지식을 각하께 반하는 방향으로 이용할지도 모르는 일입니다. \n\n 제거 대상 3호: 한스 카믈러. 공학자. V2 로켓에 대한 공헌으로 유명합니다. 한때 각하의 부하였습니다. 과거 각하께서 노예를 이용하고 그들을 혹독하게 대했음을 알고 있습니다. 각하와는 아무런 개인적 관계가 없기에 도리어 각하께 반하는 방식으로 자신이 아는 사실을 이용할 수 있습니다. \n\n 다시 한 번 말씀드리지만, 이들 각자는 각하와 각하의 총통 직위에 다모클레스의 칼을 들이밀고 있으며, 언젠가는 그것을 떨어뜨리게 될 것입니다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 시간을 오래 소요할수록, 각하께 반하는 사실이 단 하나라도 유출될 가능성은 높아져만 갈 것입니다. 즉각적으로 행동에 나서시기를 권해드립니다. \n\n 라인하르트 게렌 올림."

RND.2.d:0 "슈페어는 두 눈에 눈물이 그렁그렁한 채 잠시 멈췄다. 소규모 대중들은 슈페어에게 딱 붙어 있기라도 한듯 슈페어의 동작 하나하나를 지켜보고 있었다. 마침내 잠시 동안 마음을 가라앉힌 후에 슈페어는 입을 열었다. \n\n "오늘 이 자리에 서서 제 가장 오랜 친구들 중 한 명을 떠나보내고 울고 있으니 마음이 정말 찢어집니다. 갈기갈기 찢어집니다. 카를 브란트는 좋은 사람이었습니다. 그는 과학과 의학에 헌신했던 자였으며 오랜 옛날 저와 가장 가까웠던 친구들 중 하나였습니다. 시간이 지나면서 우리가 서로 석먹해졌을지 몰라도, 우리 사이에 공유하던 유대감은 결코 죽지 않았습니다. 그리고 카를의 갑작스러운 죽음에 제 비통함을 온전히 다 표현할 수 없을 것 같습니다. 그 자동차 사고는 우리 독일국의 소중한 보석을 깨뜨려 버렸고, 우리 모두 단지 인간에 불과하며 이 땅에서 살아 있는 나날을 보물처럼 소중히 여겨야 한다는 것을 나머지 사람들에게 깨우쳐주고 있습니다..." \n\n 하지만 관 속에서 지금 평화로이 누워 있는 카를 브란트는 슈페어를 대신하여 이야기를 들려줄 수 있었다. 이는 총통이 말한 추도 연설과는 아주 다른 이야기였을 것이다. 어쩌면 그는 퇴근 하는 동안 앞에서 달리던 트럭 한 대가 천천히 달리고 그가 빠른 속도로 도로를 달리게 할 수밖에 없었던 일을 청중들에게 즐겁게 이야기했을지도 모른다. 그는 갑작스러운 충돌로 얼떨떨하고 망연자실해있는 동안, 여러 명의 RND 요원들이 그의 자동차를 에워쌌던 사실을 강조했을지도 모른다. 그는 분명 자동차 잔해 앞에 서 있던 남자가 아직도 브란트가 움직였는지 알아차리고 권총을 뽑아들어 브란트의 두개골에 총알 하나를 직접 박아 넣었는지 소리를 지르며 설명했을지도 모른다. 브란트는 자신을 죽인 자들이 불을 질러 차를 집어 삼키게 하고 그들이 관련되었다는 모든 증거를 파괴했다며 이야기를 끝마쳤을지도 모른다. \n\n 하지만 카를 브란트는 죽었다. 대중들은 그들의 총통이 말을 끝마치자 일어서서 박수를 보냈다. 카를 브란트의 갑작스러운 죽음 뒤에 숨겨진 진실을 의심조차 하지 않으면서."

RND.3.t:0 "카를 한케가 암살당하다!"
RND.3.d:0 "카토비츠 - 오늘 독일국의 관료들에게 비극적인 소식이 전해졌다. 총통 각하의 막역한 친구이자 슐레지엔 대관구 지도관으로 유명했던 카를 한케가 암살당했다! 나치당의 충성스러운 고위 당원이었던 그는 카토비츠 근처의 사냥 별장에서 슐레지엔의 부대들과 휴가를 보내고 있었으나, 어젯밤 저녁 산책에서 돌아오지 않았다. 다음날 아침 병사들이 그를 찾으러 수색작업을 벌였고, 그들은 가슴에 총상을 몇 군데 입은 채 나무에 기대어 죽어있는 한케를 찾았다. 수색 병사들 중 하나였던 의무관은 한케가 그 당시 이미 죽어있었다고 발표했다. 이후 검시관의 보고서에 따르면 한케는 발견되기 수 시간 전부터 죽어 있던 상태였다고 한다. 더욱 걱정스러운 점은, 주변에서 발견된 흔적을 보았을 때 한케가 폴란드의 기관단총이나 권총으로 살해되었음을 확인했다는 점이다. 현지 질서경찰 경관들은 최근 수 년 동안 총독령 국경 너머에서 폴란드 테러리스트 단체가 활동했으며, 최소한 한 단원이 잡히지 않은 상태임을 확인했다. \n\n 총통 각하께서는 한케의 암살에 대해 이렇게 말씀하셨다. "이 사건은 나에게 너무나도 충격이었습니다. 많은 당원들이 잘 알고 있듯이, 정부 내에서 내가 경력을 시작할 수 있었던 것은 고 괴벨스 박사에게 한케가 제출한 추천서 덕분이었습니다. 내가 그에게 총통이라는 자리를 빚졌을 뿐만 아니라, 그는 친애하는 나의 친구였고 긴 세월 동안 그 관계를 유지했습니다. 우리의 용감한 경찰관들과 수사관들이 이 사건에 대하여 만족스러운 결과를 내놓고 나의 친구이자 동료였던 그를 위해서 정의를 구현해줄 것을 온 마음을 다하여 기원합니다." \n\n 카를 한케는 SS에 대해 지속적으로 지지를 보냈다는 점에서 최근 수 년간 약간 논쟁이 되었던 인물이었다. 그는 정치적인 관점으로 인해 나치당의 동료 당원들에게 이따금씩 비판을 받아야 했다. 하지만 내전 직후 총통 각하에 의해 배신자들과 연결되어 있다는 혐의는 완전히 무죄였음이 밝혀졌다. 한케의 유족으로는 아내인 프레다 폰 피르크스 남작 부인과 딸 하나가 있다."

speerpoland.4.d:0 "The first time the 10th Panzer Division entered Poland was in 1939. Then, they had fought their way through the fields of Europe, shredding the Polish Army, marching all the way to the hell that was the battle of Warsaw. Thousands of dead later, the city- and Poland- was theirs.\n\nTheir commander was hoping it would not need to happen again.\n\nThe men eyed the border guards on the Polish side as they raised the gate. Was there an ambush down the road? A division ready to kill any German they saw? As they drove through, tank commanders kept their hatches down and their guns up, ready for the attack they knew was coming.\n\nAnd yet, with every kilometer they drove with no interruption, their fear began to turn to disbelief. When they reached their first town, each and every tank commander silently sweat as the division of Armia Krajowa they were to disarm stood at attention. This is it, most thought. This was the moment where it all went to hell.\n\nWhen the Poles actually began to hand over their rifles, the disbelief was written all the 10th's faces as they handed out their medicine and food. The commander of the Poles was last in line- he took his food and medicine, looked into the German commander's stunned eyes, and smirked before walking away."

speerpoland.5.t:0 "An Early Repatriation"
speerpoland.5.d:0 "The crowd around Warsaw's train station swelled well out of the station, into the street, and down several blocks. Thousands of people lined the railroad, watching for the German trains carrying the most precious cargo they could. When the first line of smoke was sighted, far down the line, a shock of excitement swept through the crowd and the police line braced for impact.\n\nBy the time the train pulled into the station, a hushed tension had overtaken the crowd. Necks craned as German guards hopped from their carriages, securing a perimeter and a way out of the crowd. The tension in the air grew thick and heavy as the doors to the carrier cars opened.\n\nWhen the first slave, still in his prison uniform, stepped slowly into the sun, there was a moment of disbelief. Suddenly, the crowd exploded into cheers, chanting, yelling, and the police line buckled under the weight of thousands straining against them. As the slaves walked down the passage set out for them, flowers poured down onto their heads. Families strained to see loved ones.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the first truly joyous day for all of Poland since the revolution- their men were coming home. If the Germans were coming with them, so be it."

Speidel's offer has been accepted in full, and the stipulations of the peace are already beginning to be enforced.\n\nSpeer smiled when he read the message, already feeling the constant headache he had begin to clear. Thank god for Speidel. No treaty terms, no negotiations, no back and forth. Just a simple, clear statement and a simple, clear response. No Germans would die over Poland, and another victory for Speer would be delivered to his doorstep.\n\nAs he sat down, he made a mental reminder to invite Speidel over for a drink or two sometime. The man certainly deserved it."
speerpoland.6.a:0 "Splendid."

speerpoland.7.t:0 "The Polish Decline"
speerpoland.7.d:0 "Stunning news from Warsaw today- the Polish government has lost its mind. At least, that's the assumption of the Fuhrer's office, as instead of the diplomatic victory we expected, we've been delivered a bewildering refusal of our terms. To call this unexpected would be a massive understatement, as would it be a massive understatement to call this foolish. Poland stands no chance against the Reich's war machine- indeed, it seems this decision is made only in a desperate grasp to retain a sense of national pride. Whatever the motive, it seems that violence is inevitable.\n\nSpeer could feel his headache pulsate with every word of the refusal he read. Enraged, he tossed the letter into his trashcan. Were they serious? Did they think they would stand any chance against the Heer? Was this all merely an attempt to make Speer's life as hard as possible? In any case, it was clear- German boots would march over the Polish plains once again as invaders. The Fuhrer sighed as he sat down- this would be a mess in the Reichstag. He could only hope that Speidel was not as bad a commander as he was a negotiator."
speerpoland.7.a:0 "Damn it."

speerpoland.8.t:0 "Speak Softly"
speerpoland.8.d:0 ""So, Herr Schmidt. I've read about your plan." Speer looked up from his desk, his eyes meeting his Foreign Minister's. "I'd like you to explain it to me more, because frankly, I don't understand why we need to go to this much effort over a place like Poland."\n\nSchmidt straightened his tie. "It's less about Poland itself and more about the international effects, my Fuhrer."\n\nSpeer leaned back in his chair. "Elaborate."\n\n"Well, we could enforce our will through force of arms on the Poles, as we did in the 30's, but the main issue is that internationally, this would threaten our image as a reformist, gentler Reich."\n\n"The issue with your plan, Herr Schmidt, is that it's going to force us into promises we might not want to keep."\n\n"I understand my plan is not perfect, but it is the only way to keep our image safe. Besides, negotiation means no bloodshed, and neither of us want that, do we?" Schmidt smiled.\n\n"No, of course not. I give you permission to go ahead. Don't screw this up for me, will you?" Speer shuffled in his chair. Schmidt nodded before leaving the room, the hopes of the Reich's new standing resting squarely on his shoulders."
speerpoland.8.a:0 "We'll see how this goes."

speerpoland.9.t:0 "Offer for Diplomacy from Germany"
speerpoland.9.d:0 "Surprising news has come from Germania today- it seems that Helmut Schmidt, the Reich's foreign minister, wishes to negotiate a peace between the Reich and Poland. Should we agree to this? If we decline, the Reich may invade- something which, despite our best hopes, will be nearly impossible to defeat."
speerpoland.9.a:0 "Agree"
speerpoland.9.b:0 "Decline"

speerpoland.10.t:0 "A Step Towards the Future"
speerpoland.10.d:0 "The news passed through the Foreign Ministry's hands quickly, fast tracked to two offices- Helmut Schmidt's and Albert Speer. The message read like a celebration- the Poles had, after much consideration and debate, accepted talks with Helmut Schmidt. Together, they wrote, they hoped that Poland and Germany would work together to take Europe into an ascendant future, these talks being the groundworks to lay such a foundation. Of course, it was all diplomatic flattery for now- nobody would dare to be brutally honest this early- but it was enough for Germany, and it was certainly enough for Schmidt and Speer.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert read the letter with a sigh of relief as he took a drink. Worries danced in his mind- what if they forced the Reich's hand? What if Schmidt promised the stars and the sun?- but he sidelined them for now. For now, things were moving along smoothly. Speer had to admit, despite his personal dislike of Schmidt, he got things done.\n\nIn Schmidt's office, Helmut took the news joyously. He had expected them to accept, but it actually happening gave him an opening. With the cooperation of the Poles, he could help set things right, once and for all, and Europe would be one step closer to the light."
speerpoland.10.a:0 "The hopes of Poland rest uneasy."

speerpoland.11.t:0 "Falling Back"
speerpoland.11.d:0 "The news shattered the morale of every hand it touched- a lightning strike to the reformists, a frustrating setback to the Speerites. It slowly slid its way through the Foreign Ministry, to be deposited with a thump on the desks of Speer and Schmidt. The news it communicated would be dismissed as comedy if it wasn't so real- the Poles, for whatever insane reason, had declined to negotiate, promising to defend Poland to the final man. Negotiations were dead before they even had the chance to begin.\n\nIn Speer's office, Albert sat with a mixture of a sigh and an angered grunt. He'd listened to Schmidt for once, and look where it got them. The Poles thought they were weak, thought that Germany wouldn't be willing to take them on, all because Schmidt had decided to try and throw a rabid dog a carrot. Now, the Heer would need to get its hands dirty. He could already see the coffins, draped in the swastika, coming home from whatever muddy hellhole the Poles were in now. He could see the shitshow in the Reichstag from a mile away. Schmidt had gotten his way, and now look what had happened.\n\nIn Schmidt's office was, somehow, even more depressed than Speer's. Helmut slammed the letter into his trashcan with an angry grunt. He'd gambled, and somehow the Poles had screwed him over for it. What did they expect to happen? All they had done was make things worse for everyone. He sat down and awaited the angry call from a million different officials- the plan had collapsed, and here he was with a giant target on his back. He downed a drink before he took the first one."
speerpoland.11.a:0 "What do they think they're doing?"

speerpoland.12.t:0 "Germans in Poland"
speerpoland.12.d:0 "The tension between the two delegations lay thick and heavy in the conference room. Schmidt's eyes nervously darted across the faces of the Polish negotiators, settling finally on their head- one Stanislaw Wachowiak. Wachowiak's eyes bored right into Schmidt as the clock hit 12, and the meeting officially began.\n\nThe initial pleasantries soon faded away into a mess of diplomatic jargon, as veiled barbs and offers soon flew across the table. Unsurprisingly, it was not long before the first roadblock hit- the status of Germans in Poland.\n\n"The privileges that Germans in Poland held under the Generalgouvernement are unacceptable! We're practically chattel compared to them! Second class citizens in our own nation! We cannot, repeat, cannot go back to the old way of things- not now, not ever! They cannot continue to hold the privileges that they once did!" Wachowiak finished his fiery rant with a hearty slap of the table, to applause from his own delegation. The German delegation turned to Schmidt, his face deep in thought. A partial repeal of the Nuremberg Laws- something he'd wanted for years, but something that may fall well afoul of Speer's expectation. Besides, removing the rights of Germans for the wants of Poles- a group that much of Germany still considered "Untermensch''- was undoubtedly a shit show waiting to happen in itself. However, would the Poles accept a deal without this caveat? He sighed before responding, knowing these words would follow him forever."
speerpoland.12.a:0 "Keep up the Laws."
speerpoland.12.b:0 "The Poles deserve rights."

speerpoland.13.t:0 "Status of the Home Army"
speerpoland.13.d:0 ""Now, Mr. Wachowiak, onto the next topic- the Home Army." Schmidt read from his agenda slowly, taking a breath before continuing. "As previously agreed, the Home Army will disarm and disband, assuming these talks go through. This is correct, yes?"\n\n"Of course." Wachowiak straightened his tie as he spoke. Schmidt rolled his eyes as he reached the next point, bracing himself for the explosion.\n\n"Yes, of course. However, there have been calls from our more conservative counterparts to prosecute some of these men for, ah. . .'' Schmidt could see Wachowiak turning red in the face already, and he readied himself for the explosion. "Ah, treason and terrorism. Now, Mr. Wachowiak, these men did commit acts of violence against the German garrison-"\n\nWachowiak shot to his feet. "You're joking, Herr Schmidt! You can't be serious! You dare call fighting for freedom terrorism? Do you know how hard it's been to get the Home Army to even agree to disarm? They'll go ballistic! If you're going to arrest every freedom fighter in Poland, you may as well arrest this entire delegation, because I cannot think of a Polish man who did not fight the Germans! This is unacceptable, Herr Schmidt, simply unacceptable!" He roared, leaning over the table towards the German. Schmidt massaged his temples- a headache was coming on, and he doubted it would get any better until these talks finished."
speerpoland.13.a:0 "Disarmament shall suffice."
speerpoland.13.b:0 "Terrorism is terrorism."

speerpoland.14.t:0 "Status of Polish Slavery"
speerpoland.14.d:0 ""We both understand that the Fuhrer's policy on slavery is one of dismantlement, is that right?" Wachowiak spoke first this time, his voice having noticeably softened in the last hour or so. The attention of the table once again turned to him, including Schmidt's gaze.\n\n"Yes, that would be true." Schmidt responded, his eyes narrowing, a hint of Wachowiak's game beginning to form in his mind. Another bombshell, if Schmidt's intuition was true.\n\n"And these freed slaves are to be repatriated to their home nations, yes?" Wachowiak's gaze bored into Schmidt, who grew increasingly sure of where this conversation was being taken. He prepared a response in his head- this would be another headache to add to the pile.\n\n"Yes, that's the plan." Schmidt responded, steeling his voice.\n\n"Thousands of Poles still find themselves in German shackles today, Herr Schmidt, with years left before their freedom. Surely, as part of these talks, it's possible to speed their freedom, is it not?" Wachowiak's gaze never left Schmidt's eyes as he tried to think of a diplomatic response to this one.\n\n"Repatriation is a complicated business, especially when combined with-"\n\n"It's a yes-no question, Herr Schmidt." Schmidt slumped a little in his chair. This was never going to end, was it?"
speerpoland.14.a:0 "We need to stay realistic about Repatriation."
speerpoland.14.b:0 "Push for quicker Polish repatriation."

speerpoland.15.t:0 "Status of the Nuremberg Laws"
speerpoland.15.d:0 "The end of the conference was in sight, and Schmidt for one couldn't wait for it. He had known that his decisions would cause a storm of anger somewhere, no matter what he said, but he couldn't help but feel like this was going to be especially bad. His eyes, which had begun to glaze over with the endless conversation, snapped back to attention when they saw Wachowiak rise from his seat.\n\n"Now, I understand we have already touched on the topic of the Nuremberg laws-" Oh, christ, Schmidt thought. If there was something to fill his desk with angry letters, it was the Nuremberg laws."-But we have only spoken of the excessive privilege that Germans held in Poland. What we have not discussed is Polish rights- specifically, how limited they are."\n\nAs Wachowiak went through the list of limits on the Poles, Schmidt's thoughts turned inward. Once again, here was an opportunity to strike another blow at something that he had hated since the day he joined this job- the Nuremberg Laws, an outdated weight on the ankle of Germany, one that needed to be cut off. In any other case, he would not hesitate in cutting another slice into the Laws, but now? The Laws were the main legal guideline for Germany's treatment of the Poles. Such a massive change would definitely be something Speer would like to know about, and that was what was holding Schmidt back. He did not know Speer's position on the issue, and despite how much he disliked the man personally, Speer was the one who controlled his job. To go against him too much might just lead to his dismissal- something Schmidt couldn't allow to happen.\n\n"So, Herr Schmidt, I ask you-" Wachowiak finished with a flourish, leveling an accusatory finger at Schmidt's head. "-Is the Reich truly as reformist as it claims? Will you throw off the shackles that bind Poland?""
speerpoland.15.a:0 "Tone down on the Laws."
speerpoland.15.b:0 "This is too much to ask right now."

speerpoland.16.t:0 "Polish Budget"
speerpoland.16.d:0 ""Before this conference wraps up, Herr Schmidt, we have but one more topic to discuss." Wachowiak carefully pressed forth with the last topic on his paper, catching Schmidt as he was about to rise from his seat. Schmidt froze for a second, his face momentarily betraying the stress this conference had put on him, before he sat back down and gestured for Wachowiak to continue.\n\n"Besides the infrastructure built for Poland to become the Reich's logistical hub, Poland as a whole was neglected by the Reich. Our infrastructure in most places fails, our utilities are on the brink of failing, our roads are dotted with holes and cracks- we're on the brink of a disaster, Herr Schmidt. The Reich's coffers are certainly not empty- perhaps you can send some funds to our new government in order to allow us to rebuild? I promise you, such funds would be spent on infrastructure alone, nothing more."\n\nSchmidt took a deep breath in and out. Of course they were going for the wallet of the Reich now, as if they hadn't already aimed daggers at the rest of the Reich's institutions. Schmidt wasn't opposed to it himself- he just knew that it would maximise the amount of angry paperwork he'd need to sort through in the next month or two. Thoughts of a raging Speer clouded his mind- how many decisions had he already made for the Fuhrer? How many of them had been directly against his wishes?\n\nIn any case, it was the last decision to make, and then they would all shake hands and retire to their hotel rooms. Schmidt could only hope that his decisions would be acceptable to the Polish government- otherwise, this was going to be a mess for everyone involved."
speerpoland.16.a:0 "Grant them money."

speerpoland.17.t:0 "The Treaty is Signed"
speerpoland.17.d:0 "Television crews crowded the conference room, reporters crammed themselves into every nook and cranny of the building, and the flash of cameras rattled like a machine gun. Schmidt did his best not to blink at the barrage- the last thing he needed on top of the inevitable storm he was going to catch was an unflattering image of him smeared across the front pages of every newspaper in Germany.\n\nTo his right, Wachowiak sat and smiled, looking quite pleased with himself. Schmidt couldn't blame him- he was going home a hero, having taken on the German giant and wrangled a deal that Poland could get behind out of it. Schmidt was less enthused himself- he would be going home to a storm of conservative anger and, most likely, at least one or two tense meetings with Speer. Speer hadn't said anything about the terms yet, but some of them would certainly be enough to make him tear what remained of his hair out.\n\nAnd yet, at the end of the day, Schmidt was proud of himself. He'd not only succeeded in his task, but he'd advanced his cause. Germany was on the cusp of entering a new golden age, and with Schmidt's help, he would make sure it would happen. With the treaty signed, who knew what could happen with the rest of Eastern Europe? Perhaps, soon enough, Germany could truly be first among equals in their eyes, not just a colonial overlord.\n\nAnd so, as Wachowiak put pen to paper and signed his name on the treaty, Schmidt's expression turned into a small grin as he put ink to his own."
speerpoland.17.a:0 "The new golden age is almost here."

speerpoland.18.t:0 "The Treaty Falls Apart"
speerpoland.18.d:0 "Schmidt's room was dark, illuminated only by a lamp at his desk casting a yellow glow across it. The darkness hid most of the two men's faces- Schmidt and Wachowiak. Schmidt glanced at the clock- 2 in the morning, always a good time for diplomatic meetings. "So, what's the deal, Wachowiak? We've been waiting for hours. Communication troubles?"\n\n"No, no." Wachowiak was quiet, keeping his voice low. "I've been in contact with Warsaw just fine."\n\n"So what's the issue, then? We can schedule another session-" A drop of fear struck the bottom of Schmidt's gut, a slowly rising tide of worry.\n\n"No, no, Schmidt. It's over. They've left the conference. We're to go home effective immediately. The treaty is unacceptable."\n\nSchmidt's gut shot into his throat, and he choked on his next words. This couldn't happen to him. He couldn't have failed like this. He had wrangled so many things in line, pushed so many things his way, all for nothing? Visions of his face plastered as a scapegoat and fool across every paper in Germany shot through his mind like a bullet. Oh, god, what would Speer say? He'd put all his trust behind Schmidt's idea of a peaceful reconciliation. Now that it had fallen apart, would he ever listen to Schmidt again? Would he ever even try to negotiate again? Schmidt's plans fell apart in front of him as he struggled for words, struggled for air.\n\n"Stanislaw, you can't do this to me!" he shouted, but Stanislaw was already gone, the door shutting behind him. Schmidt was left alone, with only his furious, incredulous, terrified thoughts to keep him company."
speerpoland.18.a:0 "A travesty!"

speerpoland.19.t:0 "Ending a Farce"
speerpoland.19.d:0 "The Generalgouvernement of Poland had looked like a shiny jewel to the Rest of the Reich. When revolts had erupted all over Poland, however, Hans Frank's administration was revealed for what it was: a giant castle of lies, built on foundations of bribery and falsification of public reports. Everyone had thought such an inefficient and corrupt regime would have been crushed by the rage of the Polish resistance that had been festering in Poland's purulent bureaucracy and society for decades, but instead, Frank managed to resist the onslaught, whether due to bribes, ruthless repression or simply a stroke of luck.\n\nNow, however, a new regime rules in Germania, one which can no longer tolerate such a shameful conduct. Frank will be brought in front of a court, and his administration will be disbanded in favor of one more capable of serving Germany's interests... and perhaps even Poland's, should this be in our plans. The problem is, the cur knows what awaits him once he is relieved of his office, and refuses to submit, denying our Führer's legitimate claim to the mantle of Hitler's heir.\n\nTo address this issue, Feldmarschall von Tresckow has planned a quick and decisive military action, aimed at securing Poland and bringing Frank to justice. Our troops will cross the border and disarm the security forces of the Generalgouvernement: little resistance is expected as they have little in the way of numbers and equipment, especially with the Polish resistance keeping most of them constantly overstretched. The time to end this farce has long since been due, and now is the perfect time to draw the curtain."
speerpoland.19.a:0 "Frank will pay for his crimes."

speerpoland.20.t:0 "Hans Frank Surrenders!"
speerpoland.20.d:0 "As expected, the Generalgouvernement couldn't face the military might of the Wehrmacht, crippled by the Bürgerkrieg as it may be. The garrison offered mostly a token resistance before surrendering unconditionally, and our troops quickly converged on Warsaw: there, Hans Frank was already preparing to flee the country, but his retreat towards the airport was cut by an elite commando, and he was forced to capitulate when faced with the prospect of summary execution. Within a few hours, the few loyalists still fighting either dropped their weapons or were defeated by the Heer's crushing superiority.\n\nThe Generalgouvernement has been disbanded, and replaced by a provisory military administration that will ensure a return to normalcy. Our inspectors have already scoured Frank's archives, both public and secret, finding more than enough evidence of his crimes - bribery, embezzlement, falsification of public documents, treason, the list is very long - to permanently seal his fate, but the final choice rests in Speer's hands: should he be executed for his treasonous conduct, or merely imprisoned for life? Both choices would satisfy the population, but each will appeal to one of the currents within the government."
speerpoland.20.a:0 "Frank will meet the hangman."
speerpoland.20.b:0 "Imprisonment will suffice."

 speerbohemia.1.t:0 "Approaching the Bohemians"
 speerbohemia.1.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nThe Reich has long considered Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren to be one of the most successful Germanization projects. As you know, the purpose of the Protektorat is to pacify the local population, and, through the various means available to them, make it so that they are either phased out for ethnic Germans, or educated to the point that we can call them proper Aryans. It has mainly been the second, and it has been a great success at that. The Protektorat, then, has succeeded in its objective; I would consider it now to be a viable territory to be annexed directly into the glorious Reich. I am hopeful that you understand my reasoning for this, Herr Lutz, and that you will comply with my request, which I am certain would not come as a major difficulty for you. Your service has been valuable, and now the next step must be taken.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n- Führer Speer"

 speerbohemia.2.d:0 "This letter is to be addressed to the current Führer Albert Speer.\n\nI greet you warmly, dear Führer, leader of the Reich, the thousand-year Empire, the eagle that soars above Europa. I would gladly accept entry into Germania, seeing as how my leadership of this Protektorat has led to it being established as almost entirely Germanized. There is, however, one issue that remains which both you and I must confront. There has been an issue going around-- a very strange one, at that. We both know of the SS, the cancer that manifests itself as Ordensstaat Burgund, but also as smaller tumors that spread across Europe. They have spread here, too, but fortunately the Czech Guard has, under the leadership of Rudolf Toussaint, beaten back this nest of degeneracy. For that, Rudolf has called for a special proposal to be made. For their efforts, he desires for the Czechs to immediately be recognized as honorary Aryans. My Führer, it is only with you would I have even bothered sending this proposal back to you, for you are an understanding leader. It is my hope that you can accept this compromise in order for the Protektorat to be now and forever be fully integrated into the Reich.\n\nHeil!\n\n- Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk"

 speerbohemia.3.t:0 "An Ultimatum to the Bohemians"
 speerbohemia.3.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nI must bring you unfortunate news. The idea that the Czechs must be turned into honorary Aryans has not been received well in Germania. They may have spilt blood to protect their territory, yes, but they are subservient to the Reich first. They must learn its culture and its ways, they must learn the language, and they must learn that to become a German, you must know what it is to be a German. Anything else would be a disapproving notion of the Germanization process. I'm certain you understand then, Herr Lutz, when I tell you that my asking of the Protektorat to become a part of the Reich is no longer a request. It is a demand. This is, unfortunately, how things must go. I will give you a period of 72 hours to respond. If you do not respond in this time, the consequences will be drastic.\n\nHeim ins Reich, Herr Lutz.\n\n- Führer Speer"
 speerbohemia.3.a:0 "Pray that they accept."

 speerbohemia.4.t:0 "The Annexation of Bohemia"
 speerbohemia.4.d:0 "Dear Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk,\n\nAfter considering your proposal for quite some time, I have come to achieve a resolution. While it may be slightly unbefitting for the Czechs to become Aryans on the spot, doing so would solve a multitude of our problems. As is the case right now, I cannot stand to comment on the actions of the Schutzstaffel in the Protektorat, but I can assure you that no foreign element will commit any sort of subversion in the territory. With this out of the way, I can congratulate your service for the Reich, Herr Lutz, and you will be rewarded generously in helping Germania expand its dominion to rightfully include all proper Germans, and honorary Aryans, into its home. That is all I shall be writing in this letter. The rest will come naturally, as we can finally say that this chapter of Protektorat Böhmen und Mähren is closed.\n\n- Führer Speer"

 speerbohemia.5.t:0 "The Bohemians Refuse"
 speerbohemia.5.d:0 "Speer paid it little thought-- they would accept. Obviously they would. What other choice could they possibly have?! But as the minutes turned into hours turned into days, his anxiety grew and grew. There was a mild annoyance for him after the first twenty-four hours, which turned into a bothering feeling that plagued him for another twenty-four hours, and once the final day had begun, it manifested into Speer pacing in his office, waiting, just waiting, for someone to come through and hand him a note. That they would say, "My Führer, you've received a letter from Reichsprotektorat Lutz," and then bid him a crisp salute before hurrying off.\n\nBut that moment of reprieve never came. Instead, the bell had struck midnight, and Speer almost drew blood from biting in his fingertip as the last seconds of peace slipped past him. Now he had an issue to deal with. Not a big one militarily, but it would show itself to the rest of the world as a glaring hole in Mitteleuropa. If he couldn't peacefully annex one of the most integrated subjects of the Reich, what would that say for all the others? That question crossed his mind many times as he began to draw up a plan of action."

 speerbohemia.7.d:0 "This letter is to be addressed to the current Führer Albert Speer.\n\nThese past three days have been worrisome, my Führer. Ever since I have received your letter, there has been chaos in the government. Panic struck many of our people, but I can say for certain that I have kept a clear head in these times. Immense pressure has been put on me from Rudolf to continue negotiating these terms. Eventually, however, I forced his hand and he had to back down after a fierce argument we've recently had. I write this letter to you now regarding the concerns between the Reich and the Protektorat with a simple sentence.\n\nWe accept.\n\n- Reichsprotektor Lutz Graf Schwerin Von Krosigk"
 speerbohemia.7.a:0 "I only hope you receive this letter in time."

 speerbohemia.8.t:0 "The Madmen Over the Mountains"
 speerbohemia.8.d:0 "Speer sat around in his office, cross-legged, frustrated, looking at his desk at a stack of papers while rubbing two fingers against his forehead. He wasn't really unaware about the circumstances facing Bohemia. In fact, he was fully aware that the SS, puppets of Himmler's insanity, had planted themselves into the Protektorat and had gone so far as to openly begin clashing with the German loyalists there. He was not expecting them to win, no, even if they were expertly trained, they were outnumbered, outgunned, and they had the resistance of the local populace. But something unexpected happened.\n\nThey did win.\n\nAnd now Speer had to deal with the issue of SS Bohemia staring down the barrel of the Empire. With casualties and destruction certain to follow, the whole process was something he wasn't exactly enthusiastic about. All Speer could hope for was that the ensuing conflict would be quick and relatively bloodless.\n\nSeveral minutes later, an old man came into Speer's office, dressed in full military uniform, seemingly ready to head into combat. Speer had, obviously, recognized who this figure was. "Tresckow," he began, catching the man's attention as Speer leaned forward. "I'll make this quick. I'll be on my way to hold a speech in Vienna. While I'm gone, I'll have to ask you to organize the troops and send them to the border. You've already been briefed on the situation, so I assume you needn't ask twice about dealing with the SS."\n\nTresckow shook his head. "Regardless of the feelings I have for them, my Führer," he began, "Their resistance to entering the Reich will be met with a swift response. It's the only reasonable thing to do." The pride in his voice made Speer nod weakly, letting out a sigh as he waved his hand. "Yes, yes. I understand what you're trying to say. Now leave me be. I need to sort these papers out.""
 speerbohemia.8.a:0 "The will of the Reich cannot be ignored."

 speerbohemia.9.t:0 "Striking the Barracks"
 speerbohemia.9.d:0 "That morning began with a crack that ruptured through the barracks. A gunshot that signified the beginning of the shift; he wasted no time at all in getting ready. In a minute he had gotten his uniform prepared - in another he obtained and loaded both his rifle and his sidearm, and in another he was standing shoulder to shoulder with his brothers all dressed in black. All in perfect order, as it should be, as it must be. Now he would continue to service the cause, and a gratitude of the continuation of this fact filled his mind for a moment, only for it to be just as quickly perished-- no emotion must linger too long.\n\nThe sharp cut through the air of a voice brought the soldier front and center into reality as the situation made itself clear and clarified in a moment's time. The degenerate Reich found itself trigger-happy to declare war against them for the sole purpose of being loyal to Ordenstaadt Burgund rather than the all-encompassing Empire that threatened their sovereignty. They had not earned this right, he would think, they would not step a foot in this land without proving themselves to be the low scum that they claimed to be otherwise.\n\nAnd so as the orders were barked out in meticulous order, boots marched across the floor of the barracks to prepare themselves for the eventual march outwards. He felt killing intent in his hands as he entered an armory designated for machine-gunners, and as he laid eyes upon a buzzsaw that would cut through rotten Aryan blood like a scythe through a field."
 speerbohemia.9.a:0 "A cacophony of noise and explosions followed."

 speerbohemia.10.t:0 "To Prevent Terror"
 speerbohemia.10.d:0 "Vienna was empty that day. Or, at least, it was cleared out of citizens. Considering the enemy the Reich was about to take on, it wasn't sure just what exactly this SS force was capable of, even if everyone assumed that they would be quickly crushed. Either way, Speer had paved way to make a speech, just as he had said before to Tresckow, who seemed to have sortied the army efficiently to the borders. Now he had to rile up the troops to fight their own. Not too difficult, he hoped, considering that who they were fighting was, well...\n\n"Soldiers of the Reich!" He began, "There is a festering abomination just beyond these borders. I am unwilling to name the beast that wanders from land to land, spreading an ideology that only serves to corrupt and destroy the lands and men it touches!" A resounding agreement came from the soldiers. They knew of the Black State and its disgusting off-branch of "supremacy" that amounted to nothing but insanity. "That is why I implore you, as citizens of Germany, to see this threat in the Protektorat as an obstacle to unification and nothing more! The SS there will be quashed under our jackboot, and no mercy will be given to its adherents. Strike hard, quickly, and annihilate them!"\n\nSpeer could see it, clearly, that these men listening to him regarded the SS as more ideological foes of the Reich than a beast in the making. Whatever justification to butcher these vermin would be, it didn't matter to him, so long as the influence of Himmler was contained to his feudal playground and nothing more."
 speerbohemia.10.a:0 "The Protektorat shall join us soon enough."

 speerbohemia.11.t:0 "Marching on Prague"
 speerbohemia.11.d:0 "Noise - that's what it was. So much noise had polluted the city when the war began. From the SS moving in and doing what the SS does, ranging from executing those who refused to fully cooperate with them to immediately beginning preparations of turning the city into a death trap. They did not have much time on their hands, owing it to the fact that the forces of the Reich, gutless as they were, still fought on the cult of speed and combined arms. And so it was that when they finally arrived, trucks chugging into highways, planes dotting the sky, and boots stomping against gravel, did the SS spring their trap. Explosions rocked one street corner after another, filling entire sections of Prague with dust and smog, while gunfire rained down from above barred apartments and abandoned shops.\n\nThe fighting was grueling, to say the least. Every inch the Heer took, the agents of Himmler would make sure that it was paid dearly, either in blood spilled or buildings laying themselves bare and crippled after the SS exhausted their defensive capability. It was before the sun had fully set, nearing the edge of darkness, when Prague found a vague semblance of peace overtake the majority of the city. The destruction had not been severe enough to warrant a crisis, but a rebuilding program would need to be begun, and many heartfelt letters were sorely needed back in the homeland. Even still, the menace was driven out of the capital, which proved an effective end to the terror plaguing the Protektorate."

 ## Danish Events ##
 speerdenmark.1.t:0 "Approaching the Danes"
 speerdenmark.1.d:0 "Speer had always found it a little annoying, if he was to be openly honest about it, that this small nation of not much significance stood tall above the Reich, retaining its full independence and colours on any map printed out. Not only could they be easily swayed to join the Pakt, but he could make a strong case on why they would only benefit such a thing, being close Aryan brothers and having no real land disagreements.\n\nThe idea would be twofold. First, Speer would offer the Danish government a small helping hand upon entering the Pakt, so they could ease themselves in and be comfortable amid the rest of the Reich's allies.\n\nSecond, he would hold a speech that would be televised to viewers home and abroad, where he would testify to the strength of the Reich and the solitary situation the Danish found themselves, which, if they accepted the help of their Aryan brothers below, is something that would be easily rectified.\n\nNow, all that remained was to begin planning."
 speerdenmark.1.a:0 "They will return home."

 speerdenmark.2.t:0 "The Carrot and the Stick"
 speerdenmark.2.d:0 "There was nothing particularly outstanding about Denmark, he thought, once Speer had looked over the economic analysis of the country. Nothing at all that really made it especially valuable besides being another source for manpower and labor to feed into the Reich. That wasn't the concern here, however, even if Speer considered the Danes to be easy candidates for Germanization. They were to become allies first, and anything else would come afterwards.\n\nA short and direct economic plan was drafted up, which would give the Danes small, temporary privileges upon entering the Reich. This would take up a small portion of the Reich's budget, and perhaps annoy the other subjects of the Pakt slightly for favoring them like this, but continuing to consecrate rule across Europa would only benefit everyone involved."
 speerdenmark.2.a:0 "Now onto the next step."

 speerdenmark.3.t:0 "They're Nothing Without Us"
 speerdenmark.3.d:0 "Speer couldn't understand how some men could hold speeches that lasted for so long about such trivial things. This, chiefly, was one of those trivial things. He was already so close in convincing them to join that he was almost visibly annoyed with dragging it out with the Danes by the time he had to begin to address the people listening.\n\nThere was a short interlude whereupon a presenter introduced the many titles of the Führer, inciting roaring applause from the audience that was present, before the man nodded towards Speer as he let him take the stand.\n\n"To the people of Denmark, listen to what I have to say next. I wish to call upon you a simple fact - a statement that cannot be ignored, an issue that cannot be resolved, a bothersome idea that trails behind your every footstep." Speer took a deep breath.\n\n"You are alone. In this reshaping of the New World Order, you are alone."\n\n"All of your troubles, your loneliness, your vulnerability, this will leave you only as prey for greater powers willing to ruin you, bring you down into the sinking depths of history. But we are your Germanic brothers. We are your neighbours, the ones from across the river that shall bid you a warm greeting. We, the men of the Reich, are here for you. Like a man fumbling in the raging river, drowning and calling for help, we will come to you and lend you a hand. And with a mighty Germanic grip, we will pull you out, to the safety of the world, and we will call you a friend of ours."\n\n"Come, Denmark, for the thousand-year Reich shall soar with the rest of Europa on its wings.""
 speerdenmark.3.a:0 "I see how they hold speeches about trivial things, now."

 speerdenmark.4.t:0 "Welcome Home"
 speerdenmark.4.d:0 "Speer let out a sigh of relief. What else was he expecting to happen, really? Considering the geopolitical position of the Danes, there really was only one option left for them to take. The other would leave them stranded and alone, ripe for the taking. As he silently read the letter through in his office, a small, satisfied smile came to his lips. They had agreed, and over the course of the next month, Denmark would begin its entry into the Pakt. Seems like his Germanic rhetoric had worked after all, and the money boost certainly convinced the more pragmatic-minded Danes in their cabinet. The economy of the Einheitspakt would see a small, but noticeable, increase in its wealth, and the maps of Europa printed out in the future could finally shade that small blotch of land in as belonging to the Reich's sphere of influence."
 speerdenmark.4.a:0 "With this taken care of, Speer turns to other issues."

 speerdenmark.5.t:0 "The Extremists to the North"
 speerdenmark.5.d:0 "Damnation! While this wasn't the worst case scenario, it certainly came close to it. With the Hardliners now having a stranglehold on Denmark, there would certainly be no way to introduce them into the Pakt, seeing Speer's position as Führer to be a betrayal of their original values. Whatever they were planning, they had to be stopped and quickly brought under the wing of the Reich. Which is why he had to call for a certain... someone.\n\n"My Führer- it is a pleasure that I have been called to your office," the man in front of Speer spoke, standing tall and straight with a smile on his face. He put a hand out, and they both shook strongly before letting go.\n\n"I have a feeling you already know what I am about to tell you, Herr Reinhardt," Speer spoke, turning around and taking a few steps forwards to his desk.\n\n"I suppose I do, my Führer. This concerns Denmark, doesn't it?" The spymaster spoke, which confirmed Speer's suspicions. He didn't need to respond as his compatriot continued. "I will not speak on the topic of the ideology that has overtaken their government, but I can assure you that this will be an unusual operation." Speer could tell that Reinhardt was hiding something. Distaste, maybe? It didn't matter to him - they were National Socialists that would not compromise, and thus a threat to be destroyed.\n\n"There are already agents in place. What would you like me to do with them?" The response was obvious, but he wanted Speer to announce it for him.\n\n"Set them up for a coup. Your men... this operation will be risky, and if they're caught, they will likely face trial for their crimes. Anything less than treason against the state followed by execution would be a miracle."\n\nReinhardt sighed, but did nothing more. The Führer could tell that the spymaster was getting impatient, and so he turned to face the man with a dismissive hand wave. "You are free to go. This operation is effective immediately."
 speerdenmark.5.a:0 "There will be no compromise with the Danish."

 speerdenmark.6.t:0 "Men on the Inside"
 speerdenmark.6.d:0 "The radio on the man's desk crackled to life as he approached it, and, sitting down, placed the headphones on his head. The shot of static made him flinch slightly, but the voice that followed afterwards gave him a smile."\n\n"Wilhelm, my friend!" He greeted boisterously, prompting the radio operator to turn down the volume. "How have you been, serving the Reich yonder over the border? I've just been spending my time walking around Copenhagen, monitoring patrols and vehicles. It's not hard work, no, but I assume you've called me for a change of plans, eh?" he laughed.\n\nWilhelm sighed softly. Could he let the man speak? It's almost as if he wasn't needed here. "Yes, Frederick I know what you've been doing recently-- it's my job to keep track of the agents in Denmark. Including you."\n\nThe static crackled back in with another bout of laughter. "That's the fighting spirit," Frederick commented. "Look, I've been seeing someone muck about in a pastry shop I've been frequenting recently. They seem sort of kept to themselves, but I can spot a proper Aryan when I see one! So tell me, is that who I'm--"\n\n"Yes, yes it is." The dull, almost defeated voice cut in. "If Headquarters is hearing this, they will have my neck. We are supposed to be disciplined, so I will give you your orders. Are you listening carefully?"\n\nSilence followed for several seconds afterwards.\n\n"Right then. That man you mentioned... you are to meet him. His name is Oscar Blecher. Greet him with the phrase 'I wish to buy you a Lager, my friend', and he will recognize you right away as a man of the Reich. From then onwards, you are to follow his instructions. Is this clear?"\n\nAgain, silence dominated the radio frequency for a few seconds before Wilhelm spoke up, voice having sombered up. "Yes Bordfunker Wilhelm. I can assume, then, that this is where the operation will begin?"\n\n"If you succeed, we will be able to topple the SS without having to fire a single shot. If not, then-"\n\n"Then nothing!" Wilhelm cut in joyously. "Don't worry about what will or will not happen. I hold no ill will towards the National Socialists here - but they stand in the way of the Reich. In toppling this resistance, I'm doing my service to the Führer. You have other things to tend to, my friend, I'm sure. Goodbye, Bordfunker Wilhelm."

 speerdenmark.7.t:0 "Subverting Their Will"
 speerdenmark.7.d:0 "Frederick's pistol fit snugly in his coat as he felt the groove of the barrel while walking through the streets of Copenhagen. He dressed in civilian clothing, naturally, though made sure to wear thick enough clothing to conceal the weapon he was carrying with him. As he looked upon a small band of armed soldiers walking across a narrow street, he stopped up for a moment, glancing at the rifles in their hands for a moment before swiftly turning his head away. He hoped, he thought, he well and truly hoped that he didn't stand out as an oddity in these empty streets as he took the opportunity to scan his surroundings once more. Seeing now that there were no soldiers in this small section of Copenhagen, he dashed into a nearby alleyway, footsteps pounding against concrete that softened into blades of grass and dirt.\n\n"Herr... Frederick?" A voice called out in the darkness. He could recognize who it was. Or, rather, who they were.\n\n"I'm glad you recognized me. Was it my hair?" The sarcasm in his voice was annoyingly audible as a gang of three showed themselves. All three of them seemed heavily armed though lightly armored, carrying zhdanovs, grenades, each with a set of pistols, and one of them having a submachine gun.\n\n"No, Herr Frederick," spoke the one with the largest weapon, a heavy Danish accent tinting his German. "Nobody would willingly go into this alleyway alone."\n\nHe rolled his eyes. "Of course they wouldn't! I was only making a joke! I..." Frederick sighed as his comedy routine fell flat. "Well, all humor aside, I suppose you gentlemen are here to parley with me. I know we are not friends, certainly, but I am under the orders of my Führer to help your resistance activities. I believe you will find my expertise to be most... exciting, if I may say."\n\n"Yeah?" One of them chimed in. "And you have to offer us what exactly?"\n\nThe German chuckled heartily. "I am not a man of firearms."

 speerdenmark.8.d:0 "He swore he could feel his entire body shaking from that one. Well - it didn't matter now, did it?\n\n"Herr Frederick, if I may be so curious as to ask," came the voice of a man that was nearly drowned out by gunfire, "did the bastard Aryans hire you because they saw your potential, or because you bombed the nearest barr-"\n\nIn speaking of bombs, two pairs of eyes spotted something distinctly hand-grenade-shaped coming their way, with both men giving all their strength to jump the hell away from where it would land. Frederick managed to get himself behind an empty oil barrel, while his other friend, who he came to know as Albert, took cover behind a shot-up, deflated truck. The German could tell when the explosion came when he felt a lack of noise and a presence of ringing in his ears both occurring at the same time, which he took as an opportunity to dust himself off and grip the pistol in his hand properly, turning back around and meeting up with Albert once again.\n\n"All of this just for our country to be handed over to the bloody Aryan," the other man spit out, glaring fiercely. "Shedding the blood of my countrymen... I thought I would be doing this for democracy."\n\nFrederick grinned. "Look at it this way, my Danish friend- we coup your country, we install a vague semblance of democracy. You enter the Pakt, you prosper from it. It's so simple, I hardly doubt anyone would say no to it."\n\nAlbert audibly grumbled at that last part, only being stopped from speaking by being forced to duck his head under a shower of gunfire.\n\nThe conversation stopped for a few seconds to let the noise calm down enough for someone to actually be audible. "I hate this," Albert growled.\n\n"Don't look at me like that!" Frederick responded with fake concern. "Come on...""
 speerdenmark.8.a:0 "At least we're getting rid of the Hardliners for you."

 speerdenmark.9.t:0 "The Coup Fails"
 speerdenmark.9.d:0 "Frederick finally found himself some peace and quiet. In this abandoned-out building, he could rest for just a little bit. As he entered a room, he noticed that there was an abandoned sniper sitting perched up on a window, obviously aiming outside. His eyes widened and also shined when he spotted the weapon, even letting out a small 'ooh' as he approached it. Examining it carefully, he could see what it was. And the results were outstanding - it was a vintage weapon! Even more than that, it was a modified vintage weapon. The Karabiner 98 kurz with a scope mounted on top. Frederick was no marksman, but if this plan went successfully, then he could perhaps take this and keep it for himself as a reward for his service when he returned home. Though, he hadn't heard from his allies outside in a while, he was certain that everything would go alright.\n\nThat was, until he heard the soft sound of footsteps behind him. Frederick froze in place; he recognized the distance immediately, and it was not one that he would risk turning around for. Instead, he opted to slowly raise his arms up in the air, closing his eyes for a short while and taking a deep breath. The voice that came afterwards he only understood in fragments, but he didn't have to translate it. "German," he said, "I am a German. I don't understand Danish," he continued, and there was nothing in response for a second or two afterwards, which made the anxiety in his stomach grow heavier. Then, he heard a sigh, and another pair of footsteps. "You are coming with me, Aryan." It was slow, broken up and paced awkwardly, but it would make do. "Trial for treason."\n\nFrederick bit his lower lip. What the hell was he to do now except hand himself over? There was something, at least - a question that burned in his mind that he wanted answered before the inevitable came. "What has happened to the others outside?" A quick, cruel laughter came to meet his question. "Idiotic Aryan. Is it not clear?""
 speerdenmark.9.a:0 "You have failed your mission. Now, come, with the rest of the scum."

 speerdenmark.10.t:0 "Formalizing The Ultimatum"
 speerdenmark.10.d:0 ""To the people of Denmark..."\n\nSpeer crossed one leg over the other and stared at the typewriter. How was he going to formulate this... ? "The situation has turned dire." He was to emphasize the danger the Danes were putting themselves in. Something about how the mistake they have made was grave, but in a way that showed strength, not desperation. "The Reich is unafraid to show why it is the Master of Europa." That would certainly catch their attention. Furthermore, he had to showcase that there is no degeneracy plaguing Germania. After all, if he wanted them to join the Pakt as well, he wanted to get them on their good side. And so...\n\n"... Ever since our magnificent victory so long ago, we have established a Reich that would last for generations to come. This is unprecedented in history. The empires of old - the Achaemenids, the Romans, the Francians, the British, they all share one fatal flaw in common. They relied on the strength of their arms, not on the strength of their people. We, however, are unified in our cause. It is, therefore, imperative that your people understand their position."\n\nHere Speer took a gamble.\n\n"The Reich's strength is unparalleled, its discipline unrivalled, and we do not wish to bring the full might of the Wehrmacht upon your nation. It would only bring ruin. Instead, we demand that you do two things. First, you will release every man related to the attempted coup in Copenhagen. They will be guaranteed safety, whether German or Danish, from any acts of violence against them. Secondly, the nation of Denmark will enter the Einheitspakt, and will be treated as any regular member. Your opportunity to join as a special member has passed. Now there is only one choice to be made.""
 speerdenmark.10.a:0 "For the Danish Volk, I hope you make the correct choice."

 speerdenmark.11.t:0 "Denmark Refuses"
 speerdenmark.11.d:0 "Frederick was restrained from head to toe - not only did he have cuffs on, he also had a see-through bag on his head. Really, he thought, this was absurd. Admittedly he had only seen one trial in-person, and that was for a theft of goods in his hometown. The court wasn't nearly as grand as this, and nor was the judge as loud as the one he heard beforehand. He could barely understand what he was hearing, either, but the sinking feeling he had would tell him everything he needed to know. Here and there, while uncomfortably shuffling in his seat, he could hear the judge yelling out words like 'treason', 'betrayal', 'court', and probably a couple of swears here and there. The lump in his throat grew bigger as time passed, and a few questions were wandering his mind. Mainly, how long this whole charade would take. He thankfully had no family to worry about when he would eventually be dug into a ditch, but still, the idea of execution did not sound nice to him.\n\nThe slam of a gavel rang in his ears after two entire hours passed, and Frederick let out a breath he didn't realize he was keeping in for so long. Being roughly picked up by two guards, he felt a tremor go down his back. Shit - this was really happening, wasn't it? He was about to be brought out to the back to be executed like a dog, by people whose ideology he could share common ground with. A National Socialist executing another National Socialist. Frederick could only muster a shaky grin to himself as he closed his eyes, sending out a prayer to whatever deity was watching that some freak accident would happen.\n\nHe grunted when his body hit the dirt, and grit his teeth when he gave a single attempt at trying to break free of his restraints. There was too much ringing in his mind to hear whatever the hell was going outside of the confines of the bag on his head, and his uneven breaths bothered him. What did he say before? That he was an agent of the Reich? That he would lay his life down on the line? Well, now he was, in the most literal sense possible. Frederick found that a bit ironic, actually. So ironic that his lips parted as teeth bared themselves.\n\nToo bad he never got the time to let out a chuckle."
 speerdenmark.11.a:0 "It seems that the Danish have denied the ultimatum."

 speerdenmark.12.t:0 "Denmark Accepts"
 speerdenmark.12.d:0 "Frederick felt groggy in this cell. Perhaps it was the significantly different change of pace that he was used to. Perhaps it was the fact that he was stripped of all his pride down to prisoner's clothing. And it might just be the fact that he was about to get sent to his death. Who knows? Frederick sure as hell didn't, stuck in here and unable to hear news from the rest of the world. By the time the next morning came, he felt hungry, thirsty, and sure as hell annoyed. He knew how this trial would conclude, so what was taking them so long?\n\nThe answer came in the form of a knock on his cell that caught his attention.\n\n"Herr Frederick," the man in the uniform said, drawing each syllable out.\n\n"Yes, what is it? Am I finally getting the bullet? Or am I reaching the chamber first before that happens?" He sarcastically bit back, standing up to his feet and staring at what looked like to be his jailer.\n\n"No, Herr Frederick. You are getting released."\n\n"What?"\n\n"You heard me correctly. You are being released. Do I have to repeat this to you again?"\n\n"No... you don't." He wasn't willing to admit it openly, but a massive weight was lifted from his shoulders when he heard that he wasn't about to go six feet under. "Why, however?"\n\nThe jailor stared at him with a mixture of boredom and disgust. "Your Führer has, to put it bluntly, threatened to invade our nation if we did not release you all and join your Pakt." He could almost feel the sneering expression from here. "I hope you are happy. Now," he began, plugging a key into the entrance. "Get out." He finished, emphasizing it with a click as the door opened.\n\nWith a massive grin that was quickly tempered by his want to not get beaten up by the guard, Frederick walked out feeling like a new man. Though, something crossed his mind when he took the first step beyond bars."
 speerdenmark.12.a:0 "Can I keep the Karabiner I found... ?"

 speerdenmark.13.t:0 "The Coup Succeeds"
 speerdenmark.13.d:0 "Being in full uniform while laying down in an apartment bed was uncomfortable, Frederick noted. It was especially uncomfortable when he made the unwise decision of dragging cigarette smoke out of his mouth, resulting in a quick coughing fit as he struggled to sit up straight. Even after participating in open rebellion, nearly getting a bullet lodged into his brain, and explosions rocking him so hard he's likely going to lose his hearing by the time he was in his sixties, the German almost succumbed on the spot to one stupid decision. "The things that happen in life," he coughed out, mumbling to himself while he stared down at the wooden floor below. "That wouldn't have gotten me any medal of honor. Now where the hell-"\n\nThe banging on the door riddled with bullet holes made him jump in fright, reaching for his pistol and only stopping when he heard his native tongue being spoken. "Herr Frederick?" The voice called out. "Your car has arrived. I would suggest leaving immediately, as it would be best if we don't risk some rogue agent shooting up your vehicle." That made him crack a smile as he got up. He still kept the pistol at his side, however, just to be on the safe side. "I hope the Danes are not terrified of me when I step out.", "No, they-- Come on, Herr Frederick, if you want to be applauded for your efforts, you'll have time for it during the trip back to Germania.", "Fine, fine."\n\nDriving through the streets of Copenhagen now, once the violence had settled, felt strange to him. Surrounding the center of the city, Frederick could see clearly the aftereffects of what happened. Bloodied and burnt bodies with emptied-out weapons would be a common sight, with some places being warzones that he himself had to pass through. "So then, once I come home I believe I can safely say that I will be duly rewarded for my efforts," Frederick proudly spoke, staring out the car window while he talked. "The Führer will be most pleased to hear this news, after all, and I could see myself earning a raise in pay. Hmm... the possibilities." He turned to the driver who kept his focus narrow on the road. "Hey, what do you think will happen when I come home? Maybe they'll let me keep a souvenir gun at home? Ooh, I love bolt-action rifles. The noise they make when they shoot is so satisfying, and the click of the bolt...""
 speerdenmark.13.a:0 "The road back was long and arduous. Except for Frederick."

 ## Holland Events
 speerholland.1.t:0 "Meeting with the Dutch"
 speerholland.1.desc:0 "There is much reason for Germany to rejoice, with the civil war over, and the heart of the Reich secured under the banner of its new leader, Albert Speer. For the reunification of the Volk, however, there remain many battles still to be won. The Germanic people of Europe are divided, scattered across the continent, a stark contrast to Hitler's grand alliance system, and a definite liability to the new regime in Germania. To the west, Germany's brothers in Holland have yet to rejoin the Pakt, leaving both the Vaterland and the Netherlands in a precarious position.\n\nFor the new Führer, and Foreign Minister Schmidt, reentry of Holland has become a diplomatic priority, and negotiations with [HOL.GetLeader] and the rest of the Hague are being planned. Within Speer's cabinet, there is much uncertainty about the coming meeting, but on the outside, Germany's head of state is all smiles and waves for the people. He reaffirmed this confidence to the public before he and his plane departed from Germania, ensuring the Völkischer Beobachter a quote for their headline:\n\n"The Dutch know where their blood belongs.""
 speerholland.1.a:0 "Gute Reise, mein Führer!"

 speerholland.2.t:0 "Germanic Brotherhood"
 speerholland.2.desc:0 "Was he certain once? He was certain he wasn't now. Decades under the doctrine of any belief can push the faith of any man, especially the smart ones, and, if anything, Speer certainly considered himself clever.\n\nIt was precisely this intelligence which commanded Speer to appeal to the Dutch reactionaries through race in his negotiations. In a speech to a collection of statesmen in the political capital of the Netherlands, the Führer connected the philosophical genius of the Dutch Descartes and Voetius, with the German Leibniz and Goethe. He connected the diplomatic centrality of the Hague with Bismarck's focus on alliances and peace. Both nations, Speer went on, shared a common history of honourable monarchies and fair republics, feudal states and global empires. Truly, there was a unique and profound link, at the level of blood, that connected the Dutch and the Germans in a genetic brotherhood. At this conclusion, a raucous applause erupted from the gathered crowd in the Binnenhof.\n\nSpeer wasn't certain about the Jews, but he was certain that Europe did have an inferior subhuman infesting it. The proud Aryans of Speer's homeland clung onto every word of Germanic superiority that emerged from their Führer's mouth. A million conservative ears, from Amsterdam to Danzig, fixated on his voice in their radios and television sets. Like pigs, the true untermenschen of the Reich lapped up Speer's lies."
 speerholland.2.a:0 "We're brothers in race."

 speerholland.3.t:0 "Wooing the Dutch"
 speerholland.3.desc:0 "It was in his negotiations that Speer realised he had underestimated the Dutch. Dealing with a nation built on foundational traditions of economic, diplomatic and trading expertise was not, he discovered, a walk in the park. To woo the Dutch, Speer (after some amount of stern lecturing and heated argumentation originating from one Ludwig Erhard) elected to offer them economic subsidies. Instead of the immediate acceptance he had hoped for, the German Führer was met with the smiling faces of the Dutch ministry, reliably followed by Erhard sending Speer a responsive glare. They demanded more. Much more.\n\nSpeer was faced with a decision. He could cave and hand the Dutch their favoured subsidies, which would curry favour in the Hague and guarantee them joining the Pakt, but harm both Germany's treasury and the Führer's legitimacy. On the other hand, Speer could refuse, try to call the Hague's bluff, while maintaining his image and his resources, but reducing the potential sympathies of the Netherlands for the Pakt, and certainly alienating Germany from Holland's favour"
 speerholland.3.a:0 "Accept their demands, pay the full subsidies."
 speerholland.3.b:0 "Call their bluff, make it clear what we're willing to give."

 speerholland.4.t:0 "An Agreement Reached"
 speerholland.4.desc:0 "Stern gazes and tight handshakes in the Hague today, as the Führer and the Netherlands have finally come to a compromise surrounding the matter of subsidies. Formalities abound, with [HOL.GetLeader] and Speer engaging in all the manners of true Germanic statesmen. An image of the two is to cover the front page of the Völkischer Beobachter, the leaders smiling, their arms around each other. It will make for a good headline and an excellent symbol for the renewed unity of the nations.\n\nThese are just the necessary appearances, however; neither the Dutch nor the Germans are entirely pleased with the outcome. In any event, with an imperfect agreement reached, the negotiations are almost ready to conclude..."
 speerholland.4.a:0 "Politics is not an exact science."

 speerholland.5.t:0 "They Always Want More..."
 speerholland.5.desc:0 "Word from the Hague is that the Führer's scheme has failed. Outwitting the Dutch proved too much for Germania's new cabinet, and on top of this, Holland has demanded more than their initial subsidy request. With Erhard fuming, it looks like there is no choice for Speer but to concede defeat and agree with the new demands. The Netherlands are guaranteed to return into the fold once more, but at the loss of Germany's dignity, the treasury's wallet, and the Führer's eardrums, once Erhard is through with them."
 speerholland.5.a:0 "Gott verdammt!"

 speerholland.6.t:0 "Brothers in Arms"
 speerholland.6.desc:0 "After a long, and not in the slightest easy process, Holland has reentered the Pakt. Ceremonies are being held in Germania, the Hague, Amsterdam, and elsewhere across the two nations. The papers are decorated with messages of Aryan brotherhood, while the streets are adorned with the twin banners of the Prinsenvlag and the Swastika, flailing together in the wind.\n\nHolland and the Reich are now themselves flailing together in the wind. In a hostile world still haunted by Hitler's ghost, one more ally for the new Reich is far from taken for granted by the Führer. This new development has not saved him from the punishment of returning home, however. Erhard has developed quite the list of criticisms for the Führer's handling of the subsidy situation, with the plane from the Hague to Germania providing just enough time to go through them. Unlike his economic counterpart, Schmidt has little say on the matter for now.\n\nSpeer is scarcely paying attention to either. As the plane lifts off Dutch soil, the Führer stares out over the cityscape as it fades into the countryside. The old man sighs. One more nation, he thinks."
 speerholland.6.a:0 "Heims in Reich."

 speerholland.7.t:0 "The Madmen to the West"
 speerholland.7.desc:0 "In the absence of Germania's oversight, the Dutch have fallen into a particularly vile mode of governmental insanity. The Schutzstaffel have seized control of Holland, and have begun emulating the program of their brethren in Burgundy. In place of the old Reichkomissariat, the Himmlerite system has spread to cover the whole of the Low Countries. Speer was no thrall to the Nazi doctrine of the German heartland, and had moments of sincere doubt about the party's racial ideology. There was no doubt, however, that whatever the faults of the Reich, the wholesale slaughter and enslavement of good Germanic men and women being committed by the new Dutch regime were crimes of a uniquely wicked breed.\n\nKiesinger and Speer talk quietly with each other just outside the Reichstag's main hall. They are facing away from the rest of the cabinet, pointing and muttering about a piece of paper the Führer is gripping. His speech. The two old men exchange a glance of reassurance, before Kiesinger gives his leader a pat on the back, and follows Speer out in front of the crowd.\n\nSpeer took pride in the Volkshalle. It was a magnificent building, and the Führer considered it as much a symbol of his own expertise as the purported Volk it symbolised. He gazed out at the hundreds of faces that comprised the reichstag, placing his speech on the podium before him.\n\n"In our time of crisis," he began, "it seems our enemies have taken advantage of Germany's distracted might. The madmen to the West spread their tendrils, and if this cancer is left unchecked, it will form a malignant growth, the type that would fell lesser nations. We are not, however, a lesser nation. The German people will not fall silent while our brothers and sisters are murdered in Holland. As I speak, our brave Wehrmacht is moving across the Dutch border, and we will not halt until the Reich's flag flies over Amsterdam."
 speerholland.7.a:0 "And the gears of war will turn once more..."

 speerholland.8.t:0 "We've Got Work To Do"
 speerholland.8.desc:0 "Speer had promised a war and a war he had won. Like the Romans of old, Speer enjoys some form of a triumphal parade in Germania, as the citizens of his Reich celebrate victory over Holland. Speer was a reformist, perhaps, but that did not mean he could not appreciate the finer pleasures of a Führer.\n\nFor Speer, this celebration was momentary. The Reich now occupied foreign territory, but could not retain military oversight forever. The Dutch would have their nation back, reintegrated into the Pakt, and with a stronger bond to Germania than before. The Chancellery, the Volkshalle and the Hague are now moving in sync with unity of purpose. The long march to civilian rule in the Netherlands has begun."
 speerholland.8.a:0 "Nous Maintiendrons"

 speerholland.9.t:0 "A Propaganda Campaign"
 speerholland.9.desc:0 "Speer tapped his pen against his closed mouth, alone in the Chancellery office. The Führer's brow is furrowed. Holland is back in the Reich, yes, and the various ministries and state apparatus of Germany are working day-in-day-out in the reconstitution of the Netherlands. The land of the Dutch has been seized, but Speer knows that their hearts and minds are yet to be won. The Spartan ideology clouds their thoughts, and after any stint of SS rule, the citizenry may feel that their loyalties lie more in Ost-Paris than Germania.\n\nSpeer picks up the phone, and dials for Kiesinger. The tone fades into the Deputy Führer's familiar silvery tones. Speer speaks. "Kurt, I need you to rally some support in the Volkshalle. I want a propaganda campaign in Holland, in support of our government of course. Yes, posters, radio broadcasts, television shows, just get whatever you can get from the good folks in the party. You can do that? Thank you Kurt. Take care."\n\nThe Führer puts the phone down, and gazes out onto the Chancellery lawn."
 speerholland.9.a:0 "Peace is hell."

 speerholland.10.t:0 "Finding the Perfect Leadership"
 speerholland.10.desc:0 "The reports coming in from the Hague look promising. Holland's citizenry are giving growing approval in surveys across the country, notably a growing enthusiasm for the conduct of the Unity Pakt and confidence in the Netherlands' place inside it. The Volkshalle, of course, can barely contain its enthusiasm at the news. It seems that the propaganda campaign was a glowing success.\n\nRumour round the informed circles of Germania is that Schmidt and Speer are to meet in the Chancellery this afternoon. With the prospects looking better, the foreign minister and the Führer will be discussing who to nominate for leadership of the newly reintegrated low countries."
 speerholland.10.a:0 "How exciting!"

 speerholland.11.t:0 "A Return to Civilian Rule"
 speerholland.11.desc:0 "Even amongst the rough humanity presented by the Nazi party, Speer can always find a way. It was not just him, to be fair. The perfect leadership for Holland would not have been found without the help of Kiesinger and Schmidt, sure. Speer knew, however, that his vision had paved the way, and now with good men loyal to the Reich moving toward the Hague, Germania was one step closer towards its former glory.\n\nIn Holland, civilian government is slowly but surely being returned. The propaganda campaign and the leadership team have proved themselves remarkably. Now, as the military administration is dismantled, all traces of the SS have been removed. An operation successful, if the Führer did say so himself."
 speerholland.11.a:0 "Even Erhard can't deny that"

 ## Slovakian Events ##
 
 speerslovakia.1.t:0 "Gateway to the Balkans"
 speerslovakia.1.d:0 "To the South of Germany, bordering our territories in Schlesien and Mähren, lie the Carpathian Mountains. This great wall of rock caged the newly unified Hungary in the 9th Century, and before that had been the barrier that even the great Romans could not reach before being halted in their Eastern expansion. It is a bulwark, and a blight on our influence in the Balkans, and beyond.\n\nThere is a solution here, albeit a simple one. Winning over Slovakia would bypass the Carpathians and give the Reich a wider border with Hungary. Additionally, the reintegration of Slovakia into the Pakt would regain Germany an old ally, increasing our legitimacy in the eyes of both the public, and abroad. Considering this, the Führer has sent an ultimatum to Bratislava; rejoin the Pakt or face invasion."
 speerslovakia.1.a:0 "Seems an obvious choice."
 
 speerslovakia.2.t:0 "An Ultimatum from the North"
 speerslovakia.2.d:0 "Slovakia has received an envoy from the German foreign ministry; they are demanding that we either rejoin their Unity-Pakt or accept invasion. A damning choice if ever there was one.\n\nOn the one hand, we have little choice, with the German Heer far outweighing our own standing army and our extensive border with them allowing a swift invasion on their part. On the other, we would essentially be forfeiting much of our international sovereignty, both economic and political, and our population might not see eye to eye with us on choosing Germania's path."
 speerslovakia.2.a:0 "Cave to the beast. Better bloodless servitude than futile war."

 speerslovakia.4.t:0 "Bratislava Refuses"
 speerslovakia.4.d:0 "The fools in Slovakia have gone against Germania's gracious offer. Our diplomats have returned to Germania empty-handed; Slovakia intends on defying the Reich.

 ###Ostland events###
 speer.900.t:0 "The Rank And File"
 speer.900.d:0 "Ostland is secured once again, and even now our men began the arduous task of restoring order to the war-torn region. The new regime that has been put in place is already reporting record numbers of enemy combatants- either surrendering, engaging our forces, or being caught fleeing the country. Most importantly, however, is the question of what we do with the captured soldiers.\n\nThese men- soldiers who fought under the regime of Otto-Heinrich Drechsler- are predominantly lower-ranking officers, such as lieutenants and sergeants. However, these men have committed treason- a crime punishable with anything up to death. To try them as traitors would certainly drive our point home and shore up our positions, but would also deprive the Heer of experienced, loyal soldiers. Meanwhile, pardoning these men would weaken our case and benefit the reactionaries, but these men would certainly be useful within our ranks. The decision falls to Albert Speer."
 speer.900.a:0 "Pardon them. They're not the men responsible."
 speer.900.b:0 "No mercy for traitors."

 speer.901.t:0 "An Ally In The East?"
 speer.901.d:0 ""Meyer-Landrut won? Interesting." Speer rubbed his jaw in contemplation.\n\n"Indeed. While of course I'd hoped for this outcome I hadn't expected it. He's maintained that you were the best choice as Führer since his uprising began. No doubt he'll be eager to rejoin the Reich."\n\n"No doubt."\n\nSchmidt had expected more - wasn't Speer pleased? "With your permission I will send him an invitation to Germania. I'll handle the negotiations for Ostland's handover personally."\n\n"Yes... and no. I want to meet him myself, get the measure of the man." Another surprise."
 speer.901.a:0 "As you wish."

 speer.902.t:0 "The Eastern Question"
 speer.902.d:0 "By god, but Landrut could talk. Since his arrival in Germania he had been gushing to Speer about this reform and that, barely giving him a chance to get a word in edgeways. Albert preferred it that way however. It gave him a better chance to determine what sort of man he truly was - an idealist who believed in democracy, or a pragmatist choosing his words to obtain popular support. A dangerous element to be removed, or a man he could work with. His fingers toyed at the button beneath his desk as Landrut went on and on. A single push, and the guards outside would have Landrut in a cell within seconds. His advisors would be furious to find out he had arrested a reformist ally, but he could certainly do with some credit from the more conservative elements of the party. Landrut seemed to have noticed his contemplation, for he stopped his waffling for a moment. "Mein Führer? Is something wrong?""
 speer.902.a:0 "This idiot really believes what he says. Press the button."
 speer.902.b:0 "He can be trusted to act in his own self interest."

 speer.903.t:0 "A Disappointing Meeting"
 speer.903.d:0 ""Mein Führer? Is something wrong?" Speer was broken from his reverie when Landrut ceased his speech. Andreas had been expecting... well, he hadn't been quite sure, but he had expected some response to his plans. Surely the man would be champing at the bit to incorporate his ideas, some of the only truly reformist ideas in the Reich - apart from his own, of course. Instead, he had just listened.\n\n"My apologies Andreas, I simply have a lot on my mind. It is good to find a true ally in these trying times. I am grateful for your work in Ostland, and now that it has been restored to the Reich we can get to work with our plans."\n\nWith that the Führer clearly considered the meeting over, as he rose and extended his hand. Meyer-Landrut clasped it in a firm grip, and shook it with enthusiasm.\n\n"Of course - the Führer's work is never done. Heil Speer!" He extended his arm in salute. When there was no response, he opened the door, chastened.\n\nOutside the door were half a dozen hulking OrPo officers, each one with their eyes locked on Andreas. He gulped. Surely, he didn't warrant such measures? He did his best to ignore the fact that they had their hands on their holstered pistols, and made his way out."
 speer.903.a:0 "Why does it feel like I have cheated death?"

 speer.904.t:0 "Idealism is a Fool's Game"
 speer.904.d:0 ""Herr Meyer-Landrut, you are under arrest for treason against the acting Reichskommissar of Ostland."\n\nMeyer-Landrut's mouth hung agape as the doors behind Speer opened with a crash, and half a dozen OrPo agents stormed into the room. As he tried to rise, his head was instead slammed against the table and handcuffs forced onto his wrists.\n\n"Mein Führer, I don't understand? I thought you were -" Whatever he was about to say was cut off as a bag was forced over his head. As he was frogmarched from the room, Speer didn't spare him a glance, instead contemplating the glass in his hand. Another traitor dealt with."

The Reichskommissar grimaced and took Schmidt's hand before sitting.\n\n"Now, I assume you understand why we've called these negotiations. Germania is interested in returning Ostland into the Reich after our unfortunate separation. Are there any particular conditions your government is interested in?"\n\nStahlecker eyed the man opposite him carefully. "I would like to keep my position as Reichsminister in your new Ostland. And I would like immunity for my men. These are my requests."\n\n"One moment, Herr Stahlecker, I need to take a call."\n\nSpeer was on the other end of the line, and Schmidt relayed the information. The Führer and the foreign minister were faced with two choices. On the one hand, accepting Stahlecker's demands might ease the negotiation process and appease the existing regime there. On the other, a show of force and denial of Stahlecker's requests would appease the conservatives in the Party, and demonstrate Speer's courage and power as Führer. Speer pondered the options, and made his decision, hanging up the phone."
 speerostland.6.a:0 "Accept the demands. The less blood, the better."
 speerostland.6.b:0 "Push Stahlecker further. We're the Reich, not him."

 speerostland.7.t:0 "Investigating Insurgents"
 speerostland.7.d:0 ""Herr Stahlecker, the Führer is unable to fully grant one of your requests." The Reichskommissar eyed Schmidt sternly. "In good news, the majority of your said conditions can be guaranteed."\n\n"What is the catch, Herr Schmidt."\n\n"Your lower cabinet members will need to be investigated for security purposes. They may pose a considerable threat to the government in Germania, due to their links with the traitorous Bormann. I'm sure you understand that, in these trying times, the safety, wellbeing and stability of the Reich's people are of utmost importance to the Führer, and we can't be taking any major risks." Schmidt forced a smile. "For the good of the country, Herr Stahlecker."\n\nThe Ostlander stared at the table, grimacing. Schmidt observed him, wondering what thoughts lay behind those half glazed eyes."
 speerostland.7.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.8.t:0 "A Begrudging Acceptance"
 speerostland.8.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "I mean no disrespect, Herr Schmidt, but the past is the past. These are good men. Any grievances they may have had with your people can surely be overcome peacefully."\n\n"Herr Stahlecker, I appreciate your concern for your fellow Germans. Really, it is an honourable trait to have. As I said, however, the times cannot call for the sort of leniency that may have otherwise been desirable. In an ideal world, I would agree with you. Let bygones be bygones. The Führer, however, does not orchestrate an Elysium. We are building it, and we cannot allow workers who might pour sugar into our concrete. The new Germany needs stability."\n\nAnother long silence, before Stahlecker finally spoke."Okay. I will comply."\n\nSchmidt smiles warmly. "Thank you, Reichskommissar. One moment, please. I have to take this call.""
 speerostland.8.a:0 "Our negotiations push for more concessions, the man seems agreeable."
 speerostland.8.b:0 "Our negotiations accept Stahlecker's concessions, he has sacrificed much."

 speerostland.9.t:0 "No Reich for Old Men"
 speerostland.9.d:0 "The Reichskommissar stared at the table for almost a millenia, before raising his eyes back to Schmidt. The foreign minister swallowed. "Do you remember what we saw out there, Herr Schmidt? During the war? You weren't there for long, were you?"\n\n"Herr Stahlecker-"\n\n"I won't be coddled or convinced with a 'Herr', Schmidt." Stahlecker leant forward and stood slightly, pressing his palms into the table as he stared directly into the foreign minister's eyes.\n\n"We saw a countryside littered with Jewry and Bolshevism. We saw a land once roamed by our German and Baltic forefathers corrupted with the burning greed and degeneracy of the Slavic swine. It was disgusting, Schmidt. It was horrifying. When we cleansed it, we liberated the land from it's filth. Yet we did not go far enough."\n\nStahlecker stood up from the table. "Ostland has been through a civil war, and my men won it. We fought the forces of Jewry and Bolshevism with a loyalty to the party, and to the ideas of Hitler and National Socialism. Bormann, Bormann represented those loyalties. You, and that fraudulent Führer of yours, would return Ostland to these devils. My men, they have committed crimes by the standard of your petty courts. They loved Bormann. Under your false laws, they are guilty, but under God, they are innocent."\n\nThe Reichskommissar, before Schmidt could respond, had walked out the door. In the heavens, the drums of war began to beat."
 speerostland.9.a:0 "Scheiße."

 speerostland.10.t:0 "A Second Demand"
 speerostland.10.d:0 "Schmidt put down the phone. His eyes had already communicated enough information to Stahlecker for a single glance to turn the Reichskommissar into a daze of despair. "Herr Stahlecker, the Führer has requested that the investigations might widen their scope."\n\nStahlecker sighed audibly. "I understand your reservations about this, but you must understand that the Reich cannot afford any chances at any level of government, especially the higher levels. Think of what one disloyal minister could do. Fraudulent documents, leaked information; sabotage at these levels could ruin the Reich."\n\nIn the Reichskommissar's head, thoughts were buzzing. His men were being threatened. This regime, this new Germany, this new Führer, they didn't care about him or his people. But did he have a choice? If he didn't comply, then what? The Heer would simply storm the border, and his government would be wiped off the face of the planet. Besides, Schmidt hadn't mentioned anything about him being put on trial himself..."
 speerostland.10.a:0 "What is a warlord to do?"

 speerostland.11.t:0 "A Second Concession"
 speerostland.11.d:0 "Stahlecker looks at Schmidt, any semblance of light fading from his eyes as he did so. "I concede, Herr foreign minister. For the good of the country."\n\nSchmidt nodded with an expression of solemn sympathy for the terrified Reichskommissar. "Thank you, Herr Stahlecker. I understand how difficult this must be for you, but it is in all Germany's best interest. Excuse me for one moment, I need to take this call...""
 speerostland.11.a:0 "Give the man a break. A peaceful transition is now more than possible."
 speerostland.11.b:0 "Another push. The man himself must be trialled; who knows what hidden sympathies lie behind that quiet exterior..."

 speerostland.12.t:0 "A Bridge Too Far"
 speerostland.12.d:0 "Stahlecker glared at Schmidt. A palpable rage stretched across the man's face as he did so, breaking the facade of courtesy he had built up over the course of the negotiation. "You would have every German in Ostland hung for treason, Herr Schmidt. Your 'reformists' in Germania are no better than the savages of Burgundy."\n\nThe Reichskommissar stood, Schmidt staring in a frozen awe. "When Bormann fell, so did the last hope for the Reich. Your petty Führer doesn't deserve to even be called a German."\n\nWith a mild flourish of his coat, Stahlecker turned and left the room. Above the room and across Yggdrasil, the drums of war in Asgard began to beat. In the quiet of the negotiations chamber, Schmidt could hear them, just barely. A sign from the gods of more to come."
 speerostland.12.a:0 "Scheiße."

 speerostland.13.t:0 "A Final Demand"
 speerostland.13.d:0 "The phone hit the shelf, and Schmidt returned to the table. "A final issue to iron out, Herr Stahlecker." By the tone in his voice, almost forcefully gentle, Stahlecker understood what Schmidt was about to say. "The Führer requests that you undergo a trial, a fair one, just to ensure Germania understands your past. I personally trust that you would remain quiet loyal to the Reich, Herr Reichskommissar, but to secure the doubts in my government, I would recommend this path."\n\nStahlecker's depressed expression morphed into something of an abject terror. "I would keep in mind, Herr Stahlecker, that refusal to comply with these demands may end with more trouble for you and your government than compliance.""
 speerostland.13.a:0 "Let us hope he sees reason."
 
 speerostland.14.t:0 "A Final Concession"
 speerostland.14.d:0 "Stahlecker began a shaky nod. "I-I understand Herr Schmidt." The foreign minister extended his hand for a comforting handshake. "Thank you, Herr Stahlecker. You have served your country well."\n\nSchmidt understood the criminality of the man opposite him, but couldn't help but question himself. Was he the good guy anymore? Threatening these men with a purge or trial? Demanding concessions for a Reich he didn't believe in. For the good of the country, he told himself."
 speerostland.14.a:0 "For the good of the country."

 speerostland.15.t:0 "Mortal Danger"
 speerostland.15.d:0 "Stahlecker stood abruptly, stumbling away from the table. "N-no, Herr Schmidt. I-I can't do that."\n\nThe foreign minister stood, reaching out to try and comfort the man. "Herr Stahlecker, please, we can negotiate this."\n\n"No Schmidt. Y-you're all crazy. You'll kill me! You-you'll kill all of us!"\n\nThe Reichskommissar ran out of the room. Schmidt slumped back into his chair. He knew what this meant."
 speerostland.15.a:0 "War is coming."

 speerostland.16.t:0 "The Stahlecker Situation"
 speerostland.16.d:0 ""Franz Walter Stahlecker. Bormannite, and presently, Reichskommissar of Ostland," began the Führer. "In any situation, a major obstacle in our diplomatic reconstruction of the Reich's power."\n\n"Agreed, my Führer," replied Helmut Schmidt.\n\n"We need to rid ourselves of this blight quickly. I invited you here to discuss our options. You'll be leading a diplomatic envoy to the East to deal with the situation there. Any ideas?"\n\nSchmidt shuffled in his seat. "Well, my Führer..." His voice trailed off.\n\n"I'm listening, Schmidt."\n\n"I think it would be best to negotiate with Stahlecker. It might win us favour with the conservatives and give a show of force by punishing the traitor. We could force him into a harsh agreement and reintegrate Ostland back into the Reich that way. An enemy gone, territory gained and our friends in the Party might look at us with kinder eyes."\n\nSpeer stared into middle distance, thinking, but slowly nodding in approval. Schmidt couldn't help a slight, genuine smile at the peaceful route being favoured. "Or," Speer began, "we might declare war immediately. Rally the support of the reformists in a direct action and put him down quickly and effectively."\n\nSchmidt's expression morphed into something more familiarly depressed as he slouched in his chair. He let out a short and inaudible sigh. "It's your choice, my Führer."\n\n"Indeed. It is.""
 speerostland.16.a:0 "Diplomacy! Send Schmidt and the envoy."
 speerostland.16.b:0 "War! Rally the Heer and man the border."

 speerostland.17.t:0 "An Ally In The East?"
 speerostland.17.d:0 ""Meyer-Landrut won? Interesting." Speer rubbed his jaw in contemplation.\n\n"Indeed. While of course I'd hoped for this outcome I hadn't expected it. He's maintained that you were the best choice as Führer since his uprising began. No doubt he'll be eager to rejoin the Reich."\n\n"No doubt."\n\nSchmidt had expected more - wasn't Speer pleased? "With your permission I will send him an invitation to Germania. I'll handle the negotiations for Ostland's handover personally."\n\n"Yes... and no. I want to meet him myself, get the measure of the man." Another surprise."
 speerostland.17.a:0 "As you wish."

 speerostland.18.t:0 "Drechsler In Ostland"
 speerostland.18.d:0 ""Otto-Heinrich Drechsler. Militarist, expansionist, traitor, and victor." Speer read the report slowly, carefully taking in every detail. He knew Drechsler from his experience before the Burgerkrieg. The man was a paranoid coward, constantly itching for a fight, being a general pain. It was a surprise he'd never been disposed of.\n\nAnd yet, even as he caused problems in the east. Speer realized something. Drechsler was the perfect heel. Not only was he a traitor, but he was a militarist. Somehow, in losing- apparently, there had been a reformist in the Ostland chaos at some point- Speer had won more than he ever could have expected. A perfect target, a perfect ball and chain to tie to the reactionaries. Even if it would benefit the Gang as much as it benefited him, Speer was more than willing to make that sacrifice. Soon, Ostland would be under German control again, and the face of the traitors- along with their military ranks- would be plastered across every newspaper in Germany."
 speerostland.18.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.19.t:0 "Vituska In Ostland"
 speerostland.19.d:0 ""So, who is this Michal Vituska?" Speer read the report with interest, looking between it and Schmidt slowly, his eyes glancing over the little information that the paper provided.\n\n"We aren't entirely sure, Albert." Schmidt said with a sigh. "His past is. . .well, murky would be an understatement. What we know about him is that he's been a loyal collaborator with a lot of luck- at least, up until the Burgerkrieg, where he broke away from the Reichskommissariat to form a Central European Council, as he calls it. He's the dominant power in Ostland today."\n\n"And you said he was willing to negotiate?" Albert's eyes pored over the papers. Vituska's history was interesting, to say the least. A number of strange events and coincidences had brought him to the position of power he had held before Ostland broke down- definitely something that raised his eyebrow. Perhaps the man was more clever than he seemed.\n\n"Yes, he's said he's willing to cooperate. Shall I send an invitation?" Schmidt said. Speer nodded, and the Foreign Secretary made his exit. The Fuhrer put down his paper- there were certainly worse possible outcomes."
 speerostland.19.a:0 "We'll see what he wants."

 speerostland.20.t:0 "Meeting The Man"
 speerostland.20.d:0 "Michel Vituska entered Speer's office with a hearty "Heil!" and a quick salute, taking his seat with haste. Speer cocked his head- whether the man was nervous or enthusiastic, he couldn't tell. He took a breath before beginning. "Herr Vituska, thank you for accepting these negotiations. I trust you know why we're here?"\n\n"Yes, of course." Vituska quickly said, fidgeting in his chair a little. Speer's eyebrow raised a little- for a skilled leader, Vituska definitely seemed a little worried. Maybe it was the stakes. He disregarded it.\n\n"Now, I understand you had a few requests in exchange for rejoining the Reich, yes?" Speer said calmly. Vituska fidgeted a little more in his seat before he began.\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer. I would request to retain my role as Reichskommisar of Ostland, in exchange for my continued collaboration. In addition to this, I would similarly ask for the restrictions that Germany currently holds over Ostland to be relaxed, if not removed. With these two caveats, I'd be more than happy to peacefully rejoin the Reich."\n\nSpeer's eyebrows furrowed, his face betraying confusion, anger, and bemusement all at the same time. "You've come all this way to ask me to give you almost unimpeded control over one of the Reich's most valuable territories?"\n\n"Well, I wouldn't put it like that." Vituska said. Speer scoffed. What a waste of time."
 speerostland.20.a:0 "Onto Plan B."

 speerostland.21.t:0 "Harder Than We Thought"
 speerostland.21.d:0 ""Herr Vituska, you must be joking. Even if I wanted to- and I don't- can you imagine the damage of giving a Slav control of a Reichskommissariat? I'd be laughed out of the Reichstag. It can't be done." Speer's tone had taken on an almost incredulous tilt. He half expected Vituska to laugh and explain that it was all a joke. He didn't.\n\n"Herr Speer, these are my conditions. If you do not accept them, these talks must adjourn. "Vituska said. His earlier nervousness was gone, replaced with a steely look. As foolish as Speer considered the man, he had to admit that he had a lot of nerve. It would not save him.\n\n"Well, Herr Vituska, if these talks are adjourned, I have no choice but to mark you a traitor, which means. . ." Three guards entered the room, their weapons at the ready. Speer watched Vituska closely for his reaction. His eyebrows furrowed in confusion when the man smiled.\n\n"You didn't think he'd actually come to this meeting in person, did you?"\n\nSpeer froze for a moment, before reaching for the photograph of Vituska he had on his desk and holding it up to the man's face. At a glance, they seemed to match, but further inspection proved it- this was not the same person. He threw the photo down and sighed.\n\n"Son of a bitch.""
 speerostland.21.a:0 "Clever man."

 speerostland.22.t:0 "Kovner In Ostland"
 speerostland.22.d:0 "During the Bürgerkrieg, chaos consumed much of Europe. Perhaps the most chaotic of these battlegrounds was not found in Frankfurt, or Saxony, but rather in Ostland. Ostland, once designed as "The Model Colony", proved that moniker to be a falsehood, as it fell to pieces within days of the Reich's own failure. Six sides burst from the unsteady Reichskommissariat, each fighting over the future of the area.\n\nStunningly, the United Partisan Organization, led by noted terrorist and murderer Abba Kovner, has come out on top of Ostland. This is an unmitigated disaster for us- not only because of Kovner's well-known Anti-German sentiment, but because of the political implications this holds. Already, conservatives in the Reichstag have made hay with this issue, attempting to tie our reformist views to this outcome. While this is unquestionably false, it's caught on in some circles, and our influence is bound to take a hit. Best to make short work of this and move on as fast as we can."
 speerostland.22.a:0 "What a mess."

 speerostland.23.t:0 "The Ostland Intervention"
 speerostland.23.d:0 "Speer's face paled as he read through the report. He was alone- there was no need for Schmidt, nor for anyone else in the Gang. No, this was an open-and-shut decision. An invasion was the only option for such a madman as Abba Kovner.\n\nThe reports chilled his blood to even look at. Stories of German soldiers being executed, German civilians being shot regularly, soldiers hanging from trees and lampposts- it was enough to make anyone retch. Such depraved brutality could not and would not be tolerated by the Reich.\n\nIt was, perhaps, the fastest the Reich's bureaucracy had moved since the Second World War. Within hours, divisions pushed across the Ostland border, engaging partisan forces wherever they found them. Each of them had two goals, and two goals only- push through Ostland as fast as possible, and save as many settlers as they could."
 speerostland.23.a:0 "There's no time to waste."

 speerostland.24.t:0 "Jeckeln In Ostland"
 speerostland.24.d:0 "Few names provoke such strong reactions in Germany as the name Schutzstaffel. Most react with hate, some with fear, some others with disgust. No matter who you ask, however, you're almost guaranteed to hear a tale of their brutality. One of the most widely reviled organizations in German history, the hope was that, with their defeat in the Burgerkrieg, they would be permanently banished to Burgundy to rot.\n\nUnfortunately, this is not the case.\n\nElements of the Ostland SS, led by Friedrich Jeckeln, have managed to seize control over Ostland, and are ruling with a fist of iron. Their maniacal ideology must be put down with extreme prejudice, effective immediately. On the political front, this development has aided the reformist wing of the party immeasurably, seeing as they've made numerous successful comparisons between the conservative wing of the Party and the SS. In any case, the intervention must happen, and it must happen soon, or there may be no Ostland to return to."
 speerostland.24.a:0 "How does this keep happening?"

 speerostland.25.t:0 "Chaos In Ostland"
 speerostland.25.d:0 "Schmidt's shoes clacked against the wood floor as he made his way to Speer's office. As he stepped inside, he could tell Speer was expecting him- he had been watching the door already. With a quick salute, he began.\n\n"My Fuhrer, as you know, Ostland is still engulfed in conflict. Their factions are still locked in combat with each other- six of them at start. That number has since been reduced."\n\nSpeer nodded. "Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\nSchmidt sighed. "There was, my Fuhrer, but his faction has been crushed. Andreas Meyer-Landrut, the industrialist. He gave it his best shot, but. . . well, he didn't succeed."\n\nSpeer grunted. "And there's nobody else there we could work with?"\n\n"No."\n\n"Well." Speer looked out his window. "That's a pain, isn't it? Get the troops ready. We'll intervene, restore order, and go from there."\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer." And in a moment, Schmidt was gone."
 speerostland.25.a:0 "Frustrating."

 speerostland.26.t:0 "Chaos in Ostland"
 speerostland.26.d:0 "Schmidt's shoes clacked against the wood floor as he made his way to Speer's office.

Their factions are still locked in combat with each other- six of them at start. That number has since been reduced."\n\nSpeer nodded. "Is there anyone within that mess we can work with?"\n\n"Yes, my Fuhrer." Speer perked up at that, his eyes widening. "Andreas Meyer-Landrut, a major industrialist in the region, has led a faction of reformists through the struggle. He's held his own quite well. Currently, he is the only faction I believe we could truly negotiate with."\n\nSpeer smiled. "Perfect. Organize an intervention. We'll move in, secure the region, and then take over for the man. It'll run like clockwork."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer." Schmidt said, with a smile on his face. It seemed both men were quite pleased with this result."
 speerostland.26.a:0 "Perfect."

 speerostland.27.t:0 "Thank You For Your Service"
 speerostland.27.d:0 "Landrut smiled as he walked towards Speer, the men fast approaching each other in the hallway. Speer, for his part, looked suitably jovial as the men shared a warm handshake. "My Fuhrer, what an honor to meet you!" Landrut said amicably, his smile not leaving his face. Speer returned it.\n\n"Yes, Herr Landrut, you've truly done the Reich a service. Without you, this whole operation would be much more of a pain than it currently is. I can't thank you enough."\n\n"Of course, my Fuhrer. It was no trouble, really. I trust that this new administration will continue our efforts?"\n\n"Well, Herr Landrut, I need you to sign this first. Make it official and all." The two men stopped by a table with a paper on hand. Landrut took a pen and, still smiling, signed it. Speer smiled.\n\n"We can't thank you enough for your cooperation, Herr Landrut. Rest assured that Ostland will reform just as much as anywhere else in the Reich.""

 ###Moscowien EVENTS###
 
 speer_moskowien.3.t:0 "God Help Me, I Was Only 19" #Start of German Soldier Event Chain
 speer_moskowien.3.d:0 "Matthäus Schornberger leaned his chair back on two legs and lit his cigarette. The smoke wafted lazily into the air before being suddenly sucked out of the room, dragged by the wind that blew through the opened window. He puffed thoughtlessly as he stared out the window, taking in his street on the west end of Fulda. His father would kill him if he found out he was smoking, which is why he had to do it up in his room on the third floor of their house, one level above the kitchen and two levels above his father's workshop, filled with the tools of a watchmaker. Of course, his father was much more than just a watchmaker- he was a hero, an Iron Cross recipient, first class. Though his father never flaunted it, he knew the neighbors knew it. You could see it in their enthusiastic greetings, their preference of his business over others, the favors and gifts they gave him. His father was a man that all, including Matthias, respected; a man who had stood up to the Judeo-Bolsheviks out east and obliterated them. He was a man to look up to.\n\nWhat did Matthäus have to look forward to in his life, anyhow? He had turned the question over and over in his mind for months now, and he still had no answer. Sure, he studied, as his father wished, but what was the point? The slaves did all the work that Germany needed already. Did he really want to waste what should be the greatest years of his life on a degree he would have no purpose for, just for a society that had no need for it?"
 speer_moskowien.3.a:0 "What's the use of it?"
 
 speer_moskowien.77.t:0 "Making Up His Mind"
 speer_moskowien.77.d:0 "The army, on the other hand, was where Matthäus saw his legacy being made. There, he could serve a purpose to his fatherland. He could come home and have the same respect his father had. He could be someone, do something, and come home a stronger, wiser man, just as his father had. Besides, he still remembered the war stories his father had told him back when he was a boy. They spoke of joy and camaraderie, of glorious victories over the Jews and Slavs, of a great triumph and the stories that accompanied it. That sounded much better to Matthäus than sitting around in an office twiddling his thumbs for the rest of his life.\n\nThe only thing that had been stopping him from rushing off to the recruitment office so far was, strangely enough, his father. Matthäus had floated the idea past him once and quickly learned not to make that mistake again. He'd never seen his father so angry. He'd made him promise he'd never go to the Heer, under any circumstances. Of course, Matthäus had promised- what else was he going to do?- but now he wondered why. He sat for a moment, the wind blowing through his room, deep in thought.\n\nSuddenly, he snuffed his cigarette out against the windowsill. He knew why his father was so angry about the mere thought of his son in the Heer- he didn't think he could do it. His father thinks he was too soft, did he? He thought he couldn't handle war, did he? He thought Matthäus couldn't handle responsibility or pressure, or having people depending on him. Matthäus knew it to be true- his father didn't seem to have much of a problem with telling his war stories, did he? Was he scared that his son could possibly upstage him, do more than even he could? Well, he was going to see it now. Matthäus was going to go into the army, and he was going to make his father wonder why he'd ever doubted him. He was going to make him sorry he'd ever even tried to stop him. He was going to be a soldier, and nothing was going to get in his way.\n\nFuriously, Matthäus scribbled out a farewell note and slapped it down on the kitchen table on his way to the door. While grabbing his coat, he turned around to savor the view of the house one more time. He was going to come back, and he was going to be more than his father could ever have dreamed of being.\n\nHe was going to be a hero."
 speer_moskowien.77.a:0 "Like Father, like son."


 speer_moskowien.4.t:0 "Crisp Uniform"
 speer_moskowien.4.d:0 "The wind swept Matthäus's hair to the side as he stood in front of the recruiting office. The cold, concrete building almost seemed to stare right back at him, looking straight through him. In front of the building stood two Heer members, dressed in full parade attire. SIlently, he made his way past them and into the building.\n\n"Heil Speer!" The recruiting officer, sitting neatly at his desk, snapped to his salute, an action Matthäus returned. "What can I do for you, sir?"\n\n"I'm looking to join the Heer, sir." Matthäus replied, confidently. He made sure to keep his chest out and chin up.\n\n"Good, good. Just sign these papers and go into that room back there. You'll find a uniform, a helmet, and we'll direct you onto a bus out of here shortly."\n\nMatthäus sat down in front of the table, the pen clicking in his hands. Multiple papers were set in front of him, each detailing oaths and promises. "I will be loyal to the Fuhrer and to Germany." "I will not falter in my duty to the Reich." "I will uphold and support my fellow soldier, and follow orders without question." Yes, yes, and yes. He soon began to stop reading the papers, simply signing where they asked him to. Finally, he moved on to the back room, where his uniform awaited him.\n\nCrisp, folded, and clean, the grey uniform sat among rows of other uniforms identical to it. A small part of Matthäus's mind told him that this would be the cleanest he'd ever see it. He grabbed one that fit him, trying on the tunic and pants. The helmet, clean and polished, didn't fit all that well, but Matthäus couldn't find one that fit better, so he took it. When he was ready, he marched proudly out of the room and into the back, taking a seat besides other, similarly uniformed recruits.\n\nWithin minutes, a bus pulled up to the office, and the men were loaded on. As the bus pulled away, Matthäus took one last look around the city he had called home all his life. A new chapter of his story was just beginning."
 speer_moskowien.4.a:0 "Just sign on the dotted line."
 
 speer_moskowien.5.t:0 "Harsh Reality"
 speer_moskowien.5.d:0 "Get over the wall, maggot!"\n\nMatthäus's legs swung and scratched helplessly at the bricks, his hands barely grasping onto the edge of the wall he dangles from. Below him, a small queue was beginning to pile up, men watching his every swing as he desperately struggled for any traction. Though he couldn't see him, he could already tell the drill sergeant was getting closer to him.\n\n"There's Russian machine guns behind you, boy! They're getting closer, they're gonna kill your squadmates if you don't get past that fucking wall, boy!" Soft chuckles from the men below him. What made the situation even more humiliating was that none of the men before him had many problems with getting up and over. It was Matthäus, and Matthäus alone, who was struggling so much with it. He tried to pull himself up and over again, to no avail.\n\n"They're on top of us now, boy! They're shredding us, boy, there's guts all over your legs, boy, get over that wall!" Matthäus was about ready to just let go and quit. He wasn't made out for this, clearly. His father had been right.\n\nThe thought stopped him in his tracks. His father, if he returned home, would be insufferable. He would be right that Matthäus wasn't strong enough for this. Matthäus could picture his dad cracking open a beer in his shop, saying to some curious customer, "I told him over and over to not go, but he did, and you know what happened? I was right, and he's back at home now. I tell you, they aren't made like they used to be, are they?"\n\nWith a final heave, Matthäus pushed over the wall and fell to the ground on the other side. The drill sergeant gave him shit, for sure, but he didn't hear it. He was still going. He was still a soldier."

 speer_moskowien.7.d:0 "The truck shook and rattled as it rolled along the autobahn, staying behind the truck in front of it. Matthäus knew where they were going, and it shook him a little bit. The convoy was headed to Danzig- the furthest Matthäus had ever been from Fulda was Germania, and that had only been once or twice. Fulda, and the area around it, had been all he had known. Shaking a little, he pulled his assignment orders out of his pocket, reading them over for what seemed to be the hundredth time. Everything was in order- He was on a truck to Danzig to join the 16th Infantry Division. He assumed the men around him were on the same journey. The 16th Infantry- not a division that Matthäus had heard of in passing, but name recognition didn't matter much.\n\nThe man next to him tapped him on the shoulder. "Hey." he said cautiously. "You're from Bachrain?"\n\n"Oh, yeah, I've lived there my whole life."\n\n"Me too." The man said. "Schornberger. . .I feel like I've heard the name. The watchmaker, right?"\n\n"Not me. That's my dad."\n\n"Oh, really? He's good at what he does. A soldier too, I've heard. You following in his footsteps?"\n\n"Not exactly." Matthäus laughed. The two men's conversation continued, and soon other men began to join in. Matthäus learned they were all going to the 16th as well, as he expected. Most were from around Fulda, if not the city itself, though there were some from other areas. One even said he was from Vienna. Soon, the squad became fast friends. It's hard not to like someone when you spend 3 hours of a boring truck ride talking to them. As Matthäus spoke, he knew that he'd truly found his calling. If only his father could see him now!"

 speer_moskowien.6.t:0 "New Orders"
 speer_moskowien.6.d:0 "It was a normal day in Danzig, as the last six months had been. Matthäus lay in his bunk, daydreaming of going home. This wasn't the hero's life he had been promised. Indeed, the most action he had seen was an out of control truck crashing into the wall of the base a few months back. The rest of his time had been spent idly patrolling various parts of Danzig, from the docks to the barracks to the Governor's Palace. In general, it seemed like Matthäus would never become the same hero his father had been- not for lack of trying, but simply out of lack of opportunity.\n\nHis friend, a fellow named Johan, opened the door to the barrack and walked inside. "Guys, pack your shit. We're leaving in two hours, going out east." He yelled, to the complaint of those who were catching up to the sleep they had lost in the last few days. The barracks sleepily came alive, as man after man rolled out of their beds to put on their uniform. Matthäus did not move, instead thinking for a moment, before catching Johan's attention.\n\n"Johan, where are we going? What are we doing out east?"\n\n"We're being deployed. Apparently we're restoring order to the east, or some shit. I'm not clear on the details myself, but I know we're being deployed."\n\nMatthäus rushed from his bed, eager to get his pack ready. Finally, some action! He had been hoping for this day ever since he had joined the Heer. All the training, all the waiting, all the busywork- all had been leading up to these moments, where Matthäus could finally prove that, yes, he was able to do all the same work and more that his father did so many years ago. Within a few minutes, his personal items rested snugly in his pack. Matthäus, now dressed in his field greys, took one look at himself in the mirror on the wall before he marched outside to the trucks.\n\nHe looked quite nice. He looked natural. Above all else, he looked ready."

 speer_moskowien.8.d:0 "Matthäus's G1 rocked violently in his hands as he emptied the magazine down the street. All around him, his squadmates did their best to keep the fire going, ducking occasionally to avoid return fire. Matthäus ducked down again to reload, not even noticing the bullets that cracked the wall behind him. For now, his mind was solely focused on not dying, and serving his homeland. Even with his focus, and his attempts to keep composure, he could feel the manic feeling of terror slowly rising within him, as it had for almost an hour now. How long had they been fighting in this street for? How much ammo could they possibly have left, and what would happen if they ran out?\n\nFor now, however, those thoughts were quickly pushed away by a sharp tap from his NCO.\n\n"Schornberger! I need you to do some shit for us!" the man shouted, but whatever he shouted was drowned out by the next man over's yelling.\n\n"Holy shit! Johan just ate a fucking grenade up there!"\n\nMatthäus looked over the trench to the next foxhole, where his friend was noticeably absent. As he looked, however, he noticed movement in a ruined house, off to the left. None of his squadmates were in there- could a flanking attack be coming? A quick slap from the NCO brought him back to attention.\n\n"Like I was saying, Private, I need you to find a command element, tell them to give us reinforcements, supplies, something! We're running low! You hear me, private?""

 speer_moskowien.9.d:0 "Matthäus, without really even thinking about it, hopped over the wall and began his dash down the street. He didn't hear his NCO's shouting, whether it was positive or negative. All he heard was the thump of his own heart and the crackling of a machine gun, and suddenly the ground around him exploded in shards of stone and shrapnel as bullets crackled off the road around him. He didn't care, as long as they didn't hit him. By some divine miracle, or insane luck, they didn't. Matthäus managed to slide into the foxhole unscathed, slamming into the other wall from the sheer momentum he had carried. Quickly brushing himself off, he turned to find his friend.\n\nJohan was lying in a puddle of his own blood- a puddle that was now lapping around Matthäus's boots- with the look on his face of a rapidly dying man. His uniform, sliced to rags by the shrapnel, was now damp with blood from a thousand wounds. His arm, still holding his rifle, now lay severed behind him. As Matthäus watched in horror, Johan took one last look at him,eyes wide open, before finally falling silent.\n\nMatthäus was too terrified now to even throw up. His feeling of panic, which had been so well surpressed, now exploded just as ferociously as the grenade. In a blind moment of sheer terror, Matthäus scrabbled for the edge of the foxhole, looking for any means of escape, to run away, back past his line, out of Smolensk, all the way back to his house in Fulda.\n\nThe machine gun bullets cracked against the foxhole again, and Matthäus caught a stinging reminder of why the foxhole was there when one bullet grazed his fingers, sending him tumbling back into the blood puddle. Without covering fire, there was no way he could escape alive. Matthäus sank down against a wall, his eyes drawn to the corpse of what was once his friend. He couldn't look away. All he could do was sit and stare.\n\nThis wasn't at all like his father's stories."

 speer_moskowien.10.d:0 "With a jump, Matthäus was off, racing through the streets of Smolensk. Bullets cracked against the walls behind him, sending him stumbling into the next street. From there, he turned, running with his head down as he raced past corpses upon corpses. The screaming of the dying and the wounded rattled through his head as he ran, still looking for any sort of command element.\n\nFive blocks down, he stumbled into a makeshift hospital, hastily thrown together in the chaos of the fighting. He pushed through doctors tending to their patients, nurses carrying bodies off of beds and into a pile further away, and the occasionally walking wounded waiting for a table to open up. Finally, he broke free of the chaos, continuing his search.\n\nThe horrors of the battle he had fought through became more and more clear as he seemingly revisited them all on his path. On the way forward, it had been easy to ignore them, what with the battle and bullets flying everywhere. Now, on the way back, there was no haze to cover up the bodies, the blood, and the wreckage.\n\nEventually, Matthäus did find the command center. He barely even noticed himself monotonely requesting extra supplies for his position. When the commander heeded his request, sending men to relieve his unit, Matthäus hardly noticed. He instead sat down in a corner and tried to comprehend what he had seen."

 speer_moskowien.11.d:0 "Matthäus gingerly entered the building, rifle ready in his hands. He noticed a slight shake to his aim- perhaps from adrenaline, perhaps from fear. The sounds of the battle roaring outside were now only muffled cracks and bangs reverberating through the walls. The house itself was dark- the electricity had been cut long ago- and the only light that filtered in came through cracks in the ceiling and walls. Matthäus's eyes strained to see clearly in the darkness as he slowly moved forwards.\n\nA whimper in the next room caught his attention, and Matthäus stopped dead in his tracks. He could hear faint breathing, labored and wheezing as it was. A small shuffle confirmed that the source of the noise was off to the right. Slowly, Matthäus steeled himself and popped around the corner.\n\nA beam of light illuminated a young Russian, no older than Matthäus himself, slick with blood. A picture lay in his right hand, a old rifle in his left. The two regarded each other for moment, neither moving a muscle, as if they shared a connection among the chaos of war.\n\nMatthäus raised his rifle and pumped six rounds into the boy, silencing his breaths. The picture fell from his hand, and Matthäus was barely able to make out the boy standing with his mother and father.\n\nMatthäus exited the house blankly, returning to the line. The Sergeant asked him if the building was clear, which Matthäus could only reply with a nod. Without another word, Matthäus returned to the line, firing the occasional shot down at the enemy."

The street, the battle,the things he had seen- all kept replaying in his head, like a long, terrible movie. He couldn't stop thinking about the crack of rifle fire, the screams of the wounded and dying, or the yelling of men who knew that, at any moment, they could be dead. After an hour of this torture, Matthäus resolved for another sleepless night. He quietly hopped out of his bunk, trudging to the bathroom. Perhaps he could fix himself there.\n\nOnce he got into the dim light of the bathroom, he took a long look at himself. A tired, unshaven face stared right back into his eyes. One simultaneously young in body but old in mind. Perhaps, with a few touch-ups and a good shave, he could look like the boy he once was, but one look into his own dull eyes was a surefire tell that he wasn't truly the boy from Fulda anymore.\n\nHe took a sip of water out of the sink, washing his face afterwards, before heading back to his bed. There, he lay down quietly, waiting for the sun to come up and a new day to start."

And he ran!"\n\nThe table erupted with laughter as the man finished his story, and Matthäus cracked a smile of his own. These were good people he had met- being new to Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität was quite the overwhelming experience. Matthäus had managed, but it seemed he had finally met some people he could fit in with.\n\n"So that's how high school ended for me. Matthäus, you're the new one here. What did you do before University?"\n\n"I, ah. . ." Mathaus paused for a moment. How would they react? Should he be honest? Christ, they're all looking at him now. No time to think.\n\n"I served with the Heer out east, in Smolensk."\n\nAnother moment of silence around the table- perhaps a silence for Matthäus's chances of making friends here. "Well, uh, that's interesting." said one.\n\n"Did you kill anyone?" said another, entirely too excited for the question he had asked."\n\n"What war?" said a third. Matthäus did not answer any of these questions. Instead, he picked up his bag and quickly walked out of the cafeteria. They didn't understand. Nobody here did, and nobody here ever would. He was alone, and perhaps he always would be."

The Fuhrer listened to what those around him now were discussing. Their ideas mixed together. That formed a great concoction of intellect that made little sense as emotions were injected into it followed by urgency.\n\nBut Speer knew that he had to keep his head above the murky waters of the war room. Here, in Germania, he had to make great efforts to prevail against both the military and the Slavs to the East.\n\nHere, Speer reminded himself, he had to keep eyes and ears everywhere. And right now, he had to take a breath and dive under the surface.\n\nThere he was with the sharks. And they were Speidel, Schörner, and Tresckow.\n\nSpeer estimated that Speidel would want something slow, something careful. Tresckow wanted a balanced approach. And Schörner, for the animal that he was, with war always his aim, wanted something hard...something fast, and that, Speer told himself, was dangerously similar to the old way of war.\n\nNow their squabbling was coming to an end as they turned to Speer, who had looked up at them.

It would allow us to behave better. We would take on the appearance of peacekeepers. We would not show too much force but instead we would show our intentions to give support to our own people in the East."\n\nSchörner shook his head at his words and told him to his face, "You are asking too much of our boys. You don't know what it's going to be like for them to face the Slavs. Those people would shoot our boys even if they behaved nicely and spoke to them politely. Neither they nor we are friendly neighbors now, are we?"\n\nBut Tresckow shot at him with words. "You're right, but this can save civilian lives." Schörner groaned at that and scoffed. Tresckow ignored him, adding to Speidel's points, "It can keep us from playing too much of a part in bringing the blood of innocent people on our troops. And it would show to the world that we are being intelligent about it."\n\n"What's intelligent is getting our men into the fire and out of there quickly rather than asking them to stay in the fire and do nothing," Schörner said, his face clearly showing that he wasn't having it from either of them.\n\n"It isn't going to be like that," Speidel told him, "because this will show the natives that we are not here to kill them all. They might even cooperate with us."\n\n"Hah! Good luck with that. No Slav would embrace us."\n\n"They won't, but it's worth trying. I'd rather keep civilian casualties low and our troops safe with careful officers rather than go headlong into a war that will spill the blood of everyone involved, either civilian or not," Tresckow added.\n\n"And this is only a plan.

The fear of being shot at by patient snipers or angry villagers settled on their shoulders the more they marched and halted and marched out again. But when no shot rang out, when no man shouted for cover or a medic, it seemed to them that the plan was working.\n\nStill, the Germans were cautious. And when they encountered civilians, reluctant men would remove themselves from the company of their comrades and their vehicles, carrying some rations or some kind of supplies to them. Most of the time, the meetings were brief, awkward, and all too nerve wracking on everyone. But at least those ended well. The rest of the encounters were either quite wholesome or quite bothersome.\n\nThe more they moved into the heart of the native territories, the more resistance and reluctance they found. Civilians either refused to welcome them, take their supplies, or reconsider shooting them. Snipers took advantage of kind German soldiers. And officers found themselves commanding squads of men yelling for permission to shoot back.\n\nAnd understandably, the officers were not enjoying this kind of control over what they had to do on the field.

They can't just refuse to obey orders like this! This places the entire plan in the mercy of the enemy."\n\nTresckow added, closing the folder containing his copies of what was sent to them from the East, "They should face justice.

Tresckow shook his head and sighed. "Look, I do not think that it is going to make things easier for our men and the other officers following our instructions if we do away with these men. But it could most likely be the only thing we can do."\n\n"It's not surprising. I would agree with them, honestly," Schörner quipped, drawing the irritated glances of the two other officers, "I really think it's better for us all to be lenient.

Their own Fatherland was doing this to them, all because they saw the ridiculousness of having to follow orders that kept them from doing their duties.\n\nNevertheless, no matter how much they wanted not to face the sentences put on them, several of them were taken out in Berlin to be hanged in public. And there would be no way to refuse a hanging.\n\nBy groups, they were noosed. By groups, they were given chances to speak their last words. By groups, they were told of their crimes again. And by groups, they were dropped, their faces concealed by black hoods, their bodies suspended by the necks. Much to the cheers of the student movement which opposed them as well as to the grief of their families and fellow officers.\n\nThey were not to be buried as heroes.

Many of the men who heard the order turned their heads. Right before their convoy, a burning carcass of a tank. The route was blocked. Then came sharp passing sounds from the left and right. Some men fell from their transports. Others dove behind large rocks or piles of dirt. A loud but brief explosion came from the back of the convoy. Then another.\n\n"Ambush! Ambush!

 speer_moskowien.24.d:0 "The Fuhrer and his Security Minister shoved themselves into the car, leaving one of the homes they've visited today. They waved farewell to the family that welcomed them, seeing their faces, some of them still with red eyes and tears going down their cheeks, handkerchiefs wiping them away, for the last time. For now.\n\nSpeer sighed as he looked away, Tresckow glanced at the Fuhrer, seeing him with a frown so deep that he almost felt like comforting the man. But he was the Fuhrer, and as an officer under him, he thought it disrespectful to try to do too much for him.\n\nThe Fuhrer himself felt his own heart come under another weight. He had visited so many families all over Germania. Later, he would have to see to the other families in the rest of the Reich. He wondered how many times he could say those words. "I'm so sorry for your loss..."\n"I regret telling you that your son has fallen in..."\n"My deepest condolences go to you and your family."\n"My sympathies are with you..."\n\nSpeer shook his head at himself, ignoring Tresckow's curious glance. The car had stopped. Tresckow reminded him as the Fuhrer stepped out, "This is the Kraus family. The soldier...he had-"\n\n"A pregnant wife and two daughters. I know." He turned to one of his escorts, who had left the car before he did, "Do we have the..." The escort nodded, looking up at the windows of the house. The Fuhrer followed as did Tresckow.\n\nFrom there, the silent eyes of the woman observed them. She seemed to tremble as she looked down at them.\n\nSpeer held his eyes up then sighed, reached for his hat, and took it off his head. Then he lowered his gaze and walked to the door and knocked gently. He waited for the woman to come down and open the door. When he saw her face, Speer thought he had seen the face of his own wife, in the same manner this woman showed her inevitable grief.\n\n"

The tape has been delivered to the war room just after the results from the authorized strike on Novgorod was accomplished. With Speidel and Schörner watching it with him as the planes finally came over the city and released their bombs, flying away in another direction after great balls of fire and heat burst out of the places in the city where the bombs landed.\n\nAnother flight of planes came over, taking turns in dropping bombs that split into smaller ones. The smaller ones scattered more easily over the city, obliterating those that were not on fire or else driving more of the flames into the rest of the area.\n\n"This is insane," Tresckow spoke, drawing Speer's eyes from the monitor. The Prussian was shaking his head, his eyes filled with dread and regret.\n\n"We have to do this," The Fuhrer said with resignation. His eyes returned to the monitor, ignoring Tresckow's following words.\n\n"As if we do not have any other choice! This isn't how we are supposed to respond to the enemy's forces! We're just killing civilians!"\n\n"What does it matter? Civilians are helping the enemy fight us off and kill our men. They deserve it, Tresckow," Schörner stated. Speidel said nothing, merely shaking his head.\n\n"It's still unnecessary! And it stains our honor as soldiers of Germany! This isn't the kind of war we should fight."\n\n"It is now," The Fuhrer said, "because this is the best way we can show force against the Slavs for what they've done."\n\nSchörner smiled. But Tresckow refused to let it go.\n\n"I will not stand for this. This is just not the right way of war. I will not have it, my Fuhrer. You must not let this happen! You should have not listened to him!"'\n\nThough he glared at Schörner, the Fuhrer said nothing. Speidel turned to him and told him, "What is done is done. We can't stop it now."\n\n"It could have been avoided. It could have been left undone." Tresckow then turned away, leaving the war room, slamming the doors behind him.\n\n"

He looked up to the others.\n\n"The enemy is still not giving up the fight." The Fuhrer's eyes were on the map. He crossed his arms and shook his head. "No matter how careful we are, this whole thing is coming to a halt."\n\n"If you only just listened to me and kept going, we would have won this whole thing," Schörner boasted.\n\nTresckow glared at him and said, "We could lose more men if we force them to go into the jaws of the Russian resistance. Do you want them to go in there like blind men?"\n\n"Well, our soldiers are not blind, are they?" Shorner shot back.\n\n"Enough," Speer told them, his eyes remaining on the map, studying the lines and the units arranged for them all to see. He sighed at himself and said, "Things are not going according to plan. This intervention is not going to be done within the time we wanted it to be done."\n\n"I'm afraid that is so, my Fuhrer."\n\n"

Focus on giving them the freedom to maneuver and to engage the enemy!"\n\nSpeer frowned. "Schörner, I know I am interested in a swift end to the bloodshed, but if we do that..."\n\n"If we do that, we save more lives - German lives! We should not care too much about the casualties of those causing trouble for our Fatherland in the East. Away with them, the pests!"\n\nTresckow turned to Speer as Speidel too scowled at the man. But Speer kept his attention only towards Schörner, hating him for what he suggested. He had a point, but what about our reputation? "What you suggest is as terrible as committing the same methods our men once used in the West Russian War and before! Are you not aware what you are risking with, Generalfeldmarschall?"\n\nThe determined army officer just shrugged at the Fuhrer and gestured towards the maps, especially to the units displayed. "I only suggest what works. It is better than delaying our men, delaying their support, and above all, delaying Germany's hand in saving our settlers. Is that not our purpose?"\n\nThe other two now turned to Speer, who still maintained a disgusted expression against Schörner. Not only was he suggesting a nightmare for Germany's morality, his disdain for the man in charge was coming clear. And the Fuhrer clenched his jaws and turned to the maps. Only he could decide what do with his forceful suggestion.\n\n"

No longer.\n\nIn the sight of the rising sun, the morning gave the Germans the advantage in surprise and in time. Tanks and men were converging on the unsuspecting people as they woke up and came out of their houses or returned from fishing at the lake. With ruthless rapidity, the cannons sounded, delivering shells that collapsed and burst buildings apart, pieces flying in all directions as machine guns and grenades did the job of murdering men, women, and children.\n\nIntelligence had suspected enemy forces here, and the Germans sought it out, but found nothing, but they could not stop, so they kept hammering the small town.\n\nAgain and again, the Germans landed blow after blow against it. And as they did, the people attempted to flee. They ran to the boats and when those were destroyed, they swam into the lake. Others ran out of the town, chased down by troops and vehicles, crushed by treads or by wheels, shot in the back if they were too slow or slipped into the ground.\n\nThe wounded who dared to crawl away or limp behind some rubble were bayoneted or finished off with pistols. Nobody the Germans found was spared.\n\nBut the Russian earth would not hide the secrets of the invaders. Even if they attempted to, the ground would spit them out, disgusted and horrified...\n\n"

You have given me the-"\n\n"I do not want you to use that as an excuse! You cannot tell me that you let our forces massacre an entire settlement of Russian civilians because of what I permitted you to do. I permitted you only to engage the enemy." The Fuhrer now clapped his right hand, open now, down on the table, startling those who passed by and saw this unfold. "But what you did is beyond engaging the enemy!"\n\nSchörner stared his superior down and stood his ground at the table. "Intelligence reported that-"\n\n"No," said Tresckow, intelligence was incorrect. They gave you another target. But you ignored that. What you've done is a grave error on your part, not theirs."\n\nSpeidel now spoke up, to support Speer and Tresckow, "You also ignored statements by your own reconnaissance that no enemy resistance was found in the town. Evidence was laid down in front of you again and again but you did not respond. You ignored what they said. You set aside all the warnings!"\n\n"Would you rather I let that town come under Russian control? You don't know what's on the ground!" Schörner now pointed at Speidel, rudely so. "Why don't you try to see what happens when we don't make sure of what is there in the town or not?"\n\n"So you admit you destroyed it?" Speer asked sharply, a revolted smile on his face. "Well? You've done it. You've killed men, women, and children that had nothing to do with our enemy!"\n\n"I did what I had to do. I don't care what you all say! This is necessary. It will end the war in shorter time than-"\n\n"Than what? That is foolishness, Schörner!" Tresckow shook his head at him and turned away.\n\nSpeidel crossed his arms and stepped closer to Schörner. The man reacted by pushing him away, provoking his counterpart to grapple him. But before things could escalate, the Fuhrer said, "Enough! This is the war room! Behave yourselves!"\n\nWhen everyone had calmed down, the Fuhrer sighed as he came to think about what to do. He looked up after thinking over it and announced his decision.\n\n"

It only regained contact as it moved closer to it, requesting air strikes from nearby jets sent out from the nearest available airbase, in order to destroy with extreme prejudice a large opposing force present in the town. Such strikes destroyed the majority of the town, with reports from the detachment detailing both the elimination of the enemy and of unfortunate civilians.\n\nThat was supposed to be the story. And that will have to be the story. It is important for us to control the flow of events and the validity of such events. As soldiers of the Reich, we cannot allow the truth to become a tool for our enemies to use against us. Therefore, to prevent anyone and everyone else from learning about the blunder of our troops against the town of Shimsk, we will have to be careful in establishing a cordon around information that comes out about it."

It was supposed to be avoidable, but like any mistake, like any error, it was no longer avoidable once it was done.\n\nThe world returned to their opinion of Germany. In the light, Germany still was a horrible European power that used force to put down threats to herself. And Speer, looking back at it, felt a long sigh shudder out of his lungs. The regrets weighed on him. Banished in pain, his heart burned as strongly as it burned when the war ended.\n\nFeeling lost, he closed his eyes, hoping to sleep and forget about such memories. He hoped in himself that he would not have to make the same mistakes that led to such an unfortunate end.

 speer_moskowien.35.d:0 "The poorly built train provided no comfort for the Oberleutenant, as while the train whipping back and forth was usually no issue for supply shipments, personnel had been a different story. Not to mention the freezing temperatures that had plagued every one of the advisors as they prepared to reach Reichskommissariat Moskowien. But, as the Oberleutenant knew, comfort wasn't the priority of the Reich, was it? The train coming to a screeching halt painted a picture of his platoon's desperate stand at Bremen while he fought for Speer's succession. Exiting the train, he took one last look at his pocketwatch containing a picture of his wife before stepping off.\n\nThe rumbling of the train made it hard to hear anything else, but for the Oberleutenant, the marching of boots managed to triumph the surrounding area, as more and more soldiers within Moskau prepared themselves through the bustling streets, as if the whole city was on the move. "Oberleutenant Vogt?" called a distant voice, grasping the Oberleutenant's attention as he came to see a young Leutenant saluting him. "At ease, Leutenant. You're here to bring me to my station, correct?" Vogt said. "Aye, sir, please, follow me, sir." prompting the young officer to face about and begin walking alongside Vogt. Everywhere Vogt looked, he only realized that the chaotic mess was growing, as dirtied Aryan settlers hurried to earn a few extra Reichsmarks whilst platoons of the Reichskommissariat's soldiers marched past. "Poor bastards never had it this hard, did they?" Vogt asked. "Not exactly, sir, preparations for a possible assault by the Russians has shaken up the lives of everyone in the settlement, though everyone is hopeful for the advisors that have come in." The prevalence of such "hope" did not appear evident for Vogt as he saw scared German children and fathers having to say one last goodbye before hurrying off with a rifle in tow.\n\nEventually, Vogt managed to escape the chaos-ridden frost as he entered his small office room within one of the military installations of Moskowien. To say that the ones present during the civil war in Germany were better was an overstatement, with staff tripping over themselves, rats scurrying down the hallways, and barely enough room to stand in. "Sir, command has issued that advisors are to aid in the training of divisions newly formed in the wake of the possible attack from the natives.

Breathe out. Fire. Reload, rinse, and repeat. Fix bayonets if the enemy got any closer. Had it not been that easy to operate the weapons left from the Second World War to prepare the Reichskommissariat for such an attack like this? Apparently fucking not, according to Vogt, given how this morning has gone so far. Fighting and killing fellow Germans felt easier than dealing with this catastrophe.\n\nIt was four in the morning when the battalion he had been assigned to start off with were finished lining up, with some of the men obviously not knowing what standing at attention meant. Lighting his cigarette, Vogt yelled out, "Men, my name is Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt. As I have seen blood spilt within our homeland through war, so too now do the Russians seek to spill our blood to retain their damned power, looking to unite against our families, our Fatherland! And as proud Germans seeking to do their homeland proud, we cannot allow this. Today begins your training for when you face the frontlines, in the reality of which some of you will die. However, that is not the concern now. Today, you shall become true workers of the Reichskommissariat, true soldiers, and true Germans. Now, first platoon of the first company, mount the firing range."\n\nVogt's inspiring words seemingly died in his eyes as the men lined up for weapon training. Some of these men hadn't touched a rifle in years, while others hadn't done so at all, and only worked the farms while producing large families, as the Reich had given permission to do so. None had known the true brutalities that were to come, as Vogt had seen during the civil war, especially when some of them barely figured out how to slide the bolt open. However, the worst came when the men had finally regularly begun firing at the targets when a shower of blood splattered across the field, some staining Vogt's coat, with screaming following. Men rushed over, and saw one that one of the recruits shot themselves in the hand, nearly blowing it off; however, despite the horrificness of the situation, the man managed to retain as much composure as he could, even firing off a joke or two in the process.\n\nVogt knew the truth of the situation: the man shot himself in order to get out of service, in order to escape the horrors that everyone else was bound to endure. Yet, the Oberleutenant knew the truth of it all, that he couldn't shatter the mens' spirits knowing they had cowards in their ranks, and chose to send him away to deal with later. Afterwards, the men along the firing line simply stared at Vogt."

In times past, it represented the strength of the empires long past within German history, having served as a symbol of perseverance and courage. Now, as Vogt knew all too well, the symbol flew as to represent the Fatherland, along with the battalion of conscripts and volunteers within the newly formed "Adlersgruppe," charged with protecting their friends and families from the Russian onslaught that inevitably stormed its way forward. As the men continued setting up defenses in some backwater village to the south of Moskau, they continuously talked about potentially being called heroes on their return home. The word "hero" brought a whiplash of pessimism for Oberleutenant Vogt, nearly distracting him before the sounds of one of the infantrymen being torn apart by submachine gun fire exploded out.\n\nA period of shock-ridden silence boomed, until screams in Russian came from across the town, and the Germans hurried to their assigned positions, with Vogt's orders starting to become drowned out by the incoming gunfire. Chunks of concrete came flying off of surrounding buildings, some even tearing apart the faces of the new recruits, as they continually battled in the streets, with bullets flying and the blood of both Germans and Russians showering the air in a flurry of fire and gore. Vogt had known the terror of guerilla warfare for years, and now, as a Russian truck with a light-machine gun in the bed firing down into the Germans, Vogt had the chance to utilize his experience. With cries drowning the air, Vogt shouted at some of the closest men to him, "Find your strength men, now's our time to make the advance! Unteroffizier Breiner, take some men and gather the explosives! Unteroffizier Kranz, gather some men with me and we'll surround the truck, it cannot-" a bullet interrupted Vogt's speech as a rain of gunfire forced him to find better cover. As he regained his defense, the only thing the Oberleutenant saw when he laid his eyes on his men were the same emotions portrayed by his brothers-in-arms during their time fighting for Speer back in Germany. The same emotion that came as the feelings of heroism faded, and the chilling shadow of death crept closer and closer, with every comrade lost to another bullet, whether it's fired from a Russian or a German.\n\nTerror.\n\nWiping his face some more, Oberleutenant Vogt shouted "Fall back, fall back! We'll find another way around!" as the German soldiers began to retreat in the face of the overwhelming firepower from the Russians. They may not be heroes, but they didn't need to be heroes to deserve to live another day, to Vogt, anyway."

But Vogt could never have expected the brutalities to rise so quickly: the amount of mass executions, the killings of deserters, those once considered to be comrades in fighting against the Russians, the viscera, all had come crashing down upon the volunteers in such a short period. Much to the respect of Oberleutenant Vogt, while it all seemed difficult, the men continued to march forward past it all; that is, until the Burning of Ryazan.\n\nAs the Adlergruppe marched southwards from Moskau, pushing deeper into Russian territory "in the defense of the Reich's' rightful territory,'' the men had already become surrounded as the urban battle exploded. Sure, the men got their first taste of battle in a village, but this was an entirely different story as the concrete buildings and structures hid enemy Russians behind every corner. Constantly, squads of enemy soldiers seemed to appear as phantoms in the dark, pinning a few squads of the Germans down before they finally dealt with the issue. This was, until Alpha Company, led by Oberleutenant Marzell Vogt, entered the courtyard of an apartment complex to secure the area, and became pinned down by heavy enemy fire from all sides of the three-sided building. The men rushed to cover or died trying to do so, with the screams of fellow Aryans dying in the stony courtyard filling the air, as what seemed like the endless Russian supply of lead came raining hell upon the company. Vogt was left with no other choice but to hold out as he continuously pleaded for air support from local German air wings, who promised "immediate combat support."\n\nIt took a seemingly endless five minutes for the screams of the German jets to overtake the slaughter, as the Gates of Hell seemed to open up from the heavens above and consume the apartment complex. The men watched along in horror, some trying to get up and move as the fiery napalm they pleaded for arrived, sticking to the enemy soldiers who threw themselves off the multiple story balconies to escape the horrid fate of burning to death. However, as Vogt thought the horror was over, it only multiplied in size, as the outer doors of the apartment complex opened up and a flood of burning men, women, and children came screeching out of the complex. Only some had been armed, but none cared any longer, as they peeled away at the flesh and bone that melted away from the deadly German napalm, with mothers holding their children, hoping for an end to the madness. Eventually, all had either died from the flames or were killed out of mercy by some of those within the Aldersgruppe, who had all seemed to shock and terrified to be able to respond to any other orders from some of the superiors.\n\nThe nightmares that night consumed Vogt's mind. Flashbacks to that last stand at Bremen stormed his mind only to reach a burning conclusion, with the flooding of anachronistic burning children and women into the once-heroic battlefield, causing the Oberleutenant to rocket from his dreams every hour of the night."

"Yes, I'm, I'm home now." Marzell said, as Marina felt her husband's hand shake.\n\nHours had gone by, and yet, the newly returning husband still remained...odd, according to Marina.

Realizing her husband was nowhere in sight, she grabbed a letter opener they kept on the desk before entering the kitchen...where she found her husband, with glass shards shattered across the table and ground, whiskey, which her husband swore to never drink in his career, spilled across the area, and a bloodied hand carrying a pistol kept from service. Marina dropped the letter opener on the ground as she approached her husband, asking "Marzell, oh god, what's wrong?"

And within one small compartment, the bustling and rocking of the powerful locomotive hardly shook the work Walther Viktorow had prepared. Viktorow sat excitedly, tapping on his briefcase filled with documents and procedural forms as he stared out into the Western Russian wilderness, completely losing track of the outside world as the train came to a screech, and the city streets filled his view. Finally, after so much wrongdoing against the harrowed Russian, Viktorow knew that the time had come to make a difference in the world, even if the greatest trial awaited him, and he had one thought which dominated his mind:\n\nMoskau awaits.\n\nHowever, as Viktorow exited the train, accompanied by a group of German guardsmen straight from Germania, the full force of the trial would strike as he looked around the train station. Everywhere, men, women, and children, all with bright, beautiful blue eyes, and adorned with flowing golden hair, all looked as if they had come from a German slum. Exhaustion colored their faces while callouses covered their hands, with some appearing frail and hungry, and all adorning ragged clothes that would bring disgust to most German higher ups. But Viktorow did not want the prestige or class of higher up, this is exactly what Viktorow wanted, even if he could not stand the pleading eyes of the settlers here. At the end of the day, they were the Reich's citizens, and as proud as they may be, they were suffering, and Viktorow knew that he, as an ambassador on behalf of the Reich itself, he could not allow this any longer.\n\nAs the snow landed atop his cap, the toy of a young child bounced across the street in front of the capitol, nearly prompting a guard to strike the child, were it not for Viktorow's intervention. Handing the child his toy from next to Viktorow's feet, the diplomat said a few simple words to the boy: "Do not be afraid, things will change here soon." as he looked onwards to the capitol building of Reichskommissariat Moskowien, as the recent clashings of Germans and Russians flooded his mind."

Improvements regarding the stability of the transportation systems between the Reich and the Reichskommissariat could potentially be looked into; however, if anything, the difficulty presented in the transportation systems is a small look into the situation within Moskowien. Politically, the situation within the area appears stable enough to not withdraw supply efforts towards the settlers of the area, nor do any reports indicate a collapse for the Reich's influence within the area around Moskau; however, living standards have fallen dramatically for the Aryan settlers within the Reichskommissariat as well as native Russians. Outbreaks of conflict between native Russian populaces and the settlers arriving from Germany proper has caused considerable detriment for German settlements, and Russians within the area have suffered as well, despite the advancements made within the area. In this regard, although living conditions have plummeted for all parties within Moscowien and the surrounding Russian nation-state, the populace has espoused supreme loyalty towards the Reich itself, and in an effort to support the German and the Russian within the area, the developing situation has been taken with the greatest priority for our diplomatic envoy. Thus, actions towards the advancement of OPERATION: GREATWHITE will begin immediate implementation within the interactions between Reichskommissar Kasche's successor, native leadership within the newly established state for Russians outside of Reichskommissar Moscowien, and the diplomatic envoy you have assigned me to, and transportation to the capital of the nation-state of the Russians will be arranged to aid our mutual efforts through a hopeful admittance into the Unity-Pakt. To the glory of the Reich.\n\nWalther Viktorow"

 speer_moskowien.42.d:0 "Luckily, the Moscowien government had been more than cooperative with Viktorow's work over the past few days, and has granted his convoy protection and given him absolute clarity and comfort regarding their business in the capital and preparations for negotiation. Viktorow knew that as the days went on, the time before he'd venture forward to meet with the officials of the Russian nation grew shorter and shorter; yet, despite his excitement for the eventual departure and work, everything left him confounded in the reasoning behind the excitement.\n\n"Excuse me, Dr. Viktorow, but the convoy has been prepared for transportation," a young secretary said as he had missed her knocks on the door.\n\n"My apologies, Miss Berchow, right away," the diplomat said, as he grabbed his suitcase and followed her out. Everything around him had showcased what he enjoyed, the order, the structure of it all, and now was finally his time to make a difference. Time to make a difference that his predecessors of the past did not, he continued, thinking of the pictures of his family he kept so neatly tucked away back home in Germania. The carvings of the beautiful little box delighted Viktorow, in contrast with the contents, as he saw capturings of the times of a Russian family working its hardest to get through the wall set up by German forces. How great the suffering his grandparents had faced as they crossed over into the new land of Germany, and the dreaded persecutions that the Viktorovs faced being foreign immigrants in a hostile land. But no more, no more crushed dreams nor broken souls from either side, as each and every hardworking German and Russian around Moskowien has earned their right to support from the Fatherland, and earned an end to the troubles which plagued them.\n\nViktorow continued his thoughts as he finally made it outside the capital alongside his fellow statesmen and the Waffen regiment accompanying them deep into the Russian land. The frost encapsulating the trucks reminded Viktorow of his grandfather and grandmother as the convoy began to move away from Moskowien territory."

 speer_moskowien.43.d:0 "The soft rumbling of treading through dirt and snow tore apart into harsh rocking and bucking by the envoy's truck as it met hard gravel amidst that sounded like it would tear off the tires at any minute. As the entourage continued onwards, the silence slowly transformed from an excited admiration of the Russian land to a dreaded silence, with each rotation of the tires bringing another wave of confusing tensions as the Waffen guards present in Viktorow's truck prepped themselves. It was confusing to Viktorow, to say the least, until the trucks finally passed through the iron gates of the city.\n\nThere, peering through the windows of a heavily armored truck, Viktorow, for the first time in his life, received a glimpse as to what his grandmother and grandfather escaped all those years ago: the glimpses of children roaming the streets without parents in sight, in rags, fighting over a piece of bread which had been stained by the mud of the ground. Across the street, Viktorow caught glimpses of three men beating another fellow Russian on the ground, pummeling him with bats, punches, and kicks as they strip him of his bag and coat and duck off into the alleyway, passing by a duo of nurses carrying a body covered with a tarp out of a health center. The homeless had grown in number as he saw groups of armed men harassing a young woman coming out of her home, seemingly asking for overdue money owed to them, and Viktorow could only pray for her safety as the convoy moved on. Viktorow continued to think and debate with himself as to what had become the fate of the Russian people, what could have done this? Were the politicians in charge of the state that greedy, or was there some sort of crisis causing all of this? Viktorow continued to pray for the hope that things had not been completely this way for his ancestors.\n\nAs the motorcade came to a halt outside of the capitol building, Viktorow continued to dust himself off and grab his briefcase as his eyes locked onto a peculiar sight: a little girl, no older than seven, grabbed at the chain link fence as she continued to stare at the Germans inside. She looked thinly, and had only dirty rags on, yet her brown eyes glimmered in the snow, reminding Viktorow of the daughter he always wanted. That was, until a little boy began to chase her for the bread in her hands."

 speer_moskowien.44.d:0 "As the grandfather clock in the corner of the room continued to tick, the weight upon Walther Viktorow's shoulders seemingly doubled. He stared into seeming nothingness, as the words upon the transcripts laid out in front of him blurred, all the man could see was images of his days within the surrounding area. The desperateness and near predatory nature of some of the groups that had formed outside of the Moskowien territory, how could the self-governed area fall apart so quickly, yet the room he sits in remain so lavish?\n\nSuddenly, the wrinkled face of the anti-Soviet himself, Bronisalv Kaminski entered the room, offering a nod and handshake to the diplomat.\n\n"Brigadeführer Kaminski, it is an honor to meet you. My name is Dr. Walther Viktorow-" Viktorow started, before being cut off by Kaminski.\n\n"The diplomat sent by Speer, huh? We've been waiting for your arrival. What's the terms?"\n\nViktorow hadn't pictured such exhaustion from Kaminski, but then again, all of the area has been a surprise, hasn't it? Viktorow took out the first report in the file, and began discussing the Führer's desires out of Kaminski to pay for the incredible amount of support issued to the native state via the ceding of Brauchitschstadt and a swearing of loyalty to the Unity-Pakt.\n\nViktorow's seemingly hopeful words brought him to look up, only to meet the image of Kaminski hunched over the desk, both hands clasping his face.\n\n"They'll march in and hang me...joining the Unity-Pakt...the natives, they've given..."\n\nAnd finally, as if a sledgehammer broke through a castle made of sand, everything came together for Viktorow. The terms, the ceding of territory, the governmental lavishness, yet the hopeless and the butchers remaining outside, this wasn't Kaminski's misdoings: they've been paying everything towards the Reich. They couldn't stand on their own, they needed help, and now... It suddenly dawned on him: Operation: Great White. Viktorow wasn't serving as a negotiator here, he was a predator: a loan shark.\n\nIn the end, Kaminski, with eyes that seemingly had the life sucked out of them, shook to the agreement of losing Brauchitschstadt and joining the Pakt. With every step, from leaving the capitol building, to walking to the trucks, to staring out the windows as they rumbled out, Walther Viktorow felt one thing alone: the eyes of starving, broken Russians."

Meeting with BRONISALV KAMINSKI retained success within the notions outlined in OPERATION: GREATWHITE, as the native state has agreed to cede Brauchitschstadt to the direct control of the German Reich while issuing a submittance of willingness to joining the Unity-Pakt in support of Germany proper in exchange for the cancellation of debts owed from the local government towards Germania. German settlers retained celebratory feelings over the success and technical end to conflicts against their Russian neighbors, as local reports showed demonstrations of praise regarding the Reichskommissariat's government. Outside of Moskau, reports of Russian citizens' outrage over the terms of KAMINSKI'S agreement have been issued to local media outlets, with even some factions within Brauchitschstadt reporting direct obstinance towards the notions of direct annexation by the German Reich proper. Overall tension within the area remains to be seen, as continuous data has been feeding into the Reichskommissariat's office to measure the success of the terms. Within personal reason and experience, it is within bounds of my personal measures to report that OPERATION: GREATWHITE provides immediate successes for the German Reich; however, continuous documentation will be required to measure long-term successes. Insofar as measurements reach, the continuous losses of the native populaces following the Second World War, the Western Russian War, and now the loss of Brauchitschstadt and the diplomatic alignment with the Unity-Pakt may offer a fostering point for native resistances. In dearly recognizing the sufferings of the native populace, current success estimates remain at a current situated level of IMPROBABLE."

 speer_moskowien.46.d:0 "War never means peace for a foreign ministry, no matter how far removed from the conflict. Helmut Schmidt had become all too familiar with this. A pound on the door outside his office served as the fifteenth reminder that day that the world after Hitler was still a chaotic maelstrom of politics and blood, a great typhoon in which Germania was the eye of the storm. Peaceful for now, but surrounded by disorder on all sides.\n\n"Come in, come in."\n\n"Foreign minister, a report from Moskowien. I'm sure you'll find it fascinating reading."\n\n"Thank you. You're one of Gehlen's boys, with the RND?"\n\nThe young man opposite him remained silent, and smiled coldly. Schmidt internally rolled his eyes and took the paper from him. "Very well. Off you go then."\n\nWith a short bow, the man left. Schmidt stared at the paper in front of him. 'Kaminski victorious', a newspaper clipping on the front read. Ah, so old Brinislaw had won out against the German settlers. A bad situation for Germany, perhaps, what with the whole legacy of a totalitarian Reichkomissariat and all leaving a sour taste in Russian mouths. Still, Schmidt thought it was perhaps preferable to Von Dem Bach or one of the other wretched Nazis patrolling the ruins of Russia. If not for his government, then for humanity as a whole.\n\nHe filed through the papers, and one stood out particularly. An intercepted telegram, between one of Brinislaw's men and some sympathetic Russian national in Lettland. Now this was interesting. Seems Kaminski had become convinced the best way for his Moscow autonomy out of the chaos enveloping the rest of Russia was a negotiation session with Germania's finest. Perhaps Schmidt would see the best of both worlds, then."

 speer_moskowien.47.d:0 "Germans and Russians had just about always been wrapped up in each others' business. When the Empire still controlled the Baltic states, the Germans there had been kept as something of a nobility. Schleswig-Holstein, back before the Wilhelmine era, had been a land controlled by an offshoot of the Romanovs. Fate still has it that the Lord of Europe and the fractured Giant of the East will forever be woven together in a tangled tapestry.\n\nSchmidt arrived in a country town in Western Moskowien by plane. Russian troops lined the streets, eying down the foreign minister's convoy as it moved toward the central bar, which had seemingly been refitted into a political centre of operations for Kaminski's forces in this region. Schmidt was confident that he was safe; the Heer around him was equipped with better weapons than these peasant conscripts, that was for sure. Either way, blood spilled today would not be the preferable option.\n\nNegotiations were over lunch. Shashlik, Pelmeni and even Chicken Kiev. Schmidt didn't have Russian cuisine often, but it remained one of his favourites on the continent. Beyond the food, Schmidt was impressed with Kaminski. The man spoke German well, and seemed cultured in literature and philosophy, something that even in the supposed 'world capital' politicians often lacked. The man's taste was clearly in the sciences, however, but Schmidt was capable of holding basic conversation on the scientific feats of Tesla through to Braun. Schmidt liked Kaminski, and it seemed the favour was mutual.\n\nA minor tremor in the conversation was felt. Schmidt let it be known that Brauchitschstadt, or what the Russians still call 'Leningrad', would be directly administered by Germania. The city seemed to hold sentimental value to the old soldier opposite him, who had served his time with the Red Army before Stalin's purges. Lenin was still an admired figure.\n\nDespite this, Kaminski was still willing for the negotiations to move forward. Even with the administration disagreements, Kaminski admitted that he felt aligning his new Russia with Speer was the right thing to do. Schmidt couldn't agree more."

His brows furrowed. "Herr Schmidt, would you repeat that for me please?"\n\nSchmidt felt his heart sink as he realised what he had done. "Perhaps the Heer might take an advisory role in the new Moscow government, if you would be so willing."\n\n"I heard what you said the first time, I was just checking to see if you were the rat you appeared to be." Kaminski sighed. "You know, Schmidt, out here in the East, people call you a hero. There's optimism that you might be something different to those Nazi scum who run your country. That you might be an angel on Speer's shoulder, and you might do something genuinely good for Russia, or even the world."\n\nSchmidt watched as the man opposite him stood from his unfinished lunch. Kaminski faced away, equipping his coat as he continued. "No man is immune to propaganda. I read an American minister talk about it, and you know Schmidt, I hate the Americans, but this one had a point. 'Propaganda makes puppets of us'. It has made a puppet out of you. My blood might come from Warsaw, Minsk, and the very soil this building stands on, but do you think just because I am a Slav that I am stupid?"\n\n"Take yourself and those uptight pricks in uniform behind you back to whatever fucking hell you came from." Kaminski's glare penetrated Schmidt, and the Russians left the room. Schmidt slammed the table once the door had shut. War had come again."

Send my best wishes back to the RND with you."\n\nThe young man saluted, and exited the room. Speer was left with a folder of documents pertaining to the breakdown of the recent partition in Moskowien. Ah. Erich von dem Bach has claimed victory, or so the clipping at the front of the folder would have the Führer believe. Perhaps his Cyrillic was a bit rusty, but flicking through the rest of the documentation suggested that this was the accurate outcome.\n\n"Finally, some good news," Speer muttered to himself. A loyal Wehrmacht general sat in Moscow now, and the Führer could see no reason why resistance was even conceivable. He picked the phone up from his desk.\n\n"

As good a place as any for diplomatic arrangements. Perhaps more importantly, Erich von dem Bach hadn't seen his hometown for years, and so Schmidt thought it might be beneficial to arrange a meeting there. The bewildered old soldier was guided by the foreign minister into the party office building that had been reserved for the meeting. A table was decorated with a grand lunch for Moskowien's interim ruler. Wurst, potatoes and plenty of beer. "Schmidt, this was unnecessary. Thank you."\n\n"Anything for a fellow German on the homebound flight. Now, down to business?"\n\nAt Bach's nod, Schmidt began. With an apology, the foreign minister revealed that Bach's position would be filled by Alexis von Roenne, to which Bach was seemingly compliant. Additionally, the Reich would directly occupy Brauchistschstadt, and create a new german settler state in the Southern Volga region. To both of these territorial changes, Bach was quite amicable. "Happy to do my duty, sir."\n\nSchmidt smiled to himself. If he knew this was going to be so easy, he would've started drinking much earlier."

Schmidt thought he'd have hated Bach, but the man was honest and kind. They had been alone for some time, and Bach admitted his Kashubian heritage, which no one in the party, he was sure, knew. Sometimes, in Bach's weaker moments, even he doubted the party. Schmidt felt he had met a kindred spirit. The deal was sealed with signatures, and the men departed home.\n\nSchmidt didn't like night time flights, so he was staying in Lauenburg til the morning. He sat up in his hotel bed with the folder the RND had given him. It was a dossier on Bach, and although he had considered the diplomatic sections with great detail, he had only skimmed the personal section. Schmidt's eyebrows furrowed as he glanced over a section tabbed as 'Activities before Moskowien', detailing the man's actions before the war. Schmidt felt his heart race. The man he had joked and drunk with just hours earlier had been responsible for the murder of hundreds of thousands of innocents, and these were only the documented ones. In Operation Hummingbird, Bach had personally killed several in the SA. Then there was his horrific career in the SS, which Schmidt had heard of but never actively considered.\n\nNo one in this Reich was innocent. Not even the kindest of faces, or the warmest of voices. It was just Schmidt, and Schmidt alone, dancing with the murderers that had destroyed his father's country. He felt his eyes begin to tear up, but suppressed the urge to cry. He had done too much of that recently. At least the deal had gone smoothly. Another nation returned to the Unity Pakt for his favourite murderer, the Führer."

The host complimented the scientists on their results, expressing his "great appreciation" for the progress made in the fields of electronics and industry, of engineering and military. "With your keen intellect and your selfless dedication to the Reich," he stated in a speech at the end of the banquet, "you not only ensure the Vaterland's greatness and the continuation of the dream of National Socialism, which should already be a satisfying reward for true patriots such as yourselves.

At one point, the Führer interrupted the barrage: "Minister, please stop! Are we truly in such a state? Has the Reich really fallen behind so much?"\n\n"Please come with me mein Führer"\n\nAs the two moved to the window, the Minister pointed at the cars: "Do you recognise them?" and that was enough to answer. To his consternation, Speer saw that most, if not all cars and trucks passing were models ten - if not more - years old. Looking with more attention, he also noticed details he had missed when looking outside in the past weeks: patchwork reparations to the roads and sidewalks, electric cables hanging from scrambled-together power lines, public phones scattered because the people had no telephones inside their homes...\n\nRight at that moment, as if to confirm that indeed, the situation was dire, all lights went out in the office, and the surprised voices from outside the door made it clear that it was a general blackout.\n\nThe Führer fumbled around to his desk, suddenly dejected, and sighed.

In a very similar room in Germania, the central hub of NetzRAM had been activated, and the network spanning the entirety of the Reich was officially active.

Though there was something strange about the way they got all that info, and how suddenly it was, as well as how detailed it is.\n\nGiven the information, however, they had to check it out - and so the Antifa members came down to the street where the students were marching that day, and while one side met the other with warmth, it wasn't initially reciprocated. One of the Antifa members decided to pull ahead of their group and begin shouting. "Klaus Becker!" He shouted, and one of the students raised their hand, moving forward. "We're told your father is a veteran pilot in the Luftwaffe, and that you vote for the NSDAP. Are both of these things true?"\n\nThe silence was unpleasant. It was broken, however, when Klaus let out a laugh. "Who told you THAT?! My Opa is a retired electrician, and I've never touched a ballot in my life! Goodness... if you don't believe me, I'll be happy to show you my father's certificate!" That chipped off some of Antifa's initial weariness, and as more students were asked, more of these nonsensical facts were debunked.

With a smirk, he motioned for his fellow officers to draw their batons as he walked in first, casually opening the door to see six hooligans all gathered around a table, and their attention was turned to him and his gang almost immediately. One of them, a woman, spoke up. "Who are you?" She asked, already becoming worried. Stefan grinned. "Who do you think?" He countered.

"Or would you like me to show you what it means to enforce the law?"\n\nA painful silence dominated the space between the two for a few seconds, before one of the students eventually conceded, stepping out and looking frightened.

These infiltrated assets probe the ground for potential new recruits, and direct Infiltrator so that he can convince them of the students' cause. While extremely dangerous, this also presents us with an opening: as Infiltrator has no way to keep his converts under surveillance, it won't be difficult to plant false information to steer their action in a way benefitting our ultimate goal.\n\nVorschlag: counter-infiltrate the web, arrest Infiltrator."

Analyzing data concerning the rallies organized and led by Firebrand, one thing stands out: unlike her comrades, the suspect constantly pushes an outrageously large agenda, ranging from the aforementioned women's rights, to democratization, abolition of slavery, resignation of the Führer, tax reductions, free schooling, to name just a few. Far from the ravings of a lunatic, this seems to be a precise strategy: while the others try to present demands that the government could abstractly keep into consideration, Firebrand knows that her requests are so extreme that no one will ever be able to accept them, and uses refusal as fuel to attract more followers.\n\nVorschlag: curtail Firebrand's followers, prevent other rallies, arrest Firebrand."

From there, it's easy for the suspect to turn the outrage into a large retinue for her rallies.\n\nBericht B, agents Neu and Alten.\nUpdate on Bericht A.

With everything that had been happening, this year's Reichsparteitag der Macht was a sensible target for the students, and everything needed to go smoothly. For about half an hour, the NSDAP officials spoke from the stage, then everything changed.\n\n"Agent Buch to team Recht, large counter-rally sighted in Karolinenstrasse, it will collide with the Reichsparteitag in 5:00 minutes!" came the worried voice, immediately followed by his colleague: "Agent Gesetz, another counter-rally sighted in Brunnengasse, colliding estimated in 3:00 minutes!". Immediately, agent Burgerliches took his radio: "Wachtmeister Bröhn, we need Orpo reinforcements at Hefnersplatz! Unauthorized student rallies colliding with the Reichsparteitag!" he said, and immediately came the answer "Received, we'll send our full complement!". Now all they had to do was wait and pray.\n\nIn the end, the Orpo came, but not before the two manifestations turned into a large brawl with dozens of injured, and hundreds of arrests.

With each gatherer celebrating came another member of the German state supporting the NSDAP, meaning everything had been going according to schedule. Even as the liberalized students gathered, protesting the might of the German Reich, the situation was generally handled, as the RND had been able to take control and limit interruptions, even with tensions rising. Nevertheless, the people, although fearing the liberals lurking within the shadows, expressed genuine support for Germany, controllingly, with reverence, with genuine care and concern.\n\nHowever, the gathering of counter-protesting students continued to grow, each crying out over their cares, their damned desire to tear apart the slave system or "stop the German war machine." As the kettle of tension boiled, all it took was three squeezes of a finger to turn the situation into a disaster, as a certain Josef Bachmann, what would be another teenager joining students, shot one of the student leaders identified by the RND, Rudi Dutschke. The first bullet entered between the shoulder and throat, pushing Dutschke back before the second bullet struck, travelling along the side of Dutscke's skull and brain before the final shot tore straight into Dutscke's head, sending a splattering of blood and brain matter across the students as he fell, dead.\n\nWith a section of the guards attacking Bachmann, and Dutscke dead in the arms of his student comrades, chaos reigned. The students broke through the barriers, smashing straight into the rally as several dozen more guards rushed to the scene. Students began to beat guards over the head with clubs, bottles, and bricks, whilst guards responded with gunfire, gas, and armored vehicles. The rest of the events of the rally were canceled as the massive riot of the students endangered the image of the presentations, along with all those supporting the NSDAP present at the rally.\n\nThe city of Nuremberg was placed under lockdown and martial law following the events, searching for the rioters as the German military scoured the city, strictly enforcing rules of curfew and containment. Meanwhile, the Reichsbanner held the gall to support the protests, declaring Bachmann's actions as having been "An orchestrated attack on the leadership of the free speech movement in Germany.""

 speer_rnd.46.d:0 "The solemn ink of the newspaper held in his hands brought a storm of vengeful anger into the mind of Gerhard Wessel, as he stared into the shuttered window of one of the biggest offices of the Reichsnachrichtendienst. Finally, after catching a few breaths Wessel walked in, greeted by the watchful eyes of around a dozen of Wessel's subordinates, leaders within the intelligence organization, and commanders of several agents of the RND. Some of these men had been there at Nuremberg, some of them their agents. But to Wessel, one thing remained as he walked up to the podium.\n\nNone were innocent from what happened.\n\n"It is not of my nature to scorn my men, nor render any of you all as lowly or failures. However, in addressing the events of the rally for the Reichsparteitag der Macht at Nuremberg, we must recognize a certain degree of failure amidst ourselves and our department in the handling of what happened, and our preparations for a potential conflict. Now, it is our duty to ensure that we can resolve what happened, and where to go from here." Wessel said, as his men looked around, uncomfortable. For the next hour, Wessel scorned them, ensuring each and every one that they would be responsible in the investigation of the incident, now that the world is watching them.\n\n"Herr Gehlen, I'm hoping this is a sufficient hour for you, sir." Wessel said, entering the smoke-filled office of Reinhard Gehlen. "Of course, what is it, Wessel?" Gehlen asked. "Well, sir, it's in regards to the Nuremberg incident. Bachmann's still in custody, and, quite frankly, we need to find out why he shot Dutschke, what if someone's backing him?" Wessel said. Gehlen took a long drag of his cigar, looking at his desk, before uttering with a puff of smoke, "What makes you think anyone else is involved? Could be some fucked up kid after all." "It just doesn't make sense, he's a young kid, small criminal record, doing day jobs, why on Earth would he shoot a political ideologue?" Wessel responded. With a chuckle, Gehlen said, "Huh, well, if you ask me, some of those lowlifes can get all wrapped up in the SS's business, when there's nowhere to gun, men run to the occult. I'd start your search there." Wessel was taken aback, the Ordenstaat? Would they really bother shooting a student leader, just for disagreeing? While doubt rushed to his head about Gehlen's statement, he was interrupted by a young intelligence officer slamming open the door, with an urgent look in his eyes.\n\nJosef Bachmann was found hanged in his cell. A crudely drawn mark of the Schutzstaffel was marked on one of his coat's sleeves, with Gehlen all the more exuberant over his claim of Burgundian guilt."

 speer_rnd.47.d:0 "It had been over a week since the "suicide" of the assassin, Josef Bachmann. A whole week of thinking, pondering, and questioning occurring within the mind of Gerhard Wessel. The customary Schutzstaffel "lightning bolts," Gehlen's quick assumption of the influence of the Ordenstaat, the lack of proper investigation. Wessel, a skilled and experienced investigator, knew that the answers lied within the body, within Bachmann. And yet, everytime he approached the idea, bureaucratic shifts of resources and reorganizations of priorities for the department swept up any attempts.\n\nThe ever-recurring wall of smoke hit Wessel like a wave, only to calm back down and reveal the face of his ever-diligent superior. "Good evening, Herr Gehlen." Wessel greeted. "The same to you, Wessel. Now, a late hour in the night, coming into my office, what's pricked your mind tonight?" Gehlen responded. "Well, Herr Gehlen, I just have some, well, issues in the Nuremberg investigation, but I believe I have a solution. You see, I understand your hypothesis; however, it appears too convenient, or even that we may have overlooked pieces attached to Bachmann that could lead further in any direction. Nevertheless, I believe a formal reinvestigation of Bachmann's body could allow for some, well, advances. Unfortunately, the proposal has been shut down due to other matters of the office becoming, well, randomly prioritized, and I believe we need to focus the investigation." Gehlen said, squashing the cigar against the ashtray on his desk. "Bachmann had clear ties to Burgundian authorities, it's as clear as day upon the man's very clothes. You wish to tell me that it could somehow be something completely different? We have many things to worry about in the RND, reopening a closed case is not one of them, Wessel." Gehlen said, frustratingly, as he lit another cigar.\n\nFury bore into Wessel's body. How could his superior, the man he's respected for so long, suddenly act so obstinately to his pleas? This wasn't right, not at all. Lifting his office phone, Wessel said, "Wedekind...Kessler...to my office, please."\n\nThus, a plan was hatched. A plan for the agents to break into the morgue, to investigate Bachmann's corpse, pictures and all, and bring it all back to Wessel. Wessel could not allow whatever was plaguing the RND to simply scurry away."

 speer_rnd.48.d:0 "Two weeks had gone by, all according to Wessel's plan, before any meeting between the three conspirators of the intelligence department. Late at night, once Gehlen left early to attend his usual reservation at some Germanian restaurant, and all that was left in the office was Wessel, Wedekin, Kessler, and enough illegally obtained information to have the three men locked away for the rest of their lives. With all the lights in the office shut off, and all window shutters brought down against the night sky, the meeting began.\n\n"Wedekind, Kessler. I respect your commitment to the cause we have put together; however, I wish you two to know the legal ramifications of all this. This could easily be what leads us to an early death in a Germanian heavy containment facility. I will be more than happy to allow you to leave and never speak of your involvement again. Do either of you wish to do this?" With the men's eerie silence, and constant stares at Wessel, an understanding agreement was made, and the bag was unzipped to reveal the products of the break-in. Photos, documents, and physical evidence all spilled onto the table.\n\nEach of the photos revealed the harsh, red marks upon the throat, with finger marks all up and down the assassin's throat, with rough scratches and blood trickling down the corpse. Meanwhile, the autopsy report provided even more suspicion regarding the case of death for Josef Bachmann. The primary medical examiner involved in the autopsy of Bachmann had been Dr. Heinz Felfe, who had grown closer and closer to Reinhard Gehlen during his career in the RND, which brought things closer to Gehlen, of course. However, the most damning piece of information dawned in the mind of Gerhard Wessel: Heinz Felfe had been in Kyiv for a criminal autopsy.\n\n"Someone forged these documents." Wessel said, in shock. The two men nodded, Kessler burning through a cigarette in the meantime. "Someone is throwing off this entire investigation. Someone powerful." The questioned remained however: should he intend to pursue whoever is throwing everything off, or would it just lead to their deaths?"

What should have been time to see friends, loved ones, or co-workers, instead was spent looking at photos of a dead gunman, and a counterfeit autopsy supposedly performed by a man hundreds of miles away. And yet, the documents kept showing more and more proof for Wessel.\n\nAs he stared at the documents, rushes and waves of doubt filled Wessel's mind, as the typically astute, focused, and efficient man turned inwards to paranoia and fear. The man who fought so diligently beside him, as a father, Reinhard Gehlen, and yet his name was plastered all over the investigation, whilst his words covered falsified information and throw offs from the main investigation. Was it true Gehlen? No, it couldn't be, this man was loyal to the Reich, why would he throw things off for a genuinely efficient information bureau that had trusted him dearly? Wessel's minds wandered throughout the worries and doubts of the world, as his entire career up to this point became jeopardized with the notions working in the midst of treachery, while other times it proceeded to become laser-focused on the difficult matter in front of him, looking for any potential leads and openings into this dreadful case of treachery and dangers around every corner. Suddenly, the familiar smoky odor alerted Wessel as he put away the material into his desk and Reinhard Gehlen came in.\n\n"Good afternoon, Wessel. Here, you got some departmental mail regarding last month's procedures and some ways we're looking to improve, figure you may have some worthwhile input, after all." Gehlen said, flashing a smile at his subordinate before leaving. Wessel's tired, sunken eyes could hardly stand any more bureaucracy, when his hands ran along the curious material of the rubber stamp attached to the envelope. That's when an idea hatched in Wessel's mind, and he cleared through his desk to gather the documents, and each of their attached envelopes. Each had a similar rubber stamp, in fact, on closer inspection and magnification, Wessel realized they were all the same: the stamp of Horst Wendland, Vice President of the RND."

They were not the focus.\n\nThis was where Horst Wendland made his base of operations for the day, and Wessel received quite the good news about the state of it. At some point in the afternoon, Wendland was scheduled to have dinner with one Hermann Ludke, an admiral in the Kriegsmarine. Why an admiral and the vice president of the RND met up was unknown to him, but he had his musings on the matter. Still, he wasn't here to spy on them. In fact, quite the opposite.\n\nIn Germany's decadence, many officials slacked on caring about having paranoia-levels of security wherever they went. Wessel had fully expected Wendland to be just like his superior, but clearly he was mistaken. And thankfully so, otherwise this would've been a fruitless endeavour. A report was leaked to Wessel and his team, brief and to the point. Wendland's main documents were stored in an apartment on the other side of the city, and that the only real security was the hotel staff.

With short radio telecommunications at hand, the agent was slowly guided to the room Wendland had made himself comfortable in, and, after dodging another guard and spending about ten seconds picking the lock to his room, he was in.\n\nThe agent quickly found out that something was off. A large, black object was hidden in the corner of the room, draped in clothing and backed behind a chair, but anything above a passive glance could tell that it didn't belong there. Remembering how the clothes were originally placed, the agent took them off and uncovered... a safe. After relaying this information, some surprise was felt from Wessel's side, but it quickly faded away as he considered his options. There were two, each with their pros and cons.\n\nThe first was to simply bug the system. Wendland was not a very competent nor careful person in Wessel's eyes, so he highly doubted that he would spot that his safe was bugged. It would give easy access to whatever was heard inside his room, though the contents of the safe itself would not be directly uncovered to him.\n\nThe second was to blow the damn thing open and run like hell. It would throw all caution out of the window and make Wendland certain that he knew someone was tracking him, but as long as the contents inside are worth it, the reward would outweigh the risk."

Tell some of your agents to move the files somewhere else by the end of the week. Yes, tell them to go to Leverkusen, and-"\n\nLetting go of the button, Wessel looked up at the agent. "And that's all that's important?" He asked, and the other man nodded. Wessel stood up to his full height and gave the man a a brief nod back.

Thankfully, the entire process was far less troublesome than any pessimistic expectation he had. There were no dramatic encounters, only an empty warehouse with even emptier contents. It took them ten whole minutes of searching before they found something. In a boarded-up room, one of Wessel's agents found a table with documents and tape recorders.\n\nInitially he sent an agent to examine it, but after just a minute he returned to Wessel and told him something that stopped him in his tracks and made his ever-professional facade break for a moment. Asking the agent to guide him to the room, Wessel was left alone with the contents on the table, now laid out at his disposal.\n\nHe played one tape recorder, then another, then another. They all played back the same voice. His own professional demeanor reverberating back at him. And occasionally, another voice joined in.\n\nGehlen's- and the contents of these discussions were all about Büro Wessel and its activities. Something beyond Wendland's reach. This was no petty crime, and as Wessel left the room, his mind began stirring. It was impossible that Gehlen let his vice president run amok so freely, taping conversations. Even for a man as bizarre as his superior, he didn't consider him to be that incompetent - and so the worry in his mind refused to go away as he and his agents abandoned the warehouse and wiped any trace of their presence clean."

He only wished that blowing their cover - literally, in fact - would have been worth it.\n\nPapers and files, cases and documents. All things Wessel handled gently, but all things that served no purpose to him in the end. They were all about other things not related to the Büro Wessel, or Antifa, or the student protests. Frustration that was present in his mind only grew throughout the night, until after about half an hour of searching, there was nothing.\n\nExcept the one thing yet to be researched.

In his office, he was handed the developed film by an agent of his who hadn't looked at it, and then promptly left the office, leaving the man by himself. From the top, he uncovered his thumb to look at the first picture of the set, and...\n\nWessel felt his heart drop. On the first picture - the very first - there was an image, clear as day, of something being pictured against a wooden table. On a closer glance, he could make out the markings and the design. This was no ordinary document. This was a document that belonged to the Büro Wessel. Then another picture - this time it was open, revealing its incredibly damaging contents inside. While his face was stoic, his mind was in a whirl.

He asked back, and Wessel merely stared at him further.\n\n"What reason did you have for taking pictures of top-secret documents belonging to the Büro Wessel?" His was a voice of stone, betraying nothing, but those familiar with it could make out the invisible intricacies. The purest sense of anger.

Tremors ran down his limbs, and he couldn't help to stop the incessant shaking of his head, telling him to look away. "God, no, please, I can't-I don't..." He trailed off, and Wessel raised an eyebrow. Would he finally speak? He was almost about to feel some relief when Wendland suddenly shut his eyes tight and made a strange noise akin to a grunt and a gasp, as his head rolled back. When Wessel saw that, his stance broke, and he muttered the slightest 'no' before shouting an order for his agents to come over."

 SGR_RND_58_ukraine_investigation_d:0 "The office was small, yet well furnished with dark woods and plush rugs. Gehlen's desk put them almost at opposite ends of the room, yet Wessel kept his voice low regardless. "Felfe had indeed infiltrated Chornovil's group, and was aware of my presence in Ukraine, but he had no intentions of ever contacting me. He was killed in a firefight with another group - mercenaries of some sort."\n\nReinhard took a drag of his cigarette. The corners of his mouth tightened ever so slightly. "And you thought it necessary to attempt to contact him, to risk his mission, a mission your Büro had no part in? For all you know, you led these men right to him."\n\n"No. This was a coordinated, pre-planned attack. I was lucky to even see him alive." Wessel noticed the smallest twitch as Gehlen responded.\n\n"You spoke with him?"\n\nCurious. "No. But I overheard enough. He was a double agent. He had been feeding them information ever since he joined. Why?"\n\nReinhard leant over the desk and ground his cigarette into the crystal ashtray. "You seem to forget who is debriefing whom, Herr Kätzchen." Gerhard internally grimaced at the all-too forced codename. "I do not like what you imply. Felfe was a traitor, and his treachery caught up with him." He looked pointedly at Wessel. "You are not privy to the details of every operation this organisation performs. I suggest you get used to that fact."\n\n"Verflitzes Kätzchen" glowered, though his face remained a mask of patience. As he wished. If "Kleiner Fuchs" wanted to play his cards close to his chest, so could he. He would stay in his lane - but where his Büro's lane went was his business."

 SGR_RND_58_papertrail_investigation_d:0 "Gehlen could almost make out an emotion in Wessel's face when he nigh slammed the pictures on to his desk. He remained deathly silent as his number two agent spoke. "Agent Kleiner Fuchs," he began, betraying nothing but the slightest annoyance. "These," he continued, pointing fingers at the pictures in front of Gehlen. They were... damaging, to say the least. Proof that Wendland had taken pictures of top secret info that only Wessel's agency would have access to. "What are these, sir? How did the vice-president of the RND get these images? Not only that, he committed suicide via a cyanide pill when questioned about it."\n\nGehlen, after a long period of silence that only served to further annoy Wessel, sighed. "Agent Verflitzes Kätzchen..." He began, pushing the pictures towards him slightly. "These questions shouldn't concern you. They should concern me." He said, voice tightening slightly. "I know the trigger for his suicide. When you asked him about who these pictures were for, correct?" At that, Wessel's breathing became just a bit heavier. "Are you looking for something, Agent... ? A sort of... conspiracy, perhaps?"\n\n"Sir." Wessel returned, staring with an attempt to scan Gehlen's emotions. They were not pleasant. "I am not making any claims. I just want to find out why Wendland took these pictures, and why he committed suicide. If I can get the help of the RND..." Gehlen shook his head. "No, no, no. Agent, you misunderstand. I never requested that such a thing like this be in your portfolio when I gave you your own agency." Gehlen's frown turned into a light smile, and Wessel felt like he wanted to grab on to something. "This is not your problem to deal with. It is mine. I suggest... downscaling your ideas of what you should do and realizing what you should not do." He could see the emotions begin to rise in Wessel's eyes, and that was his call. "Leave it to me, Agent.""

The bracing wind forced him to pull his coat closer to himself, and he quickly entered the black Mercedes awaiting him. "Pleasant trip, sir?" The agent sat opposite him proffered him a file, and gave a tap on the glass between them and the driver. The car pulled away with a purr.\n\n"As good as it could be in this weather." Gerhard opened the file. He had read it before but he preferred to commit information to memory. Paper was unreliable. "Where is Felfe located. The sooner we find out what he knows about the autopsy, the better. "\n\nThe agent looked down sheepishly. "I'm afraid we've been unable to locate him, sir. As soon as I arrived I swept his known hangouts, but by all accounts he hasn't been seen in over a week. We searched his home top to bottom, but no luck."\n\nWessel gave an almost imperceptible frown. The agent's head lowered further. He had expected complications, naturally - complications were nine tenths of his work. Without Felfe, however, this lead was a dead end. Felfe was apparently only person left to have seen the autopsy report, and the fact he hadn't already revealed it indicated he was saving it for someone else.\n\nThe car slowly pulled its way through the streets of Kyiv. It was a difficult task - the roads were potholed and clogged with a mixture of ancient Soviet vehicles belching smoke and imported German cars, seeming all the more grimy for their spots of gloss black. The signposts were a confusing mixture of German and Ukrainian - both in Cyrillic and the bastardised Latin script that had developed from the confluence of cultures.

His agents had redoubled their search of the city - not just for Felfe but for any subversive that might harbour him or hurt him. He had done some searching of his own, wandering the city. It was remarkable what you could learn just from walking the streets, visiting the bars, finding the feel of people.\n\nNaturally, the Ukrainians and Russians remained churlish against the Reich, with many a drunken curse raised against the Germans. While his agents had indeed determined the presence of local resistance movements, both left and right, they were not his concern. No, it was what he had found in an alley behind a decaying beer hall that disturbed him.\n\n"Einigkeit und Recht und Freiheit". Not words he had expected to hear in this place, the severed half of their national anthem. Well, one of them, he smirked. He tossed the pamphlet back to his desk, the black, red, gold seeming to glow in the light. Reichsbanner had beaten him here - a deeply disturbing prospect. He had expected locals, but for German insurgent movements to have travelled this far East?\n\nThis all but confirmed it - Felfe's previous mission regarding the Ukrainians was only a secondary concern to him. Felfe no doubt knew Reichsbanner had been here, but had never reported it. He had been compromised. A skilled infiltrator, Felfe would have attempted to worm his way into the local resistance. Gerhard knew not where to find Reichsbanner, but his Büro had leads on the Ukrainians. He would find the man, by hook or by crook."

 speer_rnd.61.d:0 "The Ukrainian Herald was a fascinating magazine, in that it seemed to have no author - an impossible feat for such a well read and subversive piece of literature. No claim that outrageous holds up to close inspection however, and a few smashed printing presses later revealed that the author, one Viacheslav Chornovil, occupied the deep forests outside Kyiv along with his band of outlaws. Chornovil was viewed as something of a Robin Hood figure by the locals, and had been a great disturbance in the region to Wessel's colleagues. Thus the Büro began its search, finding a remarkable lack of dissidents and a surfeit of trees. It was not until one agent quite literally fell into the answer, that they located a tunnel.\n\nOne geologist and several aerial surveys later, they determined the locations of the other entrances. Thus, Gerhard waited, lying under a pile of branches and camouflage netting. Two other entrances were monitored by his two best agents, and they had made note of the incomings and outgoings of the sizeable tunnel complex - more than two dozen separate people were noted. Wessel made a mental note to order any similar networks rooted out immediately. Through his binoculars, Wessel noticed motion. Glancing at the blurry photo captured yesterday, he recognised the moustachioed face of Viacheslav Chornovil clambering from a cramped tunnel, before sitting on a rock and lighting a cigarette. Gerhard exhaled sharply as he recognised the second rising figure as Heinz Felfe.\n\nGerhard cursed himself for the distance at which he had placed himself - overly cautious, he could not hear their words. However, a shared cigarette and a firm handshake could only imply a deal was being made. He was about to shift closer, when the crack of gunfire ripped through the morning silence."

Felfe lay at the edge of the clearing, blood already caking his shirt.\n\n"We were expecting you, Wessel."\n\nDespite his best efforts, Gerhard started at the use of his name. Chornovil rose, and gestured to his men to let Wessel stand.\n\n"Felfe told us many things. He knew you would come after him eventually. You spend too much time chasing corpses, Mister Wessel." Chornovil smirked - despite Wessel's trained expression, he knew he had struck a nerve. This was undoubtedly not what Gerhard had predicted. Felfe had revealed infinitely more than he expected, and certainly not out of incompetence. "I will admit, I did not expect this attack. I presume it was not your doing, yes?"\n\nGerhard scowled. It would be smart to remain alive - and it would be smarter still to understand why he was allowed to remain alive. "Yes."\n\nChernovil stood eye to eye with Gerhard.

He was useful - pointed us at the right targets, helped us shake off pursuit. Of course, it was when he said he could put us in contact with Spartakus that I knew he was something more. He is half the reason we are still alive. Almost a pity."\n\nGerhard paled. "Spartakus is a myth", he argued, but he didn't quite believe it. Chornovil chuckled.\n\"I thought so too, until I spoke with him. I didn't think a German could be that genuine an ally. It seems as though you are not as well informed as you think."\n\nWith that, Chornovil apparently considered the conversation over. He marched back to the tunnel.

 speer_rnd.66.t:0 "Spy vs Spy"
 speer_rnd.66.d:0 "Maintaining the flow of information was Wessel's job. No decision should be made without the most complete knowledge of the situation possible, and it was the Reichsnachtdienst that kept these channels of information open - or so he had thought. It seemed Reinhard had fallen into that old spymaster's trap, the hoarding of knowledge for his own sake. It was therefore up to Wessel to restart the flow.\n\nTo the untrained eye, the headquarters of the Reich's foremost intelligence agency was just another office building. Cleaners have a unique ability to go unnoticed in a crowded room. All too easy for a loose sheet of paper or a cassette to fall into the bag while its owner was preoccupied. A microphone concealed within a lampshade might be noticed in an office, but nobody would even consider searching for one behind the bowl of a toilet, and conversations become less formal when one has their fly undone.\n\nGerhard now enjoyed the fruits of his labours in his office. The unmarked cassette was playing into a pair of headphones. The fact that this tape existed at all was damning enough, but the contents disturbed him greatly. The recording was of a phone conversation - at one end Gehlen's crackling voice; the other, the unmistakable tone of their Führer Albert Speer. He listened to it to its completion, then removed the film from the tape, concealing it within an empty bottle of pills. Gehlen was a true rogue agent, at the head of one of the world's largest intelligence agencies. Reinhard was smart, and revealed much while demanding nothing - nonetheless, Gerhard could recognise the hint of extortion.\n\nTruly, nobody was without sin - Gerhard had known many of the darker secrets of the Reich, but could only hypothesise whether Speer had been party to them. If Gehlen revealed any of what he had found, the Reich would collapse in on itself. Speer had buried his past deep yet Gehlen found it nonetheless. A stark warning of what he was facing. If he was to act against Reinhard Gehlen he must act fast - for the safety of the Reich that his mentor had so clearly forgotten."

There were only a select few he could trust with this information - he could only pray he would reach them before Gehlen realised what was missing. He marched through the office floor of the Büro Wessel, giving dismissive nods to those who met his gaze.\n\n"Excuse me, Herr Kätzchen? I have a message for you."\n\nGerhard turned to see a man in dark sunglasses. The man extended his right hand with a slip of paper, clearly expecting him to take it. His left was lazily resting in his coat pocket. Wessel reached into his pocket as though reaching for a pen; his eyes darted from side to side, establishing the visitor was alone. The man's eyebrows furrowed, and the corner of his mouth turned as he realised his bluff had been called.\n\nWessel pulled his penknife from his pocket all too slowly, as the man's left hand emerged from his coat holding a slim pistol. In one smooth motion the man's arms straightened, the oversized suppressor brushing against Wessel's ear as he jerked to the side. Its detonation nonetheless deafened him and threw off his balance, and he fell into the assassin in a tangle of limbs. A blind thrust of the blade made contact and he stabbed, the knife finally connecting with the man's throat.\n\nWith a gurgle the man in sunglasses expired. Wessel arose, clutching at the side of his head. The bullet had grazed his skull, and from what he could tell taken most of his left ear with it. The shot had roused the rest of the Büro, and Wessel had to slam down the telephone of a wide eyed secretary who was in the process of calling the Orpo. Whatever number was dialled next, Wessel could guarantee it would not be the one that picked up.\n\nHe barked out swift orders to leave. His Büro had planned for a situation similar to this, though he had never thought they would ever be implemented. His staff would scatter, and the Büro would go dark. He, however, had a meeting to attend. If Speer was compromised, he had to find the next best thing. Exiting through his own secret door, hidden in a den of electrical wires and transformers, he turned up his collar, put on his hat and made for the Reichskanzlei."

He attempted to piece together the recent events in his head, whilst he had a moment of peace.\n\nDutschke's murder had been the flashpoint, and Gerhard was now all but certain Gehlen had ordered it. Further still, Bachmann had been eliminated to throw Wessel off the trail. Gehlen's Büro had been hoarding secrets, making hidden contacts, selling information that was not theirs to sell. They had actively been working against Wessel's own agents from the beginning. To what end? And most damning of all, Gehlen was extorting the Führer himself - one last insurance policy in case the depth of his double-dealing came to light.\n\nHow had this happened? Reinhard Gehlen was an intelligent man, one Wessel had looked up to. Now, Gehlen had sunk to sending hitmen after him in broad daylight. He was sloppy, out of touch, and most of all he could not be trusted. Trust was everything in their business - who to trust and distrust decided who was alive and who was dead. He turned to look out of the window, and glimpsed a dull red glow.\n\nHe shook off the protesting doctor, and went to the window. In the distance were the party rally grounds, the great theatre in which the NSDAP had performed their ecstatic rallies ever since Hitler took power. In the centre was the Ehrentribune, the vast podium wreathed with swastikas from which he had spoke and yelled and cried, which to many represented the golden days.\n\nIt was burning."

If slavery were to be abolished at once, the Reich would collapse, for few Germans had maintained the skills required to manage an industrial economy. Of course, this message went unheeded by the slaves themselves.\n\nKZ Monowitz, a work camp producing synthetic rubber for IG Farben, had suffered in productivity this last month. The predominantly Polish workers had attempted a campaign of passive protest, gathering in their hundreds and refusing to work until their demands were met. These demands had included increased rations, shorter working hours and the right to contact their families outside in what was once Poland.\n\nUnfortunately, these demands had not reached the capital by the time the protests had been dealt with. The camp guards, some of whom had been dealt a beating before being expelled had received encouragement from the camp's management in IG Farben, and with support from the local Orpo force bloodily retook the camp.

Attempt to cordon them in one block and they acquired a supernatural knowledge of the way out. Reports from one end of the city of spontaneous riots would turn out to be false leads, allowing further damage in other areas. Every time they attempted to contain the protests they found some way around, creating the constant background of yelling that seemed to encompass Germania these days.\n\nDamnation, but Reichsbanner was good.

While all were reluctant to send in the army, it had been accepted to use off duty servicemen and party members in old police gear. Still, the line seemed all too thin.\n\nHis investigations had been slow. These protests were organized - radio frequency scans had revealed encrypted transmissions of a type that none of his cryptographers had been able to break yet. That the code would be broken was inevitable, for his Büro had unofficial access to the largest supercomputers in the Reich - the question was, would that be soon enough? If Reichsbanner were responsible they were proving smart enough that more than likely they would have shifted to new frequencies and new codes by the time they RND had broken the encryption.\n\nHe allowed himself a cigarette - a rare luxury. Addiction was a weakness, but it had been long enough that he didn't care. Whoever was behind this had funding and brainpower, enough to stay that one step ahead.

The post-mortem examination confirmed that Muller was shot in the back of the head. The results had not been published, and the internal investigation had soon been called off.

He'd heard of information gathering operations in Germany, and rumours of operations in the USA and Japan - today he'd been informed their networks extended across the former Triumvirate, the Reichskomissariats, China and Indonesia, virtually every theatre of conflict on the globe. RND operatives had been unable to uncover little of their operations other than their presence, and the fact that wherever Burgundian agents went, chaos and destruction soon followed. He'd heard unsubstantiated reports that they were behind virtually every political assassination in every country in the past twenty years, and partisan movements across the globe had been noted to carry arms bearing arms traced to the Silent State.\n\nThe motives for these operations were still unknown, with a single shred of concrete information from stolen SS documents in Italy sent before their mole went dark - the operations all contributed towards Himmler's Globalplan. Why? What twisted plan did the Reichsführer SS have that required murder on a global scale?\n\nWessel picked up his phone, and started making calls."

speermilitary.2.desc:0 "To the people who had been looking at the victory parade after the end of the last war, it must have seemed ludicrous to even think that the German military supremacy over the entire world could ever falter, even in a thousand years: sadly, as most things human, all it took was a couple decades. Without the threat of a powerful enemy, corruption and infighting began tearing the Wehrmacht apart in what historians would probably call "a twisted parody of the Late Roman Empire"\n\nLike the Roman generals they were so fond of, the highest German officers bought the loyalty of their men by promising hefty bonuses at the end of their service, siphoning the needed funds from the Reich's budget with the subtle threat of open revolt should anyone refuse them. As a result, the Wehrmacht bloated horrendously, eating more and more of the public expenses and contributing to the final collapse of the German economy. The increase in dimensions, however, didn't result in a better military: on the contrary, overloaded logistics, unfit recruits, outdated equipment and infighting between officers turned what was once a jewel of efficiency into a wheezing sick patient, as the Second Russian War showed perfectly.\n\nNow, with the civil war over, Von Tresckow has planned a large reform of the German armed forces to return them to their former glory. The program will concern all of the Wehrmacht, from the Heer, to the Luftwaffe, to the Kriegsmarine: everything will be turned upside down, until it fits his ideals once again. However, this won't be an easy task: many officers of the old guard are still in active service and will try to resist the reform at all costs, especially if they are supported by the conservative elements of the NSDAP. It seems this battle will be far more political than expected..."

The German air force was the personal playground of Herrman Göring, the man responsible for the current decadence of the Reich, and a large number of officers owe their rank to him: despite his defeat, his political clout is still present, and it will take time and effort to remove it before any real reform can be passed without mass desertions or worse.\n\nGöring's influence, however, wasn't limited to the officers, but it covered even the doctrinal aspects of air combat. As of now, our air fleet is heavily unbalanced towards long-range bombers - the result of a decade-long bombing campaign over Russia and Western Africa - and even worse, due to the gargantuan costs of running such a meaningless operation, there weren't enough funds to develop new airframes to keep up with the new discoveries.\n\nAs a result of this, the Luftwaffe is extremely outdated in both doctrines and equipment, despite its large numbers, and will most likely perform with abysmal results against any modern air force of the world."

This exponential growth, however, overloaded the supply system until it finally broke, and only served to enrich the weapons industry in cahoots with the military leadership.\n\nWith the constant downturn of the German economy, more and more money was diverted towards maintaining this living corpse - the mere thought of cutting military spending was met with subtle threats of civil war - with the result that any kind of research or improvement was halted due to lack of funds. Poorly-trained soldiers, outdated panzers, malfunctioning aircraft and old doctrines were the reasons for the collapse of the German defenses during the West Russian War, but not even this was enough to let the corrupt High Command understand the depth of their mistakes, and the Heer continued its decadence.\n\nWith the civil war over, the Heer has been left reeling from its losses and from the difficulty of serving once more alongside those who mere months before were manning a machine gun aimed at you. This, however, is also the perfect time for reform: Von Tresckow has a clear idea of what he wants the German army to become, and he won't stop until it has become reality. This, however, might be difficult, as several prominent generals and field marshalls, chief among them Ferdinand Schrörner, will try to stop him at any cost."

The West Russian War saw spelled even more cuts for the navy as the generals took more and more funds for their pet projects and to feed the bloated monster that was now the army.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out, the Kriegsmarine sided with Bormann, but Dönitz decided to retreat to Crimea, realizing that no matter his allegiance, there was no way the navy could do anything except getting either sunk or scuttled.\n\nDespite surviving the war almost untouched, however, the Kriegsmarine is in a dire state. Years of neglect have left the navy small and obsolete, with most ships dating back to the last war: as things are, a total overhaul is needed in both doctrine and equipment, to bring it back from the dead and turn it into a modern fleet. Despite the resistances of admirals formerly close to Dönitz, von Tresckow knows a new and powerful Kriegsmarine is necessary if Germany is to return at the forefront of military innovation."

On one hand, we could go the safe route and focus on infantry weapons: better rifles and grenades will have an impact throughout the entire Heer, no matter the unit or doctrine. Another choice is artillery: gone are the times of giant railway guns, now self-propelled weapons and light, infantry-portable mortars are the way forward, improving mobility and efficiency of the support units. Some wish to improve the support echelons of the Heer with better logistics, modern engineers and advanced medical detachments to fully aid our troops in their task.

When the officers of the Wehrmacht started siding with this or that pretender, swearing their loyalty to their frontrunner, they caused a bloody civil war that caused untold amounts of victims.\n\nNow, some reformist officers wish to fully detach the army from the party, even more than what the new leader desires, and the first step would be to replace the oath of loyalty to the Führer with a more neutral oath to the nation and its institutions. While these officers aren't showing any sign of disloyalty, and will accept any decision on the matter, it's evident that this will have repercussions on the larger political debate: already the reformists within the Reichstag call for a comprehensive reform to remove any political influence in the army, while the conservatives are trying to stop what they call a "dangerous push towards anarchy"\n\nAs the government is called to decide on the matter, what will the Führer do?

Given the predisposition of Berlin and the unnaturally lethal tone of the message, we have been given every reason to believe that they intend to make good on their promise.\n\nOur forces - those that will follow our orders at least - are being made ready, though none hold the delusion that the Reich's warmachine could be bested. Perhaps, however, they will not have to be. Given our geographical position and relative miniscularity, it is unlikely that they would bring to bear the entire Wehrmacht against Madagaskar. As such, if they send a proportionate force it is possible to resist and make a quick invasion turn into a grueling exercise in hubris.\n\nBut even so, not even our most optimistic officers expect this assumption to prove true, as the Germans are just as likely to rain ordnance on our heads until we throw down our weapons or die in the process, and it's likely they don't much care which outcome arises first. Ultimately, the ruthless calculus of war has a habit of reducing one's choices.

When their reply was not made ready quickly enough, an incoming fly-over of the island by our bombers served to catalyze a faster response. As of right now reprisals are planned, but we are working to ensure that sufficient control of the islands and the surrounding waters are achieved first so as to avoid any last-minute complications; even as we are past the point of armed resistance, we intend to avoid the possibility of further issues arising.\n\nThough ownership of Madagascar and its islands is important to the dominance of those southern seas, the true fruit of this endeavor is the public image of a once rebellious land willfully submitting to the rightful rule of our administration.

The islands of Madagascar not only project vital power along the African coast and the Indian Ocean, but by allowing it to fall to a - ultimately suicidal - seperatist force has resulted in a poor image for the Reich.

Therefore, if they seek to become an example to others, then we shall make them one.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine has been notified and is being made ready to leave their moorings to prepare for the invasion, army groups are being formed and instructed on how to retake the island, and munitions are already being tasked to air-elements in the region to soften it for our arrival.

He took off his hat and deposited it on the desk, then saluted and left the room without a word."

speermilitary.24.desc:0 "The city of Nuremberg was chosen as the site for the trial of the surviving disloyal officers who had committed crimes against the nation in their service to the traitorous secessionists. Chief among them was the traitorous admiral Karl Dönitz, who had fled from Germany with the majority of the Kriegsmarine to find refuge in Crimea. After the end of the war, the admiral surrendered himself when threatened with retaliation from the new government in Germania. His hopes of keeping his rank were shattered a few months later, when he was formally accused of treason and dereliction of duty, and tried together with several SS members and generals who followed either Göring or Bormann.\n\nWhen the day of the verdict came, Dönitz stood with the other defendants in the courtroom. The judges entered the room, one by one, and then read the final sentence: the admiral didn't listen what had been decided for the others, though the amount of screams and cries told him that convictions were far more than acquittals. Finally, it was his turn, and it took all he had not to join the rest of the accused in their screams: "The court declares Karl Dönitz, chief admiral of the Kriegsmarine, culprit of treason and dereliction of duty, and for this he is sentenced to be stripped of all his ranks and decorations, and to thirty years of detention"\n\nAs the guards stripped him of the signs of his rank, he didn't protest, and when they brought him away in handcuffs, he didn't even try to resist. He simply followed, his head low, shame radiating from him like the stench of treason he emanated."

A suitable location - a hill surrounded by a small forest near the coast - had been labelled "enemy fortification" and suitably equipped with bunkers, tents and mock emplacements containing old machine guns and artillery pieces. At the given signal, the combined might of the Wehrmacht was unleashed upon the unfortunate earth mound.\n\nThe Kriegsmarine opened fire upon the enemy positions, neutralizing anti-air batteries and grievously damaging several other emplacements. Immediately after, bombers from the Luftwaffe dropped their deadly cargo upon the trenches, anti-tank cannons and machine guns, clearing the way for the Heer. Tanks rolled towards their target, and infantry both motorized and on foot followed in their wake to occupy the objective. Thanks to the radio coordination, there were no instances of friendly fire, and the entire operation was declared a success.\n\nFor the entire time, Henning Von Tresckow looked with a satisfied expression at the scene unfolding a few hundred meters from his command tent. Several other members of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht - generals, aviators and even a couple Kriegsmarine officers - were present, all murmuring their approval for how the army reforms were having their desired effect. The Prussian general allowed himself a smug smirk: everything was going as planned."

#USA-SPEER EVENTS


SPEERUSA.1.t:0 "The Meeting"
SPEERUSA.1.desc:0 "It was rare that official letters were passed between their governments, usually restricted to under the table negotiations when they communicated at all. This situation called for an open hand however - and a letter penned by an articulate one.\n\nThe Führer lowered the paper and set his gaze on its author who stood before his desk. Reichsminister Helmut Schmidt had shown eagerness at the prospect of reaching out to the Americans. The letter was good - stately but not too domineering, eloquent but not flowery. The letter was not the question. The Americans may have sent arms back when he was directing mobs of students, but now he was at the helm of the ship, who knew what they would want? "I'm sure I don't need to impress upon you the importance of this summit. You represent "\n\n"I do. The Americans want things to cool down just as much as we do. They'll have their demands, but I don't think they'll be unreasonable with our country's history of walking out of negotiations." Schmidt gave a bitter smile.\n\n"Give them what they want, I suppose." Speer glared at the telephone as if anticipating it's angry ring later. "Just be reasonable."\n\n"
SPEERUSA.1.a:0 "Of course, mein Führer."

SPEERUSA.2.t:0 "Meeting in the Dark"
SPEERUSA.2.desc:0 "Schmidt took a deep breath. This was big. Really damn big. He could not, under any circumstances, put simply, fuck it up. The Americans had actually afforded Germany an opportunity to reach out, and he would damn well take it with open arms.\n\nAs he sat down with the American ambassador, he could notice that he was an older man who seemed to radiate an aura of joyfulness around him. Not a bad pick. Hopefully cooperative.\n\n"Greetings-" His English was sharp, lightly-accented. "- Ambassador. Walter C. Dowling, was it? I'm Helmut Schmidt." He gave the man a hand. "Pleased to meet you." Who then shook it heartily.\n\n"A pleasure, Schmidt!" A noticeable Georgian accent, but it passed by Schmidt's foreign ears. "I'm happy that the Reich's finally reaching out." He gave a short chuckle. "Getting concerned that things would get hot."\n\nSchmidt shook his head. "Not at all, Mister Dowling. The new regime is quite open to change. Now... this won't be easy."\n\nThe tension faded into reality. Both of them knew where this conversation had to lead. Dowling gave a short nod. "Yes... I hope you've come prepared. The negotiations that the United States has in mind will not be easy to compromise on. Agreeing to this would be a historically unprecedented move, especially considering the Reich's past." Schmidt's expression darkened, but Dowling did not hesitate."

SPEERUSA.5.t:0 "Americans Say Yes"
SPEERUSA.5.desc:0 "Helmut had held the letter in front of him as though it were a trophy, and perhaps it was - but it was also a great challenge. Still, Schmidt was a capable man. "Excellent work, Helmut." The other members of cabinet gave the Foreign Minister a polite round of applause. Stifled coughs interrupted the backslapping, an unavoidable consequence of Schmidt's ashtray filled with cigarettes, along with Erhard's seemingly endless cigar. Speer waved his hand at a secretary who scrambled to open a window.\n\n"Where do you intend to hold this meeting?"\n\n"I imagine there'll be some back and forth about that. Somewhere neutral would be preferred, if such a place even exists these days. Iceland perhaps, though if we push we could get them to visit Hamburg. It didn't come out of the war too badly"\n\nAlbert suppressed the urge to mention the obvious fact that it was also Schmidt's home. He supposed the man could be excused a moment of vanity - capable as Schmidt was, Speer had been uncertain of his ability to achieve this meeting. There had always seemed to be something the man had been holding back, however - some fire in his eyes. Perhaps this was his chance to show it.\n\n"Then I wish you luck with the Americans. No doubt you shall need it." The cabinet gave a polite chuckle.""
SPEERUSA.5.a:0 "I do not rely on luck."

SPEERUSA.6.t:0 "Americans Reject"
SPEERUSA.6.desc:0 "Helmut eyed the letter on his desk. It had been delivered to the German consulate in Washington not a day after they had sent their invitation. He steeled himself and reached for his letter opener.\n\nIt was short, curt, to the point. They were not rude, did not even rule the possibility of a future meeting - but it was a no. A particularly definitive no, if he was correctly reading between the lines.\n\nHe dropped the letter and leaned back into his chair, letting out a heavy sigh. This would make things considerably more difficult. If America wouldn't give them a second chance... Scheiße."
SPEERUSA.6.a:0 "How am I going to explain this to Speer?"

SPEERUSA.7.t:0 "Let's Do This"
SPEERUSA.7.desc:0 "Helmut's long awaited moment had arrived. He leaned against the balcony and gazed over the lights of the city. Not a bad view, and certainly a welcome change from Berlin's - Germania's, he mentally corrected himself - progressively more ugly skyline.\n\nThis place might not have been the Führer's first choice for their summit, but Schmidt had managed to persuade him of the sense of the location without saying too much of the true reason. Speer would have wanted them brought straight to Germania to see his Volkshalle - the Führer thought himself a humble man but how he could stand to see that bulging growth of national arrogance every day, Helmut could not understand. The Americans would not like it, as much as they loved their monuments. Plus, it was fucking freezing in there.\n\nThe door opened behind him. The Reichsminister turned and gave a nod before the messenger could speak - the Americans had arrived. Helmut ground his cigarette into the ashtray that rested on the windowsill. It certainly was an amazing view. The lights of the old city, uncorrupted by the colossal yet crumbling architecture that seemed to define their Reich's recent history. He turned to the door as the voices began to carry up the corridor, reached into his jacket, and pulled out another cigarette."

The press is already there, God bless them, with the whole scene being filmed and broadcasted across the English and German speaking worlds. Out of the convoy, men in fine suits and ties smile for the cameras and enter into the hall.\n\nNervous energy buzzes around the room as the greatest diplomatic minds of the OFN and the Pakt sit opposite each other in the centre of the hall. Navigating the outskirts of the room, journalists take notes and official photographers snap the occasional picture. In the centre of the Pakt's delegation, a man puts out his cigarette and adjusts his tie, neatening his clothing to match his perfectly combed, greying-brown hair.

Talks began about perhaps expanding this to an international agreement on the subject, but for now, Germania will retain mastery of this legislation.

And though we are hardly naive enough to believe this could ever lead to the total erasure of the threat of global nuclear destruction, this move is absolutely a small step in the right direction.\n\nAnd, arguably more importantly, we are hoping that this significant goodwill gesture will be enough to persuade the Americans to restore full diplomatic relations and to end the embargo between the US and the Reich. We have refused the Americans' other two major demands, but even this relatively smaller undertaking is causing a humongous uproar among the military high command. It'd be nice if the idiots in the OKH were able to realize that engaging in diplomacy such as this de-necessitates the use of their fancy nuclear toys in the first place, but regardless this move is what's best for Germany so we will not heed their inane screeching."

SPEERUSA.20.desc:0 "While the most dedicated Nazis and hardcore social conservatives are likely to fearmonger about the potential slippery slope it causes, we have agreed to give the millions of slaves across the Reich a degree of human rights. To those in our administration who oppose slavery for economic reasons, moral reasons, or both, this concession is actually a major relief; because it is a move for the purpose of lifting the trade embargo between ourselves and the United States, those who would disapprove of our decision will be convinced it is purely for pragmatic purposes.\n\nConsidering America's own tumultuous recent history with slavery, we hope that this considerable change in policy will be enough to persuade them that we are worthwhile and ethical partners. Whether or not that is the truth is irrelevant as long as the Americans see us in that light, of course."

If we want to form strong economic ties with one of the world's foremost economies, it is hardly much of a sacrifice to guarantee the Americans first dibs on the bounty of products and services the Reich has to offer. This move will certainly make a restoration of trade much more enticing to the Americans, as it will undoubtedly be a huge boon for their economy and development. As it would be for ours as well.\n\nHopefully, this economic offer is enough to satisfy them, as we are effectively refusing their other two (political and ethical) offers. It's not like the US is a perfectly moral actor themselves, so who are they to judge anyway?"
SPEERUSA.21.a:0 "They probably care more about their imports than our slaves."

SPEERUSA.22.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and America First"
SPEERUSA.22.desc:0 "We have decided to give in to two of the three major American demands: we will somewhat reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile, and will grant the United States unmitigated priority trade access to the many goods produced in the Reich. While we have denied the request to grant our substantial slave population a greater degree of rights, these other two concessions will hopefully not be as potentially harmful to our social fabric and popularity. Of course, we are still experiencing a large amount of hostility from our military and from our few diplomats to non-OFN countries.\n\nmHowever, these sacrifices will ultimately be worth the heavy price, as the economic and geopolitical opportunities which would open up to the Reich if the Americans agree would be monumental. Therefore, we are simply awaiting the American response to our most gracious compromise."
SPEERUSA.22.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

SPEERUSA.23.t:0 "Slave Rights and America First"
SPEERUSA.23.desc:0 "In what is correctly being considered to be a very large concession, we have decided to agree to the American demands to grant limited rights to the millions of slaves working in the Reich, and to give the Americans priority trade access to all of our goods. Due to other geopolitical considerations, we have refused their third demand to reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile. Still, there is likely to be major opposition from the most ideological members of the party and the Reich at large, though we don't have much of a choice.\n\nWe chose to make these concessions because the benefits are predicted to outweigh the social costs; we must engage in more trade if we ever want our economy to recover! Let us hope that these policies are enough to persuade the Americans to engage with us, as we would be rather hard pressed to concede anything more. This is for the good of the Reich, and so it must be enough."
SPEERUSA.23.a:0 "A necessary trade-off."

SPEERUSA.24.t:0 "Nuclear Reduction and Slave Rights"
SPEERUSA.24.desc:0 "In order to appease the Americans, we have agreed to both reduce the size of our nuclear stockpile and grant limited rights to the millions of slaves existing within our borders. While we do expect major backlash from both the military and social conservatives respectively, we are fortunate enough that, in the long term, neither of these changes should cause serious harm to the Reich's social fabric or economy (provided we handle them with the utmost care).\n\nBecause of the significant economic gains we would be poised to make in the event the Americans do agree to open up trade with us, such a generous display of good faith will likely outweigh the costs. Additionally, many worrying reports regarding the extent of subversive political groups throughout the Reich suggest that there might even be a subset of our population which is strongly in favour of these reforms. Though that is hardly any consolation, since it is the resistance of people in powerful positions we have to worry about."
SPEERUSA.24.a:0 "Presumably this will be worth it."

Soon, he says, all Germans will have their lives improved with the end of the american embargo.""

SPEERUSA.29.t:0 "The City That Never Sleeps"
SPEERUSA.29.desc:0 "Upon arriving in New York City, Schmidt didn't know how to feel. He'd never seen a city like this before. It was cluttered with countless tall, imposing, and- frankly- ugly buildings that left a unique and indescribable impression which could be felt nowhere else on Earth. What was it? This city was so foreboding and yet so utterly charming. Why couldn't a single German city produce this sort of emotion in its architecture? It made Schmidt want to explore!\n\nUnfortunately, reality got in the way of Schmidt's daydreaming. An entourage of diplomatic staff awaited him, and Schmidt was stuck shaking their hands and exchanging pleasantries for what seemed like an eternity. But, Schmidt reminded himself, restarting relations with the United States was of the utmost importance and would lead to the betterment of living conditions for all of humanity. So of course, Schmidt buttered up every last staffer as much as he could without brown nosing, and even managed to engage in some legitimately friendly and amicable conversations. Hell, he even managed to crack a few well-received jokes. But once all of that babble was said and done came the sightseeing.\n\nNaturally, there was beautiful Central Park, flashy Times Square, the monumental Empire State Building, and of course, Lady Liberty herself (admittedly not as large as expected from a distance but still symbolically powerful). Interestingly, Schmidt at one point passed through a neighbourhood called Greenwich Village, apparently home to people and activities his colleagues considered "degenerate," though Schmidt never understood how people's private business bothered others. All in all, Schmidt had rarely had a more exciting day and was completely enthralled by NYC's alluring atmosphere."
SPEERUSA.29.a:0 "New York, New York: A hell of a town!"

SPEERUSA.30.t:0 "The City of Angels"
SPEERUSA.30.desc:0 "As the Luftwaffe VIP plane began its descent, Schmidt couldn't help experiencing a mixed range of feelings upon viewing Los Angeles's skyline. While it was no doubt impressive, it seemed as if it were a work of progress that had stalled and stunted over a decade ago. The abundance of military installations and vehicles surrounding the city's harbour reminded Schmidt that the Japanese occupation of the US's major West Coast Ports had likely crippled the region's industry and thus the growth of what was once the most impressive city on the entire Pacific Ocean. Of course, it wasn't like the Reich was in much better shape after its own self-imposed economic downturn and the Bürgerkrieg. "More lives being ruined by fascism. What's new?" Schmidt thought to himself. But voicing such opinions aloud would be just as damaging to his mission here as it would be to his career (and no doubt his life) back home.\n\nMuch more concerning than the quality of L.A.'s skyline was the quality of Schmidt's reception, consisting of some random, nameless bureaucrats whose names Schmidt begrudgingly decided he would eventually learn anyway for the sake of making a good impression. After enough obligatory handshakes and small talk to drive even the most shallow of aristocrats to madness, Schmidt was finally able to do some sightseeing. There was the lively Santa Monica Pier with an ocean view unrivalled anywhere in the continental Reich, the both elegant and exciting Griffith Observatory, from which Schmidt could see the famous Hollywood sign in need of repair, and the excessive Venice Canals (funnily, now the only Venice Canals thanks to Atlantropa, yet another Nazi failure) and all sorts of other wonderful, if slightly tacky, attractions.\n\nThe bounty of interesting sights was partially marred by Schmidt's necessary security detail, but what really bothered Schmidt was the lack of opportunity to gain a real and honest understanding of how the American people lived day to day. How else could he truly understand what sort of provisions the Americans would surely want in the re-establishment of relations? And, unlike his colleagues, perhaps Schmidt actually gave a damn about the lives of non-Aryan human beings. Oh well."

Yet, as he entered the stately White House grounds, Schmidt couldn't carry himself solemnly. He deserved to be jovial in front of the US president and the press. This signing was his success, and more importantly, a success for the downtrodden citizens of the Reich and the United States. Why shouldn't he appear to be happy on the outside, since that was exactly how he felt on the inside?\n\nCracking a gentle smile, Schmidt shook hands with the president amidst the flashing of the journalists' cameras, and together they walked along the North Lawn and up the steps beneath the building's facade. The president approached a podium standing on the porch and gave a rather run-of-the-mill speech regarding the value and necessity of the deal which was about to be officially signed. Then it was Schmidt's turn.\n\n"Don't worry, I'll keep this very short. We are here today because we have finally realized that we should stop shooting ourselves in the foot, and that it is better for us to cooperate. I assure all of you that some of our previous administration's, so to speak, policies which some might have found a little unsavoury are in many instances unlikely to continue in the same fashion as they have for the last several years. I believe that this is a period of drastic change, and just as today is unrecognizable to the world of 25 years ago, the world 25 years from now will be unrecognizable to us today. And so, we absolutely must ensure that our future is one of prosperity and cooperation, and of a higher quality of life for all of our citizens. This treaty is an excellent first step.

The United States is eager for our parties to come to an agreement for our mutual benefit."\n\nSchmidt smirked behind his face. Off guard and backfooted was how they needed them - diplomats could be so predictable when they fell back on their instructions. Of course he wouldn't have organised this meeting without having planned every moment himself. The issue was too important to be delegated. He gestured to the vast Mercedes-Benz that waited to shepherd them away, shining a glossy black from windows to tyres.\n\n"Of course, of course, but first you must see the sights. Hamburg is a truly beautiful place.""

SPEERUSA.34.t:0 "The Canals"
SPEERUSA.34.desc:0 ""In fact, Hamburg has more bridges than any other city in the world!" Schmidt had seemed laid back at their first meeting, but now that they toured his home town the man had lit up. He gestured grandly at yet another stately bridge arcing across the canal. Walter Dowling was the first ambassador to Germany since 1941 - in fact he was the first American to legally set foot on Reich soil in more than twenty years. They walked together, their staff about thirty feet behind. No doubt they were conducting their own diplomacy behind the scenes, while Schmidt and Dowling did their best to ignore the cameras strategically posed above them.\n\n"It sure is a fine place." Walter admitted. It may not have the great skyscrapers of New York, but the place had its own, subtler history. The great city hall overlooking the Alster, the towering cathedral spire, these charming canals - he knew he was being wooed, but damn if Schmidt didn't know how to do it.\n\nThey turned a corner, slowing to allow the lackeys to catch up. Schmidt reached into his pocket and pulled out one of those seemingly ever-present cigarettes. He offered one to Walter who shook his head - half the charm of the open city was its clean air, and he already had a splitting headache from the morning spent locked up in that smokehouse of an office with the Reichsminister. Walter turned to examine the brickwork, and came to face something he never thought he would see. He did his best to conceal his strangled gasp as a cough, only half succeeding - Schmidt turned to view the line of bullet holes in the wall, the discarded rubbish that littered it's base, and the bare earth turned to mud that formed a long stain stretching into the canal . The hangers-on rounded the corner as well, and Helmut took a long, long drag. Just when he thought he'd located the perfect route."

SPEERUSA.35.t:0 "The Gardens"
SPEERUSA.35.desc:0 "One of the most touching moments of the visit was when the delegation visited the restored Tropengewächshäuser, Hamburg's botanical garden. A painstaking effort had been made to bring them to their former beauty: old photos had been retrieved, and from them a team of experts had acquired the original plants and flowers from their exotic homes, and rebuilt the pavilions and paths scattered across what was once a place of peace and tranquility. Just like that garden - that was the message Reichsminister Schmidt was trying to convey - the entire Reich would slowly become a better place for everyone.\n\nEven though the plants were still very young, and the grass still had to cover all the new flowerbeds, the American delegation was impressed by the effort. That is, until a diplomat stumbled upon a small earth mound while exploring a more secluded part of the garden, dislodging a few stones and revealing what was buried right below.\n\nAt first, Helmut Schmidt was annoyed by the commotion, but as soon as he turned away from his conversation with the ambassador, any trace of mirth disappeared from his face along with its color: barely hidden under a thin layer of earth and stones, was a human arm, its decomposed flesh barely covered by a tattered uniform, dried blood stains still visible on the discolored fabric. The workers were called, and they soon started digging: the first corpse was carefully set on the side of the hole, but immediately under it, another appeared, and another, and another. Despite all the prayers running through Schmidt's mind, they didn't stop.\n\nAs the sun started setting, one hundred and fifty-eight bodies clad in military uniform had been unearthed, and now the entire American delegation was turned towards the pale, heavily-sweating ghost of what was once Helmut Schmidt. The ambassador looked at him sternly, and his words felt steel-cold to the Minister, like an executioner's blade on his victim's neck: "Explain this, Mr. Schmidt. Now." and the answer he received was..."

Upstanding German citizens had transformed the Emperor's Hall into a magnificent dining room, and the tables were set for a great roast dinner, with plenty of drink on the sides. The Krauts and Americans began with a great conversation on cultural comparisons and personal anecdotes, but stalled for a good half an hour as the head of the delegation and the Führer himself engaged in a fierce argument over the differences between capitalism and national socialism. After some time, the foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, stood up and managed to reconcile the opposing interlocutors.\n\nEven if Herr Speer and the delegation may not see eye-to-eye, Schmidt showed that there is some democratic and liberal spirit thriving underneath the Reich. The reports back home to Washington that night were ample in praise for the regime in Germania. Truly, the Reich is a land of wise men, great artists, and certainly delicious meals."

The men dealt with here were the worst of the worst - men who flocked to the banners of the likes of Göring, Bormann and Heydrich for the chance to loot, rape and pillage. Hamburg had the fortune of maintaining a strong student militia, who were able to put them down before-"\n\nAmbassador Dowling had knelt down to pick something up. He stood and held it up to Schmidt's eyes. A high heeled shoe, stained a muddy red. For the first time in a long time Schmidt stumbled on his words - his mouth curled in an ugly expression before he sighed and flicked his cigarette into the canal.\n\n"There was much collateral damage. While the students may have been some of our Führer's most ardent supporters, they were... overzealous.\n\nDowling scowled and dropped the shoe. How many innocent people lay at the bottom of that canal?"

SPEERUSA.38.t:0 "Schmidt Explains Themselves"
SPEERUSA.38.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt wore a solemn expression as he narrated to the American delegation the story of the final days of the "Battle for Hamburg" which saw reformist militias face the feared "Verlorene Hoffnung" SS-Division, tasked by Reynard Heydrich to take the city at the beginning of the civil war, when everyone was scrambling to establish control over as much territory and industry as possible.\n\nThe division easily broke through the city outskirts, and started executing anyone suspected of being a Speerite, which meant almost everyone as Hamburg was well-known for harboring reform-aligned sentiments. Then, the militias launched a pincer manoeuver near the university, along the Grinderallee, forcing the enemy to retreat under heavy fire: while most managed to leave, a group of around two hundreds SS took refuge in the botanical garden, but in the end they all either died fighting, or committed suicide.\n\n"I beg you, try to imagine how this beautiful city was after the attack" the Reichsminister pleaded as his audience listened, "Ten thousand civilians had been murdered, the hospitals were full of wounded, the university had been turned into an emergency infirmary, and the obituaries were exploding with bodies so much that we had to store them in the market square: hundreds of innocents and loved ones piled like sandbags, waiting for their turn to be buried without a funeral!" Finally, he looked at the lined corpses with tear-filled eyes, and no one could truly understand whether they were the practiced trick of an expert diplomat, or if one of those "sandbags" after the battle had been someone he knew. "We couldn't bury them. There was no place in the cemeteries, not even for our own people. Sad as it may be, they were buried here not out of cruelty, but to avoid the spread of infection."\n\nAfter a minute of silence, the American ambassador hugged the Minister, expressing his sympathy for the population of this wounded land, and asked him if he was still able to continue the negotiations. Visibly relieved, Schmidt nodded, and they left this small piece of a horrible past behind."

Dowling is subtly suggesting the Reich as it is now would never be able to stand the test of time, and though Helmut agrees in his heart, he can't help but think his duty was to defend the Führer's work: Speer may be an asshole sometimes, and block his reforms with stale concepts such as "moderation" and "not risking another civil war" but openly criticizing him? He wouldn't be so undiplomatic do such a thing in front of a foreign delegation!\n\nAs he takes the wine in his hand, he knows he has to make a choice: counter Dowling's subtle accusations, or divert the course of the conversation?"

Luckily, Schmidt had foreseen that issue, and had twisted the arms of the Propaganda Ministry to ensure that only a selection of the Reich's many entertainment and artistic films were chosen for the Americans' viewing. Convincing Speer that impressing the Americans with enjoyable films was more pragmatic than angering them with propaganda was not very difficult.\n\nAnd indeed, the reactions Schmidt distinguished indicated that Das deutsche Filmfestival in Hollywood was at least a mild success. By far the most popular work shown was an ambitious remake of the hit 1942 drama Die große Liebe; its message was subtly shifted from one of commitment to war to being anti-war, but what really caused it to stand out was its new star: renowned comedy actor Heinz Rühmann, demonstrating his versatile acting abilities portraying Paul, the romantic lead.

But Schmidt did not care to attend the airshow, as he didn't wish to be reminded of his time at the Ministry of Aviation; after all, didn't he effectively have a hand in those terror bombings? No, he wouldn't think about it. The sooner Schmidt's diplomatic endeavours succeeded, the sooner Germany could be rid of Nazism, which was all that mattered now as far as he was concerned.\n\nFrom what Schmidt had heard from one of his envoys, the airshow had been another mild success, with the Luftwaffe squadron impressing the Americans with a variety of formations, maneuvers, and one particularly sharp turn that apparently caused a great number of gasps. Well, as long as all of these goodwill gestures were appreciated by the Americans, Schmidt had nothing to worry about.

The Führer's open blessing to this endeavor underlines once more how much sway does the Gang of Four hold over the German government...\n\nAt the committee's first meeting, after a first opening message by Albert Speer, in which he encourages its members to "amaze the world with the Reich's greatness", everyone starts working in earnest. As soon as the first folders are opened, already an important question arises, one which will influence all future works: what kind of event will the fair be?\n\nSome wish to create a reduced version of World Fair on the model of the great 1937 Paris fair, where the German pavilion towered over all others; members from the ministry of research propose a technological fair, where the greatest progresses of our scientists and inventors can be put on display for the world to look in envy; finally, more than a few voice their support for a very peculiar idea, which is a cultural fair: rather than showing industrial or technological progresses, how about showing the world that which makes our country unique?

Architects and artists from the Reich's most prestigious faculties and circles are called to design the pavillon, and the tycoons are already in line to have their work showcased.\n\nAs the first lines are drawn, however, a sore point immediately stands out: we are going to have an exposition in a country we fought, and defeated, a mere twenty years ago, and there are many who would strongly oppose all our government stands for; should we try to create a "neutral ground" for the fair, removing all symbols of our regime - especially the swastikas - or should we show the world what we truly are?\n\nOf course, the conservatives are outraged that such a thing is even being discussed: we are a National Socialist nation, and Hitler's guidance was what brought us from a defeated nation, to the world's greatest empire! Denying our legacy is a crime against those who lost their lives to make the Vaterland great!\n\nOn the contrary, reformist members, especially those aligned with Schmidt and Erhard, fear that the sight of a banner with the swastika might scare off American investors, and draw heavy criticism from the political establishment, compromising the fair's success: as such, they vocally ask to "tune down" on the symbols of what may be our political ideology, but risks hurting the feelings of our hosts.\n\nAs the discussion doesn't seem to end, the chairman sighs and calls for a vote on the issue: "those who are in favor of removing all political symbols, please raise their right hand!" and the result is..."

Delegates from the most prestigious universities, technical faculties and research institutes buth public and private flow in and out of the committee's offices, trying to get their work displayed. At the same time, the architects are already hard at work on the pavilion: it will be modern and functional with its straight lines and visible steel frame, but beautiful and full of light as the glass walls bathe everything in a complex game of lights and mirrors, giving the fair an out-of-the-world feeling.\n\nWhile everything goes smoothly, some of the committee members start to notice a worrying trend, as a large part of the exposition is being reserved for military inventions. As they point out to their colleagues, we are being hosted by a nation we fought with those exact weapons a mere twenty years ago: surely, their veteran associations and the conservative political establishment would strongly disapprove, or even boycott the fair!\n\nWhile some agree with this train of thought, others stand up, and reply that our new discoveries in the military field are extremely important, and will surely amaze the world! We won the world not thanks to poorly-armed conscripts, but with technological excellency and constant improvement!\n\nAs the discussion keeps going on, the committee head calls a vote to settle the matter once and for all: after the hands are counted, the fair will..."

The committee is already preparing the events which will take place in the various sections of the pavilion, from a small Oktoberfest directly from Bavaria, to traditional dances from Tyrol, Alsatian wines and Prussian cuisine: we shall show the world that we aren't what we were before, and that now there's space for happiness even in our war-torn country!\n\nA lighter atmosphere pervades the committee as reformists and conservatives can't find any truly divisive matters. The building itself fills with color as a variegated crowd enters the offices to vie for patronage: woodcarvers with their finest creations, patissiers bribing the members with an enticing offering of pastries and receipts passed from generation to generation, and even a choir in their traditional attire singing outside the office! The committee headquarters shine as it becomes, just for a few days, a melting pot of German culture.\n\nAs time passes, however, an issue arises. This time, however, the line of division isn't drawn between reformists and conservatives, but between "alcoholics" and "sanctimonious prudes" as they have started calling each other: as hundreds of beer distilleries have offered to sponsor the event, and many of them have asked to have their stands and stalls all throughout the exhibition, there is the question about whether to officially endorse the beer companies or keep the fair family-friendly.\n\nThe committee chairman calls for a vote on the matter, not before finishing his beer though..."

As the pavilions are dismounted, and everyone starts the long journey to their respective homelands, it's time to draw a final balance of the event: numbers are truthful, and the results have been... awesome!\n\nAlmost two hundred thousand people visited the German pavilion, and the various expositions inside were appreciated by everyone. The Amerikaner felt welcomed by the elaborately-decorated building, especially since, with the sole exception of the official flag of the Reich present here and there - the only point the Führer was adamant about - it was devoid of any national socialist symbol. The worries of the Gang of Four proved correct: without anything to criticize, the hawks within the American government were silenced, and everyone enjoyed the fair without any kind of polemic.\n\nWith the resounding success of the event spreading like a wildfire throughout the Vaterland, the reformists acquire even more power within the government, something which irks the Führer more than a bit. In the end, however, he knows this will benefit the Reich, and he'll be the one to ultimately reap the fruits of their efforts, so for the moment he has decided to keep his grumblings to himself, and influence the work of the Four with a lighter tough, as any true ruler knows how to do."

This moment was not to be taken lightly.\n\nSmall talk was made until the food arrived: the main entrée was a succulent, mouthwatering roasted goose, and Schmidt simply couldn't help himself. "I suppose you could say the goose is cooked?" (Schmidt's English was very good but he hadn't yet gotten a full grasp of this particular idiom). Surprisingly, it got a genuine chuckle from the president, perhaps because he simply appreciated Schmidt's attempt. But from then on, it was if the air had cleared, and friendly, amicable conversation proceeded as if the two had known each other forever.\n\nLater, on a very full stomach, Schmidt and the president went out before the sea of reporters and staffers to sign the document officially ending the embargo between the US and Germany. "If we can't kill each other, we might as well trade, no?" cracked Schmidt, getting plenty of laughs despite the unfortunate degree of truth buried in the joke."

SPEERUSA.59.desc:0 ""Indeed, this wine is truly good! Is it Alsatian?" A slight shadow passes over Walter's face, as he has been deprived of a nice political debate, but he understands why Schmidt chose to divert the conversation: he knows where Helmut's heart truly lies, everyone knows it, but rubbing the faults of the government he's part of in his face would be too much. So, he accepts another glass of wine from the server, and they discuss the pros and cons of Alsatian and Bavarian wines compared to the omnipresent Italian ones, especially now that the entirety of Northern France no longer produces anything worth of note.\n\nThe evening soon turns into night, as the two parties socialize more and more, passing from topic to topic with a spontaneity that is almost unbefitting of seasoned diplomats, but with enough wine, everyone becomes a good friend! As the last desserts are finished, and the waiters begin clearing out the table from the used cutlery, everyone gets up, and all shake their hands before the Americans return to their diplomatic quarters.\n\nA second before boarding the car, Walter Dowling looks seriously at Schmidt: "I know what you are trying to do for your country, Helmut" he begins, opting for once to let go of diplomatic platitudes: "The United States are still unsure about how to truly consider your Führer, whether a true reformer or simply an astute liar, but as long as you are part of his government, I am willing to believe that this country can truly find a way to prosperity after what it has suffered. Good luck with that" and then he is gone, leaving a surprised Schmidt behind."

In truth, that this would happen was already an open secret: ever since the first news of what the Reich would bring to the fair were leaked to the American people, a wave of unanimous protest arose from all political parties, from the moderates to the hawks, against what the newspapers called 'a show that hurts the eyes'\n\nThe days following the grand opening weren't that much eventful, and indeed some visitors from the Reich and other aligned nations were well-welcomed by the personnel, but most of the American public remained far away from the pavilion. When the fair closed, the balance was judged 'sorely negative' and the reformists, like the legendary Cassandra, could only look sadly at the numbers with an expression that said 'I told you'\n\nPerhaps, the conservatives should choose to fight worthier battles..."

As the American public visits our stands, they meet and talk with our people, and learn that we aren't swastika-bearing, Hitler-worshipping, slave-driving monsters like some propaganda depicted us trying to prevent us from being invited to the fair. The more the Americans accept us as we are now, the faster we can improve our standing and recover from the destruction wrought by the Bürgerkrieg."

Our exhibitions and shows have amazed the Amerikaner, and they have visited our stands in numbers we couldn't even imagine.\n\nAs the pavilion is dismounted, and everyone starts their long journey home, the Führer has expressed his congratulations to the "heroes of the Reich abroad" who managed to "show the entire world how much we have changed" after all the sufferings we endured. Our diplomatic standing with the United States has also considerably improved, and Reichsminister Erhard already predicts a surge in foreign trade with members of the OFN!"

SPEERUSA.67.desc:0 ""Adolf Hitler was, shall I say, not the most popular figure outside of the Greater Reich, mein Führer." \n "Your point being, Herr Schmidt?" asked Speer. \n "Well, mein Führer, I was thinking it might be a prudent move for our administration to... distance ourselves from him. It'd be wise to demonstrate that we are no longer seeking the brutal conquest which was, of course, a cornerstone of Führer Hitler's foreign policy, you see." \n An awkward pause lapsed as Speer considered Schmidt's borderline treasonous suggestion. He chewed on the idea for several moments before nodding to himself and saying, "I can see how doing so would be beneficial to our diplomatic efforts, and it might even improve my personal image abroad. But of course, there will be strong resistance from many people here in Germany, especially the social conservatives. I trust you will help our administration deal with any backlash?" \n"Oh, why of course... mein Führer," replied Schmidt, who seemed to assume a noticeably brighter demeanor."

The sound of angry protestors and even a few "Heil Hitlers" could be heard not far from the Reichstag, which certainly helped to illustrate Speer's skepticism. \n "...Yes. Distancing ourselves from him is absolutely necessary, mein Führer," replied a distant and distracted Schmidt. "I need to go for a walk." Schmidt gave a timid but respectful salute to Speer and quickly exited the building. \n As he walked down Adolf-Hitler-Straße and past the Adolf-Hitler-Platz, Schmidt noticed the many lingering signs of war: former soldiers aimlessly walking the street, some with broken or missing limbs and some begging for spare change; a fair deal of unemployed non-veterans, too; and there were even some buildings that had leftover damage from accidental shelling or bombing during the Bürgerkreig in which so many had sacrificed so much simply for that cunning bastard Speer to enact a slightly less brutal and genocidal version of his predecessor's ideology. \n Adolf Hitler was a man who brought so much unnecessary suffering and destruction to the world. How could the German masses revere him so? Schmidt figured he'd have to emphasize the world's fear and hatred of the man and avoid non-starters like his absurd racial beliefs and genocide. It was a ridiculous and unfair situation, but like always Schmidt would just carry on and make the best of it."

SPEERUSA.69.desc:0 "As usual, the forty soldiers of the SS garrison were parading in front of the border, only stopping at the exact line dividing the two territories, and Rudolf Niedersen, commander of the Bretten Grenzwacht, looked impotently, as his men were far fewer due to the low budget. Suddenly, a call interrupted his rancorous thoughts: he answered, listened, and not five minutes later his men too were in parade at the sides of the road. The commanding SS looked at the ten watchmen, slightly amused: "Is this everything the mighty Reich can summon against the Righteous?" he spat at his counterpart. Then, the earth began to tremble.\n\nBefore the SS could speak again, a Panzer appeared from behind a building, and moved at full speed towards the border. The black-uniformed soldiers remained still as the tank got closer, closer, CLOSER. When only a few meters separated the armored beast from the soft flesh, Rudolf smiled in glee: the men in black took one step backwards, then two, and then everyone was falling in disorder as the Grenzwacht laughed.\n\nWith a loud noise, the tank halted one meter over the border. The SS returned, indignation etched over his face: "You are trespassing on the Ordensstaat! I demand that-" he stopped when faced with the barrel of Rudolf's pistol. "You hold no authority here, Verräter" he spat, feeling cruel joy in the way the other's face contorted. "This land belongs to the Vaterland, and you are unlawfully occupying it. There are no borders within the Reich, and the traitor you call "master" will soon understand it!"\n\nAs he spoke, several trucks unloaded a hundred Heer soldiers, who immediately set up building fortifications. The watchman looked the SS dead in the eye, and his voice was cold as steel: "It's only a matter of time before we return to Paris. Enjoy your black uniform while you can, for one day you'll hang from a balcony, and I'll be the one to push you DOWN" and for the first time, Rudolf saw fear in the eyes of the SS."

The black-uniformed German took the letter and gave it a cursory read: he already knew its content, as it was identical to the speech given by the Führer just the day before, then he put it into his pocket and returned to his position, without any outward sign of either interest or worry. After all, it was nothing but the formal certification of the current state of affairs\n\n"Citizens of the Reich, today is a sad day for our country. As Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler has refused to cede command and face due trial for his actions during the war which tore our country asunder, he is immediately relieved of any office and is to be arrested on sight for treason and mass murder.

The two officers saluted in unison with a simultaneous, "Heil!"\n\nSpeer returned the gesture and stared at the map with a furrowed brow. "Let's hear your proposal, Generalfeldmarschall." He trusted the man little, and his military strategies less, but Speer knew better than to deny an audience with a man so influential in the militarist movement.\n\n"My proposal is simple," Schörner boasted, almost dismissively. He waved his hand generally across the land below him. "Warfare is fought in the mind as well as the battlefield. It's one thing to throw empty words at the Jews in the White House; it's quite another to strike true fear into their craven hearts." The hawk jabbed his finger close to the East Coast, and for a fleeting moment Speer thought he was about to argue for a declaration of war against the United States. "We should fly our strategic bombers straight towards internationally recognized American airspace, before turning away at the last moment! True fear will grip the Americans, and their leaders will be on paranoid alert, never knowing when a first strike is truly coming. I call it 'Schwarze Walküre'."\n\n"Herr Speer, this is far too risky!" Von Trescow shook his head in disbelief. Schörner glared at him with the shards of ice lurking behind his spectacles."What if our pilots fail to turn away in time? What if the Americans act prematurely?"\n\n"These mongrels slighted the Reich!" Schörner snapped, his spittle spraying across the map. "They're not stupid enough to retaliate, but it will teach them a lesson they won't forget."\n\nSpeer silently rubbed his chin in thought.

The teacher watched from the sideline, occasionally passing back a ball kicked out of bounds. Johann felt at ease here at school. Although scars maimed his face,, anyone who knew Johann could vouch for his giant heart. Johann was always calm, and tried his hardest to be fair and kind, to great success. Though they wouldn't admit it to his face, his students only sang praise about their teacher to his co-workers and their parents, to Johann's embarrassment. Still, it was welcome praise; the children gave him purpose. Although he had lost his pregnant wife in the civil war, being a mentor to the next generation of Germans gave Johann hope. Here he was, helping to raise a new generation, and he did so with much kindness. In a way, they were his family. He did however envy the children; not having to join a Nazi chapter to have friends or to particapate in the football clubs. They didn't have to know party politics to be able to swim at the local pool, nor they weren't judged by their devotion (or lack of) to Hitler's cult of personality. They could be children. It was a wonderful time to be young, and he was glad that he fought for that.\n\nThe sound of jets roaring overhead nearly made Johann flinch, his reflexes almost taking control over his body, even after all these years. He took a deep breath. He had to stay composed for the children.\n\nJohann looked above, watching yet another airwing soar above his head, heading northwest, likely following the last hundred or so plans that came before that week. Another batch of strategic bombers. Worrying.\n\nAs the children cheered and waved at the soaring planes above, the seed of worry in his head grew more. Why was there so much traffic in the air? Why were they all moving northwest? He pondered as the planes flew out of sight. A ball hit his leg.\n\n"Herr Steiner, can you pass the ball?" A little girl yelled from across the field.

The fucking Germans are ten minutes out! I need a goddamn answer, now!" Over the line, yelling and the sound of chaos rang in the background. "This is the President..." The line went silent. As if on cue, the background chatter died as if the call was on speaker. The Situation Room mirrored the silence. The President glaced around the room.

Eighteen of the twenty escorts, shot down. No pilots recovered, and no word from the Americans if they rescued any. I don't know what would be better; writing the letters to the families of brave men killed in defense of the Reich, or having to talk to the Americans about returning our men they captured. This is a disaster." The Führer sighed. "What the hell are we going to do?"\n\nSchörner pulled a folder that he had tucked away, and handed it to Speer. The Führer wordlessly opened the folder and read the proposal. A moment of silence passed.\n\n"Wow. The gall of you, Schörner." Schörner finally spoke. "This was an act of war. The militarists are up in arms and demand decisive action. There is no other..." "Are you fucking mad, man?" Speer snapped. Dropping his voice, "This would start a fucking war! Are you willing to give up everything for postering, for you and the military's ego?"\n\nSchörne glanced at his feet, then looked up. "If we don't respond... we look terribly weak on the foreign stage, and God knows what happens at home if we do NOTHING. That's why we chose Iceland. Small population, but important enough to show the world not to underestimate us. Ever.\n\nSpeer's head dropped. "My Führer, it's a hard choice, but with your word, we can strike back tonight.

The room cheered; all approaching bombers had been splashed. This was followed shortly by, "Enemy fighters engaging, returning fire." The room sat in silence as the dogfight commenced over a thousand miles from the White House. Smith's stomach sank as a young man screamed "I'm hit, I'm hit!" before breaking up. Another American pilot, although calm, reported the same. He at least managed to confirm "Bailing out." before losing radio contact. The American fighters were quick to respond, twelve American interceptors who had been observing near their operational height limit dove down unto the approaching German formation, quickly scattering them, decisively changing the balance of power.\n\nAfter only half an hour, the crisis was over. The Germans just couldn't regain the initiative, and after a dozen confirmed kills, the rest of the formation scattered back to Germany. Both American fighters who had been shot down were promptly recovered, along with several Germans. The mood back in the White House wasn't enthusiastic, however. Although the U.S Airforce had won decisively, the men in the Situation Room were already plotting and planning for Germany's response. Would they take such a defeat sitting down?"

"Surely democracy is better than all other forms of government!" is his immediate reply, "Men were born to be free, Helmut, and democracy is the only way such natural instinct can be satisfied: under a tyranny, there will always be resistance, and its eventual collapse is a matter of time"\n\nSchmidt understands that by talking in absolutes, this would lead nowhere, so he smiles courteously to his guest, and answers: "And yet the Reich is the result of democracy's failure, Walter. The democratic government of Weimar wasn't able to answer to the demands of the German people, and so it was replaced by a government which could meet such demands of order and rebirth. The results of this are well-known, and I believe I don't need to reminisce the events of the past two decades with you, my friend" he says, putting a bit of accent on the word "friend"\n\nDowling understands that going down this road may as well lead to the visit's failure, and also he has been taken aback by the German's point of view, so he decides to end the debate and directs an equally courteous smile towards Schmidt: "Indeed, our world is far more complex than what we would want to, isn't it?

To the bold, to the Reich, and to their fearless leader, who had redeemed their honor and avenged their recent dead; those pilots who did not return from their sortie to Iceland.

Speer knew that the missiles would strike with their deadly payloads within fifteen minutes. It was hardly any time for the citizens to reach the few bunkers scattered across Germany. Ten minutes after the alarms sounded, intermittent shaking began. Speer felt little terror within himself, but pangs of remorse racked his mind.

Neither man spoke as they watched the horizon glow, the grand beacons of light and ash approaching closer and closer to Germania.\n\n"So, this is it." The general finally broke their silence.

As he continued to stroll down the familiar corridor, four younger men; all secretaries or scrubs scurried out of Speer's office. Schörner took a deep breath, and paused outside of the door. A loud bang closely followed by the sound of breaking glass came from the other side of the door. A curse, then silence. Schörner knocked.\n\nWhat the hell do you idiots want?!" Speer screamed. He was pissed. Schörner took another breath, then strolled in confidently.\n\nThe office was a mess. It was clear that Albert Speer was in a rage; something Schörner had never seen from the usually calm and collected man. Files and papers were strewn everywhere. A full sized mirror in the corner of the room was shattered into a million pieces, specks of blood strewn nearby. Pacing back and forth behind his desk was a disheveled Albert Speer, blood trickling down from his cut knuckles. He looked up and paused; his facing darkening when he realized just who had entered.\n\n"You." Speer spoke, then paused. Schörner, for once, had nothing to say. "Make your report, and make it quick."\n\n"My Führer," he began. For once, he spoke those words without any trace of comptemet. For once, the two were in complete agreement with what had to be done. There was no backing down now. "The U-Boats are off the coast of Iceland, as ordered. They are standing by on your..."\n\nSpeer cut him off. "Did I not give you simple, easy, God damn instructions?" His tone was quieter now, but menacing. It was as if venom came from his lips.\n\n"Ah, uh, yes, sir." Schörner replied without stumbling over too many of his words. Describing Speer as 'frustrated' was definitely an understatement.\n\n"The caption refused the codes from me. Said procedure required him to hear the orders from your mouth." Speer merely stared at the general. Schörner, for his part, remained calm. He walked forwards with his typical confidence and handed Speer a note with a number on it. "The direct line, sir." Speer immediately punched the numbers into his land line.\n\n"Captain Von Steiner, reporting." The voice on the other end spoke calmly, as if rehearsed a thousand times."

The planes launched from Germany, came within a thousand meters of their airspace, then abruptly turned back, with no complications. In fact, there were even no mechanical issues. Everything went perfectly, in every sense of the word. "What is the response from the Americans?"\n\n"Officially, none, my Führer. Unofficially?

Maybe to show strength. But from men like Charles Lindburg, these incursions were a pain in the ass. Because every week, the Germans did the same thing; five strategic bombers with twenty or so escorts flew towards an OFN base or airspace, and every time they did this, NORAD had to respond as if the Germans were about to strike. Planes had to be mobilized on next to no notice, bases had to be mobilized, and the Armed Forces freaked out. Every. God. Damn. Time.\n\nLindburg was sick of it. His colleges were sick of it. The Navy man on the phone was pissed off and sick of it. But, everyone understood that, knowing the Germans, the one time NORAD doesn't react to a threat seriously would be the one time the Germans struck an OFN base. Life is fickle like that.\n\nThe man in the phone continued to yell. "Twenty five! Twenty five bogies heading towards MY airspace! I want thirty, no, fifty interceptors circling above my HQ in ten minutes!" A loud BANG emitted from the phone. Lindburg winced and rubbed his ear as he put the cold plastic back on its base. What a prick. Lindburg didn't even rise from his desk; they were already scrambling nearly two dozen interceptors; no other fighters were close enough to respond within twenty minutes. Not that it would matter, because in ten, the Germans would abruptly break off their course and head home. God damn bastards. The man rubbed his temple, a thudding headache was starting to kill him.

If he deemed it necessary, then it must be, and he would carry out his duty.\n\nWorry embedded itself into the man's heart long after the planes streamed north-west.

A missle streamed past the plane, then another one. Yes! They may make it out of this yet. Their turn was almost complete, then they could...\n\nBefore he could finish his thought, the entire plane rocked and the alarms started screaming. "Shit!" the co-pilot yelled. "Engines one through three are down!" The pilot looked out the cockpit to the damaged wing, and his stomach dropped. There wasn't a wing there.\n\nThe plane started nosediving and spinning, while above him an intense dogfight broke out.

Dejectly, he flipped a switch. Instantly, G-force pushed him back into his seat as the air-brakes engaged. In three seconds, he was back in formation. Patience.

The air-to-air missiles streamed past, leaving nothing but a red glare in their wake. He watched. Would he be so....\n\n"Yes!" he shouted as his, and his missile alone smashed into a bomber in the rear. Confirmed kill. Hell yeah. The triumph was short-lived. Over a dozen German fighters dove from above as the five escorts close to the bombers scattered, but not before launching their own barrage of missiles. Fuck. Fuck. FUCK. A missle streamed right towards his plane. Shit. He slammed the joystick up in an attempt to evade. His reaction was quick, and almost perfect. In fact, if the green rookie hadn't been so fast, the missile would have flown straight into his cockpit; he would have been incinerated instantly. Instead, the midsection of the plane took the brunt of the damage. The jet started to spin helplessly out of control, rolling on all axes. "THIS IS 2-9! I'M HIT, I'M HIT! I'M GOING DOWN!" He looked at his consul in panic. No power. Had anyone heard him?\n\nThe plane was in a hopeless tailspin, next to no control, losing altitude fast. Way too fast. The plane wouldn't stop rolling for a safe ejection. He would have to time this perfectly. He prayed as he grabbed the ejection lever. Would it work? Would he time the erratic movements of the plane just right? The plane spun right side up. He pulled the lever. Nothing.\n\nThe plane tilted about ninety degrees before the canopy popped off and the seat ejected. A sideways ejection. SHIT. The man almost cried as he looked down at the fast approaching water. Is this how he died, on his first mission? No...no. Not like this. The pilot threw all of his body weight back, and miraculously, the chair leveled right side up.

While the Gang of Four is pleased by this development, as they know it will greatly help the fair's success, their opponents in the government accuse them openly of "betraying Hitler's legacy" and "selling our country for a few dollars" with several high-ranking party officials and bureaucrats signing an official request to the Führer to step in and "stop this madness"\n\nAs letter of protest pile on his desk at the Reichskanzlei, Albert Speer can't help but understand the plight of the protesters. The Gang of Four clearly stands for something different that what he believes in, for something different from national socialism, and this fact sometimes infuriates him: if he could solve all of Germany's problem by removing those four bastards, he would have done that ages ago! Sadly, it isn't so simple: each of them is the best of the best in what they do, and even he has to admit they all love the Vaterland in their own, flawed way, and want to see it reborn, if under a different form.\n\nSighing, he takes another letter and reads it. He would like to simply throw them into the dustbin, but doing so would only enrage his own party even more. As he takes up the pen to answer the missive, he writes the same words for the umpteenth time: "Sehr geehrter Sekretär, though I understand your displeasure, and to some extent I even share it, the greatness of the Vaterland requires small sacrifices such as these to ensure we retake our legitimate place among the world powers. I will make sure that the honour of the Reich is upheld even in distant Amerika, and that no one dares to think the everlasting sun of National Socialism is setting on our empire! Yours truly, the Führer."
SPEERUSA.119.a:0 "Another one done, now on to the next... mein Gott, they are so many!"

SPEERUSA.103.t:0 "We Are Not Ashamed"
SPEERUSA.103.desc:0 "With the decision taken, the committee now resumes work, and the cadre of architects, sculptors and various artists tasked with designing the German pavilion can truly show how much they love their country! Paul von Esleben, a well-known architect and war veteran, has submitted the preliminary project for the pavilion, which was so well-liked by the Führer that he ordered for it to be immediately displayed on all official media as "the finest example of the Neue Moderne Nationalsozialistische Architektur" which, coming from Hitler's personal architect, goes much further than a mere political praise.\n\nThe building itself is a tall, cylindrical structure of steel and glass, representing the new Reich, tall and powerful, and yet transparent and modern, with four spyrals regularly intertwining symbolizing the conflict between the various souls of national socialism. At each junction, an eagle's head juts out, holding a flag with the Swastika to remember the battles fought between the contenders of the Bürgerkrieg.\n\nOf the four spirals, three interrupt roughly five meters before the top, where the last one turns from the usual color of steel to pure gold, just as Führer Speer managed to prevail over the flawed ideologies of his rivals and show how National Socialism was meant to be. Finally, the spiral reaches the top, where it flattens into a platform sustaining a golden swastika upon which stands perched Fritz Koenig's masterpiece, a massive eagle with its wings spread looking over Boston as a predator looks upon its prey.\n\nAs the entire Reich rejoices for such a display of national pride, we are sure to march towards a resounding success in Boston!"
SPEERUSA.103.a:0 "In art as well as on the field of battle, we show our might and our superiority."

SPEERUSA.104.t:0 "The German Future"
SPEERUSA.104.desc:0 "With the focus of the fair finally chosen, the committee can finally start working. Contacts are made with all possible companies, no matter the object of their research, and the most impressive or promising ones are immediately packed and sent to Boston. Electronics and mechanics, civilian and military, the German future will be put on display for the world to drown in their own envy!\n\nNew computers from Siemens will prove their superior calculation speed, cars and trucks from Volkswagen will be an example of futuristic lines and powerful engines, and the latest tanks and fighter planes from Porsche and Heinkel will show the Amerikaner why choosing war over diplomacy would be a very poor choice!\n\nOf course, the more awe-inspiring prototypes have been 'leaked' to the German public, rousing patriotic support for the exhibition: we must capitalize on our renewed grandeur as much as possible, after all..."
SPEERUSA.104.a:0 "It will be a success, I'm sure of it!"

SPEERUSA.105.t:0 "A Show of Commercial Science"
SPEERUSA.105.desc:0 "Despite the complaints from our military firms, and the conservative officials supported by them, in the end the committee has chosen to concentrate on civilian and commercial technological advancements. We can't risk scaring our potential customers, not so soon after having managed to finally secure a trade treaty with the United States!\n\nAlready our largest companies are stepping forward to propose their latest designs, and several smaller research institutes and academies will have their own stands to show off advanced prototypes. With our industrial and commercial might in full display, we'll prove to the world that we don't need weapons to be among the greatest powers on Earth!"
SPEERUSA.105.a:0 "We pave the way to the future!"

SPEERUSA.106.t:0 "Lots of German Beer"
SPEERUSA.106.desc:0 "In the end, the committee has chosen not to ban breweries from entering the fair, on the ground that beer is one of the oldest and proudest traditions of our already great country. The fact that the most ardent supporters of this thesis can often be seen toasting to anything coming to their mind in the most esteemed Brauhaus Georgbræu, surely has nothing to do with their opinion on the matter...\n\nAlready dozens of breweries, both ancient and new, are flooding - literally - the committee with their precious merchandise, hoping to get a stand in the fair building, and a "sampling under-committee" hurriedly forms to discern whether they are actually good beers or dirty water. As predicted, the volunteers are simply too many, and no one wants to cede their place, which prompts the chairman to select the members by extraction: of course, he "needs to be part of it" in order to "keep everything under control"
SPEERUSA.106.a:0 "A toast to the Reich! Another! Aaand... anoscher...hic!"

SPEERUSA.107.t:0 "A Family Fair"
SPEERUSA.107.desc:0 "Finally, the committee has decided to avoid conflicts with Amerikaner parent associations, and prevent any large concentration of alcoholic beverages at the fair. Even though beer is an important part of our Germanic heritage and culture, we can't let such an opportunity go to waste due to angry mothers complaining because their children want to taste that bubbling drink papa drinks himself to a stupor with every god-forsaken night.\n\nWe still have so much to show off! Toymakers and patissiers will give the children the kind of temptation no parent would ever deny, and we'll transfer an entire village from Tyrol, with the people clad in traditional garbs, with their own cuisine, even sheeps and cows: the families will absolutely love it!"
SPEERUSA.107.a:0 "Come to uncle Speer, little boy: many gifts await you at the fair.."

WORLD.2030.t:0 "Schwarze Walküre"
WORLD.2030.desc:0 "With the recent breakdown in diplomacy between America and Germany, Albert Speer, the Führer, has begun to mobilize the Luftwaffe. Anonymous sources within his bureaucracy state that Germany has approved a new operation. Codenamed "Schwarze Walküre", or "Black Valkyrie," this operation appears to be a German attempt to probe American and OFN airspace with massed air wings, including nuclear capable strategic bombers. German intentions are not clear at this time, but this appears to be a direct result of collapsed diplomatic overtures between the United States and German Reich. Foreign observers warn that already high tensions may raise even more, and caution that limited conflict could result.\n\nIt is unknown what the end results will be, but the world holds its breath as America and Germany square off."
WORLD.2030.a:0 "Who will blink first?"

 SPEERUSA.109.t:0 "The City of Angels"
 SPEERUSA.109.desc:0 "Helmut Schmidt, the new foreign minister of Germany, has decided to embark on a goodwill tour of the United States in hopes of restoring diplomatic and trade relations between our two countries. One of the first destinations on his trip is Los Angeles, California. Upon his arrival, he seemed to be somewhat bothered by something, especially when passing by the military checkpoints barring entrance to the Japanese-controlled port area. Mr. Schmidt did seem mildly interested in the various landmarks he saw such as the Griffith Observatory and Venice Canals, but at the end of the day did appear to be somewhat disappointed. Whether Schmidt's reaction was our fault or not is difficult to say, but surely he will enjoy the many other destinations he is scheduled to visit over the coming weeks."
 SPEERUSA.109.a:0 "He still has much more to see."

 SPEERUSA.110.t:0 "The City that Never Sleeps"
 SPEERUSA.110.desc:0 "Germany's new foreign minister, Helmut Schmidt, has arrived in New York City today as a major stop on his goodwill tour of the US. Luckily, in NYC, it isn't very difficult to show a man a good time, and he was taken to all of the classic destinations across the city; Central Park, Times Square, the Empire State, the Statue of Liberty, you name it. Schmidt was particularly excited and enthralled by the unique and "rough around the edges" character of New York, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy his day here. Hopefully the rest of his tour will be as thrilling as the Big Apple, but they call it The City that Never Sleeps for a reason!"
 SPEERUSA.110.a:0 "Come back soon!"

SPEERUSA.111.t:0 "The Unity Fair"
SPEERUSA.111.desc:0 "One of several events arranged by the Germans in the US as a goodwill gesture, the Unity Fair in Boston has been an unexpected success. Akin to the World Fairs that seem to happen few and far between these days, the Unity Fair has contained impressive displays of German architecture, science, technology, and culture in a manner that may have come off as slightly boastful or intimidating to some of the fair's attendees. But nagging in the minds of all who attended was the fact that restoring ordinary relations with the Germans could grant the United States unmitigated priority access to all of this incredible economic and human capital.\n\nAnd so, our people's reception to the Unity Fair was actually quite positive, with many of our citizens being rather impressed by what the Reich's best had to offer. Boston's mayor gave a brief speech thanking Germany for creating such a fun and exciting event, and at that point it seemed as if the Germans' ambitious diplomatic mission was not so out of reach as initially thought."
SPEERUSA.111.a:0 "Feel free to do this again sometime." 

SPEERUSA.112.t:0 "The Lincoln Memorial"
SPEERUSA.112.desc:0 "The final stop of his goodwill tour, German Foreign Minister Schmidt has arrived in Washington, D.C. From what we have heard from staffers present with the German delegation, the uncontested highlight of the visit for Mr. Schmidt was his stop at the (admittedly very lovely) Lincoln Memorial.\n\nDespite the supposedly much more impressive works and exhibits of Germania, Schmidt was apparently mesmerized by the statue and stood silently in its presence for several minutes. According to one staffer who was known to embellish his stories, a single teardrop could even be seen in Mr. Schmidt's eye. Either way, he seemed to very much appreciate the memorial and the great American values it stands for."
SPEERUSA.112.a:0 "The Nazi foreign minister admires Lincoln? Probably a good sign."

SPEERUSA.113.t:0 "Schmidt Sees the East Coast"
SPEERUSA.113.desc:0 "Foreign Minister Schmidt and his diplomatic entourage have arrived on the East Coast and have begun a sweeping tour across many of our coastal states. From hunting in the vast woods of northern Maine, to visiting the native-created Etowah Mounds in Georgia, to touring towns, factories, and other landmarks all over the Eastern Seaboard, the Germans have hopefully garnered a much better understanding of American culture and livelihood. We have at the very least given the foreign minister a highly interesting trip, and hopefully the hospitality we've shown to the representatives of our ostensible enemies will bear fruit in the form of improved relations."
SPEERUSA.113.a:0 "Where will he visit next?"

 SPEERUSA.114.t:0 "Fear and Loathing in Reno"
 SPEERUSA.114.desc:0 "Another event arranged (but not attended) by German Foreign Minister Schmidt, a German guest appearance at the Reno Air Show has (literally) turned some heads. While anyone even a year ago would have laughed at the idea of the Luftwaffe performing along with the US Air Force, attendees at the show had to admit that the German squadron was very impressive. Their maneuvers were executed flawlessly, and one hairpin turn even managed to elicit a few gasps and a small applause. It's safe to say that US-German diplomacy now has one more success under its belt."
 SPEERUSA.114.a:0 "See you again next show!"

 SPEERUSA.115.t:0 "Once upon a Time in Hollywood"
 SPEERUSA.115.desc:0 "In a gesture of goodwill, German Foreign Minister Helmut Schmidt has arranged a film festival in Hollywood to demonstrate the prowess of Germany's film industry, and to send a message that we and the Germans are not so different after all or some airy-fairy thing like that. But, we have to admit that we were pleasantly surprised and entertained by a number of quality films. Not all of them were too memorable, but one drama in particular starring a renowned comedy actor named Heinz Rühmann seemed to strike a chord with its audience.\n\nPerhaps, if relations do continue to improve, there could be a strong collaboration between our film industries, which could ultimately even lead to a strengthening of cultural ties between the US and Germany. Maybe that's getting a little ahead of ourselves, but nevertheless we can consider this evening to be a modest success."
 SPEERUSA.115.a:0 "We might be mortal enemies but who doesn't like a good movie?"

 SPEERUSA.116.t:0 "The Unity Fair Fails"
 SPEERUSA.116.desc:0 "One of several events arranged by the Germans in the US as a goodwill gesture, the Unity Fair in Boston has turned out rather unfortunately. Intended to be a grand exposition akin to the World's Fairs of decades past, the fair has instead reinforced the many negative cultural stereotypes our populace holds about Germany and its people. The site was covered head to toe in swastika-themed paraphernalia, which was a huge mistake considering that Americans do not react positively to the symbol they've learned to hate after years of German conquest and American propaganda.\n\nWhile the actual quality of the cultural and scientific displays was very impressive, the fair simply seemed to portray the Germans as humourless fanatics, which doesn't bode too well for our attempts to improve their image in the minds of the American people. Luckily, there are many more events and visits to come where this error can be rectified."
 SPEERUSA.116.a:0 ""Disunity Fair" would be a more fitting name."

 SPEERUSA.118.t:0 "Invitation to Hamburg"
 SPEERUSA.118.desc:0 "In the White House, items of interest easily disappear amongst the sea of constant busyness. Not today, however. In the Office of the United States Secretary of State, a letter from Berlin has arrived. An invitation.\n\nAmerica is a nation skeptical of the outside, and of no nation are the Yanks more suspicious than the Reich. However, an olive branch is a welcome gift in these parts, and, in a changing world, the more friends Washington has, the better. The letter was well addressed and complimentary, and the trip does sound delightful. Seeing the sights of Hamburg, a true European city of tradition and grace? Surely it couldn't be too bad.\n\n"
 SPEERUSA.118.a:0 "Pack the suitcases!"

 SPEERUSA.125.t:0 "Relocate the Protestors"
 SPEERUSA.125.desc:0 "God seems to have a special disdain for Hamburg. In 1842, the Great Fire broke out, destroying a third of the Altstadt's buildings. One hundred years later, she saw vicious bombing campaigns by the cursed British and allied forces. Just recently, 1962's North Sea Flood tested the wills of Hamburg's great citizens. Now, a rebellious plague sweeps the city, and its carrier is the fiery naivety of German youth.\n\nWe know not what the protestors demand, nor do we particularly care. All we know is that with the American's arriving in Germany, we cannot have these demonstrators crowding our streets, throwing bricks and generally making a mess of things.\n\nThankfully, a Chancellery meeting today has proved fruitful. Speer and Gehlen have sent armoured trucks and men with guns into Hamburg, quickly and effectively taking care of the rioters and moving them elsewhere. At least for now, our faces are saved."
 SPEERUSA.125.a:0 "Blitzkrieg."
