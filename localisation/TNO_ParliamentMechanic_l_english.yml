  ## Description
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_Speaker_Desc_ex: "Description, blah blah blah"
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_Speaker_Desc_Alec_Douglas_Home: "Alec Douglas-Home holds the dubious honour of being the only Prime Minister in over twenty years to be capable of holding office for more than three. Solidifying the Royal Party from a morass of cliques and power blocks into a at least nominally more united party by making deals with the major factions, Home has surprised his critics by seemingly being the first PM to seriously address the matter of armed rebellious groups without direct Cornish intervention. Perhaps Douglas-Home will be the Prime Minister England needs, but even if he isn't he's all England has."
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_Speaker_Desc_Reg_Birch: "The thoroughness with which the London Uprising was quashed cannot be understated, of the Communist leaders directly involved only a mere four dozen or so escaped, and less than half of the actual fighters were alive three weeks later. But Reg Birch did as he always does, he persevered and refused to give up. Rebuilding the communist networks into a less overt fighting force, Birch was one of the architects of the eventual Left Resistance and its union with HMMLR. Now that the fascists are gone, the former engineer is the face of English communism, God help those who stand in his way."
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_Speaker_Desc_Bernard_Montgomery: "When Britain splintered under the iron boots of the Wehrmacht, Bernard Montgomery did his duty by serving the collaborationists and keeping the nation together, protecting it from the extremes of Germany's wrath. Once more he has answered the call of duty in the name of England. With a stiff upper lip and a firm hand, Field Marshal Montgomery has established himself as ruler of the Southern Temporary Military District. When his work is done, only then will England return to normality."

  ## Description (Tooltip Delayed)
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_Monarch_Desc_ex: "Description, blah blah blah"
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_Monarch_Desc_Edward_VIII: "His Majesty, Edward VIII, the twice-crowned King of England, is hated by many from Bill Alexander to the English Church. Born during the reign of Queen Victoria II, Edward was directly in line for the British throne. He was crowned first in 1936 and reigned for an uneventful 3 years before crisis struck: Edward VIII was marrying an American divorcee and in order to do that, he was forced to give up his position as king. This was not to last. \n\nWhen the Germans landed on the shores of England, they crowned Edward as their puppet, and once again, Edward was reluctantly King of England. His second reign however was far more disastrous than the first and far less short with HMMLR growing in strength every day and the country in economic crisis as he watched. In truth, Edward would want nothing more than to abdicate his throne, but now, it falls to him to guide his nation through this time of turmoil."

  ## Description (Tooltip Delayed)
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_OppLeader_Desc_ex: "Description, blah blah blah"
   TNO_ParliamentMechanic_Ideas_OppLeader_Desc_Harold_Macmillan: "Sacrifice is the most noble of attributes a politician can have, perhaps that is why it's so astonishingly rare? Regardless, Harold Macmillan is defined by the fact that he will do absolutely anything and everything to keep England from another destructive war. Whether it be Germany or the United States, England in Macmillan's eyes is just not ready to suffer the loss of yet another generation of young men to the battlefields. Whether Macmillan is able to enact these desires is yet to be ascertained, but may God have mercy on those who stand against him."
