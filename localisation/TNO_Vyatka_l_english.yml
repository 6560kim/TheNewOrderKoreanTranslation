 ### Leader Descriptions ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_VLADIMIR_DESC:0 "Born into exile in 1917, Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov became head of the exiled Imperial Family of Russia in 1938 following the death of his father Kirill Vladimirovich, cousin of the late Emperor Nicholas II. Vladimir was residing in Brittany when the Second World War broke out, and he and his family quickly found themselves under German custody. After some... light coercion, he declared "eternal friendship and cooperation" with the Germans, and made frequent radio broadcasts urging all "faithful and loyal sons of the Homeland" to take up arms against the Soviets. The Nazis even offered him a role as regent of what would later become Reichskommissariat Ukraine, but he rejected it on the grounds that it would divide Russia.\n\nThe war came to an end, but Vladimir could not yet go home - the Germans were afraid that, much like with Vlasov, he may prove too popular and end up undermining their rule. It was not until the West Russian War a decade later that he convinced his handlers to let him go. Rallying a division of collaborators, monarchists, and exiled White officers, he helped lead the German counter-offensive. But as the Wehrmacht lost momentum, the Grand Duke pressed on, breaking through the Red lines and establishing a pocket of monarchist rule in Russia for the first time since 1918. The newly-minted Emperor Vladimir III had little luck extending his rule much farther, especially considering how the Germans discarded him as an asset the moment they believed the Red menace was shattered. Now the Tsar waits, biding his time for a moment of weakness in both his old enemies and his friends-turned-foes, before he dares to strike and reclaim his birthright."

 POLITICS_BORIS_SKOSSYREFF_DESC:0 "The story of West Russia's last monarch, Boris I, is a bizarre, yet fascinating one. Boris Mikhailovich Skosyrev was born to a rich family in Vilna, then part of the Russian Empire. While he was a member of a family that belonged to the gentry, he was never a claimant to any throne by birth - but what he couldn't get through his bloodline, he would earn on his own.\n\nWhen the October Revolution broke out, Boris fled and became one of the many emigrés. He would soon distinguish himself in the British Foreign Office, partaking in many missions before arriving in the Netherlands and then finding where his most famous adventure so far would unfold: the country of Andorra. After carefully plotting, he took the title of Prince with popular support in the 1930s, and promised to bring Andorra into the modern age. He would soon be arrested and imprisoned, but luckily, after spending a few years in prisons around Western Europe, he would be released by the Nazi occupation authorities and begin to collaborate with them. With the advent of the West Russian War and Tsar Vladimir's expedition, he gladly joined him, and stood by him as a loyal liaison - until it became inconvenient to do so.\n\nSkossyrev would not stay idle as the Anti-Communist Guard achieved victory after victory. One day, as the troops came closer to Vyatka, he would come to the city center, guns blazing, and declare the former West Russian authority to have ended, replaced by Kirpichnikov's army. In the place of the city's corrupt rulers, Boris I now rules as Prince of Vyatka and guardian of the frontier, in the name of the Anti-Communist Guard and the Russian people. For how long this principality will last, who knows."

 KIR_unrepentant_reaction_desc:0 "For years, the people of Russia have suffered under the cruel burden of Socialism, crushed beneath the weight of tyrant after tyrant, and through it all, they were tricked into believing their cruel masters had their best interests at heart. The Emperor has seen this, and he has decreed No More. Communism has brought the once-glorious Empire to its knees, but we will rise again to destroy it once and for all."
 KIR_officer_infighting:0 "Officer Infighting"
 KIR_officer_infighting_desc:0 "The White Army - and its remnants - has never exactly been a unified front. While it is true that they all share hatred for the Bolsheviks that stole Russia from them, the question of how exactly the reborn Empire should be governed is a divisive one that threatens to shatter the unity of our armies; while some petition for a democracy, others favor autocracy, and some small cliques talk of replicating the regimes of Germany and Italy.\n\nThe Emperor alone keeps them in line, and even then the army's performance suffers as commanders disobey orders, engage in petty schemes, and plot against one another. It is clear that if we are ever to rebuild what was once lost, our army must stand united."

Of late, however, more democratic, liberal ideas have begun to take hold in the hearts of his people. While his closest advisors bid him to do whatever he desires, the Emperor knows that he stands on a knife's edge between the love of his people and the same frustrations that nearly doomed the Empire. He must thus make his choice: To rule as his ancestors did, alone and absolute, or to give the people their own say in government?"

 KIR_return_of_the_tsar:0 "Return of the Emperor"
 KIR_return_of_the_tsar_desc:0 "During the West Russian War, in the heydays when the Revolutionary Front could bring Germany to its knees, something unthinkable happened. From all the chaos and din was born Vyatka, a radical throwback to the times before the Bolsheviks. A monarchist state in a Russia that had lost its faith with kings and emperors. However, its existence might not be so paradoxical after all. The reds have failed Russia, and now its people yearn for an alternative, a reaction, and hope, to hearken back to a time when the Germans feared them.\n\nHowever, we must pay attention to our immediate surroundings. The Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich Romanov has yet to be crowned Emperor. He bides his time, sharing the pain and suffering with the people of Vyatka, as gilded crowns and titles only offer cold comfort to them. Now, as the skies quieted, he has judged it an apt time to declare himself Emperor and set in motion the rebirth and reconstitution of Russia, with him at its head. The two-headed eagle shall soar again, free and untainted from the failures of the past."

 KIR_an_economic_graveyard:0 "An Economic Graveyard"
 KIR_an_economic_graveyard_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the war, the then-Grand Duke was startled awake by the screaming of bombers. The treacherous Germans have decided that the only means of keeping Russia on its knees was to maintain a terror bombing effort across its lands. In the meantime, what economy Russia had that was above village-scale collapsed, as the people quit the roads and trade stopped. Factories were either abandoned or bombed. Now we lack even the essential means to fund basic, rudimentary civil service and military.\n\nWhile the bombings still continue, we can still take stock of our economy. The government has one task: to evaluate our capabilities and natural resources and to look for directions to go. If we are to reunify Russia, we need a strong springing-board from which we launch our noble crusade. For Vyatka to serve that purpose, we must rebuild it, and raise its people from ashes up to their knees. Then, and only then, the other peoples of Russia shall look at it in envy, for our wise emperor rules over it."

 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery:0 "The Vyatka Distillery"
 KIR_the_vyatka_distillery_desc:0 "During the war and the bombing proceeding it, vodka had become scarce as alcohol producers abandoned their distilleries and potato farmers retreated into subsistence farming to better adapt to the harsh realities of life in a chaotic Russia. Still, vodka is the Russian water of life, and many people, not just Russians, would pay good money for a swig or shot of it. Its rarity and value meant that, in some parts of the country, the good old liquor was good old money.\n\nWith this in mind, the Emperor has proposed to the government two things. The first is to plant and farm potatoes, providing the people with a food source and jobs, as well as the ingredients for vodka. The second is to rebuild and reclaim distilleries for vodka to eventually flow out in a steady stream. Doing both of these things, the Emperor reasoned, will let us create a new source of income by targeting a market oft-ignored by our adversaries. The Russians are a hard-drinking people, after all, and all our adversaries will want it. Through trade, we will ensure a stable income, giving us more room and money for other projects, so that we can one day rule over this land again."

 KIR_alternative_uses:0 "Alternative Uses"
 KIR_alternative_uses_desc:0 "With a burgeoning alcohol industry built up, we can now turn toward making another use for the byproducts of the distillation process. Though it is hard to believe, alcohol has other functions besides making people drunk. In its purer, non-consumptive forms, it is usable as a disinfectant, antiseptic, or antidote. Within Russia, where violence abounds daily, its value is evident.\n\nAt the cost of alcohol productivity; we can construct new laboratories adjacent to our newly-minted distilleries. Our workers can then use these to make pure alcohol for medical purposes. We can use the results to treat the wounds our soldiers incur in the field of battle, and reduce the rate of infection and dirty-wound deaths.\n\nUsing trade, we can sell these to the other Russians. The profit influx can fund our armed forces and our efforts to reindustrialize Vyatka. And maybe, just maybe, warfare in Russia can be more civilized for once.

The government now has more to work with, and there is employment to be found in making vodka. The economy is growing, or at least has stopped contracting into itself.\n\nThere is a single problem standing in the way of sustaining this growth, however. As our markets expand, the distilleries have realized that despite the order to grow potatoes for vodka, we still have a shortage of them to ferment. The solution to this is the Imperial Potato Act. In it, the government stipulates aid, both in land and labor for farmers that agree to grow potato predominantly. Hopefully, this will incentivize our farmers to grow the crop and ensure a steady supply for our distilleries.\n\nThis done, the government, along with the Emperor, will look into foreign markets to sell the Vyatka-brand vodka. It won't be long until the Bretons, French, and the Germans will down the liquor of Russians, toasting to the Emperor's name."

The Emperor and the government are looking abroad to solve this, as solutions to Russia's problems do not necessarily lay in Russia.\n\nIn the years following the West Russian War and the OFN embargo, the black markets of Brittany have grown and then swollen as luxury goods such as alcohol and films became scarce. The government, with imperial assent, suggests that the time has come to reach into this foreign business. Although it probably won't sell as well as in Russia, the thirst of Europeans for a new kind of drink should entice them to at least try it, whatever their racial theories are."

By using river currents, commerce can flow faster on it than on land. Thankfully, in Vyatka itself, there is a river that will lend itself to this purpose.\n\nThe Vyatka River, a right tributary of the Kama, sits beside the city of Vyatka, with a defunct port projecting into its depths. It flows from Udmurtia down to the Caspian Sea, passing many cities and towns along the way. The plan is thus: to reopen the wharves of the capital city and to inject into the Vyatka trade and commerce. With this, our vodka and goods can reach the down- and upriver markets, and, one day, maybe Vyatka itself would become a hub of trade."

However, as our industry continues to boom, we need a closer path to trade outside of Russia proper, on account for Brittany's distance and risk. Thankfully, we can solve this quickly.\n\nKostroma is in a convenient position; sandwiched between the Russians and the Germans and serving as a gateway from one to the other. The porous border presents the Russians that rule from across it a soft and easy raiding prey. We, however, have a whole another use for it. By utilizing Kostroma's access to Moskowien, we can reach the innards of the Reich, and gain more profit than ever before. Though it is distasteful to cooperate with the Germans, this is only a temporary measure. The empire will not long stand it."

We are prospering, and every day we inch ever closer to the old, pre-war economy.\n\nThe Emperor is not a complacent man, however. He and his government have put forward a radical plan to recast Vyatka as a trade hub. By rebuilding the roads, restoring the power lines, and expanding the wharves, trade and commerce will take root in Vyatka, cementing its position as the premier trade hub in the region. With this done, Vyatka will be the lighthouse from which imperial glory guides Russia. At its apex, the Emperor will look forward, for the day the two-headed eagle soars again."

When the reports came, he was startled to find that Vyatka has very little. Factories are run-down, bombed. Farmers abandon their fields and return to subsistence farming. Only a few artisans practiced crafts and other industrial methods.\n\nThis has to change. To set the stage for an economic revival, the government has presented to the Emperor a plan for austerity. Though it may be hard to admit, his domain cannot continue to function without a steady amount of cash flow. As such, the government is planning to cut patrols, wages, and what little remained of its educational system.

Whichever the Emperor chooses, he must balance his wish for his people's contentedness with his desire for Russia's reunification under the imperial eagle.\n\nWith that in perspective, the Emperor has the option for his austerity programs to be moderate. Steady cuts to balance the budget are necessary and will continue, but the monarchy adopts for its face a humane one. The Emperor, driven by compassion, will not impose a burden on the people that they cannot bear. Russia can wait; a Russia without its people is no Russia at all."

In his domain alone, the Emperor faces high unemployment and a lack of business initiatives from its people.\n\nTo solve this, an idea has sprung up from the minds of economists working with His Imperial Majesty. They propose for the government to fund public works projects up and down Vyatka, repairing old roads and paving new ones. With this, the government can provide employment and pay to its people, while rebuilding the infrastructure for commerce. An elegant solution, worthy of an Emperor."

What remained of Russia's once robust financial reserves now lay with the communist remnants, with vodka and other valuable goods supplanting the rest. Saving and loans are now concentrated in the village level, without any partial reserve banking plans to encourage commerce.\n\nWith the establishment of public works and austerity programs, the next step to be taken in our economic recovery is the establishment of a central bank. Its establishment will imbue our currency with legitimacy and actual material backing, giving them value. It will also allow the government to regulate interest rates and loan money to enterprising individuals, therefore encouraging economic growth."

Infrastructure projects, welfare, any program that uses up government funds must be reduced in both size and scope. It is likely that the people will not be happy with this decision, but if we want to have any hope of future prosperity it is one that must be taken.

We must therefore work to untangle this web, formalizing the roles of government and getting rid of wasteful excess.

Therefore all he can do for the time being is politely discourage backroom deals and sectarianism, and bide his time until the position of Vyatka is far less tenuous.\n\nIn the meantime, the game will continue as it always has.

The Imperial Council is in agreement that the Emperor's own absolute rulership is necessary at this stage to ensure the rapid consolidation of our conquests and the efficiency of the apparatus of state. The Emperor will officially assume the position of autocrat in an appropriately formal ceremony, solidifying his claim to his rightful imperial domain in western Russia. At the same time, it must be made clear that this is an emergency government, not a permanent solution to our problems. Right now, strong central leadership is needed to guide the ship of state and those aboard to safe harbor - to the reunification."

Right now, even though the star of Vyatka is rising, our position is precarious. One mistake could see the end of our imperial ambitions, yet still the emigre cliques are at each other's throats! Is this what we endured nearly thirty years of exile for - to tear ourselves apart over petty ideological differences? The Emperor cannot abide this any longer.

While in the home front, we rebuild and prepare to finally reunite the nation as a whole, we must also make a breakthrough abroad, shaping our image for the people outside of the country and establishing at least the most primitive diplomatic contacts.\n\nThis is a simple process, yet it requires intensive efforts from Emperor Vladimir's government and the foreign ministry responsible for these affairs. Embassies will be built and reopened, trade deals drafted and diplomatic visits made.\n\nOld contacts we have from the emigré days will certainly be useful as well, to ensure that we are not alone in the struggle for justice and a free Russia."

Only the most experienced, professional and above all loyal diplomats shall be welcomed into the branch, and they will head out of West Russia in every direction imaginable. Trade deals, pacts and alliances are all sealed through hard work, work that the Corps will be responsible for doing.

Of course, if we were to establish a relation with the United States and their allies, our past must be forgotten - something easy, as the monarchy broke the chains of collaborationism as soon as it was left alone in the chaotic environment that was West Russia.\n\nOnce that has been made clear, we can begin to cultivate economic cooperation between the two economies. Our ports in the Arctic Sea, although they may limit us, will become hubs of trade as ships come and leave.

This will be followed by a diplomatic attempt to get even closer to formal recognition, by first getting our "embassy". At first an unofficial consulate designed to facilitate trade between us and the United States, the plan is for it to slowly evolve into an actual diplomatic building through the valiant work of the Imperial Diplomatic Corps.\n\nShould we manage to begin cooperation with the United States of America, then greater things surely lie ahead."

As soon as an area is pacified, the people will have the option to choose their own representatives at the local levele once it is pacified from warlords and bandits. Besides those barred from entering them due to opposing the monarchy, the elections will be free and fair.

By changing electoral law, the values of different votes and reducing the power of the lower classes, Stolypin and the Tsar were able to bypass the reforms made under the pressure of the 1905 Revolution and create a Duma that was loyal and willing to accept their legislation.\n\nA similar endeavour must be undertaken here, to ensure the Solidarist agenda passes through the democratically elected legislature.

The most outspoken NTS supporters will be given promotions, while those who show no support for it will be quietly demoted.

Across the world it was perceived as the final blow in Russian Monarchism, that the surviving Romanovs would live and die as exiles, nothing more. But one man has strives to show the world the folly of such a belief. Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich may have been born into exile, watching from Western Europe as the forces of Bolshevism drove his ancestral land into misery and insanity, but now he has finally returned home.\n\nStyling himself as Emperor Vladimir III, our Emperor returned to Russia among the chaos of the West Russian Offensive in the 1950s and with his German sponsored force captured the city of Vyatka. Yet whilst our journey to this point was tough, it shall pale before the challenges that yet lay ahead.\n\nAs 1962 begins, our Emperor must address the crippled Russian economy, an openly rebellious advisor to the east, an apathetic population and, greatest of all, the eventual unification of Russia herself to rid the motherland of barbaric warlords and finally restore sanity to these lands. With the death of the last Emperor all of Russia's problems began, but with the return of our new Emperor we can surely right the wrongs of the past!"

With a number of our forces armed with German weapons and exercising German training, we have long looked for an opportunity to demonstrate our military has no hidden sympathies for the Reich.\n\nWhilst we are hesitant to use the phrase 'fortunately', one such opportunity has presented itself. Our commanders within Vyatka have received reports that near to the town of Izhevsk a local community has fallen under attack atop what our commanders are calling Hill 483, so named after its listed height upon our maps. Whilst it is unknown specifically whether the attackers are a German raiding force or bandits from Perm, it has reportedly been clear they are followers of Nazi doctrine.\n\nIn response; the Emperor has ordered a task force of 300 trained troops, along with artillery and heavy weaponry, be sent to break the siege of Hill 483. In doing so, we shall ensure none of our people can claim the Emperor nor his military are unwilling to combat Nazism wherever we find it."

Forced to abandon their positions under our firepower and charge down the hill they were met with heavy machine gun fire from our positions, and completely broken the few survivors quickly surrendered.\n\nWhilst hardly a battle for the history books, lasting less than an hour, our men were welcomed as heroes by the community they had saved, receiving flowers and kisses from the grateful locals.\n\nAs a result of our success here, no matter how small, we shall ensure that word spreads across our territory of the competence of our military and our proven willingness to fight those who threaten both our people and to promote Nazism."

Yet our artillery commander refused to give the order, stating it was 'too great of a risk'.\n\nPinned down, our infantry began to take a number of casualties, sustaining more as squads attempted to rescue them before eventually we were forced to pull back. Sensing our failings, the Nazi raiders withdrew among the chaos of battle and dispersed into the surrounding woodland, setting a number of fires to the community atop Hill 483 before they fled.\n\nWhilst this was a small scale conflict, our defeat is being widely considered a disaster. Already a number of accusations have been made that our artillery commander is a Nazi sympathizer who deliberately betrayed us. It seems we have failed to prove to the people the neutrality of our military as this time, and worse still have projected an image of our military ineptitude to our enemies."

In an effort to increase his public perception, demonstrate his lack of support for Germany as well as show his gratitude for the pilots service to Russia the Emperor has decided to make a donation to these brave men and women.\n\nAt his personal expense the Emperor has secured a number of aircraft which he will gift to Free Aviators.

In this time of greatest sorrow, of greatest suffering, of greatest cruelty, I thank you for listening to my voice this evening, be it in your homes, your places of work or on the street. I understand that many of you within this land do not feel as though I am one to be trusted. When there is no trust, it is our nature not to listen. But this evening I address you not as your Emperor, not as your countryman, but simply as a man. A man who feels horror, to his very core, at what has happened to my fellow men and women within this region.\n\nFor two decades now you have been considered less than human. To the Soviet Union you were treated as cogs in an unholy machine. A machine which drew in hope, joy, love and tradition only to spit out sorrow, bloodshed and our downfall. To Germany you were considered animals, no more worthy of consideration than a fox to the hunter. Many of you believe Adolf Hitler and myself to have been in league, and I admit openly to you today that this was, for a time, true. No politician would admit this to you, but I am not addressing you as a politician or a ruler, but as a man. A man who is flawed, who as my priest would say once was blind...but now can see. But for my flaws, I hold one belief I know to be flawless.\n\nYou, the Russian people, are just that. People. We are not cogs in any machine, or animals to be hunted. Together we seek to live, to love, to mourn. We are human beings, no matter how the Bolsheviks or the Nazi's wish to treat us.\n\nI do not ask this day for you to listen to me, because you cannot listen to a man you do not trust. And so I vow to do all that is within my power to earn that trust, and ask for you to give me that chance. I will not dictate I am your leader, like many other before me. I shall earn the right to rule. In a dark room, one's eyes will adjust to the darkness to make them believe that it is hardy dark at all, that such an existence is tolerable. But true light does exist, and together we will find it again. From Vyatka, goodnight. May God watch over you, and guide you on your path.'"

Whilst ethnic Russians dominate the lands we control, there are a number of other smaller cultures scattered across wider Russia and with the current political climate refugees arrive each week seeking safety under the Emperor's rulership.\n\nAs a result, the matter of language at the Emperor's court has been raised. The aristocratic class considers this not to be an issue at all, arguing it makes the most sense to only permit the Russian language at the court due to the dominance of the language already and the lack of multilingual talent among courtiers. Education in our lands is hardly covering mathematics these days, after all.\n\nThe more modern faction within the court, mainly comprising of intellectuals, argue that to only recognize the Russian language would be a step backwards in our efforts to modernize Tsarist rule and alienate a percentage of our population. Both sides make understandable arguments, and which way the Emperor will rule nobody is quite sure of although highly anticipated."

Law enforcement arrived in time to save the man from being beaten to death and placed the aristocrat under arrest. Yet a few hours later, he was set free with no charges due to a classic case of 'friends in high places'.\n\nThe incident has caused outrage among the people of Vyatka and highly divided the court. The modernist faction within the court, frequently advocating for a more open and fair society have rallied the populace behind their belief that the rule of law must be enforced across our lands rigorously. No-one should be above the law, they demand.\n\nYet the aristocratic faction within the court are almost entirely united behind the notion that as the nobility and ruling class that they should be entitled to certain... exemptions from the legal code as befitting their status and to better allow their rulership to be enacted. The argument has reached a head, and the Emperor must publicly declare a position before the court."

Attempts to remove the bandits let to a firefight and their wholesale deaths, but much of the equipment and the building was left intact.\n\nWith large scale industry rendered impossible due to Luftwaffe bombings the Emperor has instructed that the distillery should be at last re-opened and put to work producing one of Russia's most treasured resources: high quality vodka. Such small scale industry but with a significant market across Russia would provide an excellent boost to our economy the Emperor believes, and will open the door to more substantial industry in our future.\n\nIt will be some time before we can produce vodka on mass, and of a worthwhile quality, but the Emperor has authorized the necessary subsidies and investments to allow production to begin. All that remains is to clear up the distillery and get to work."

Whilst resistance was attempted in the earlier days, any anti-air emplacements have been long since destroyed or stolen by raiding rival warlords. For now our economic options are severely limited in the face of such aerial might, yet we can attempt to lay some foundations.

The big question however is just how extreme the austerity program should be.\n\nThe majority of the Emperor's advisors have advised moderation based around cuts to public services including education, leisure centers and healthcare. The Emperor's more extreme advisors however have claimed the only way to make a real impact will be to commit to the most brutal of spending cuts, slashing everything aside from military spending and a select few stimulus projects.\n\nAny cuts at all will not be popular with the people under our rule, but Emperor must decide to what extent rebuilding the economy is worth the common folk scorning his name."

Men dressed in rough fabric are hauling boxes of goods and barrels of vodka, from the newly-minted warehouses to piers teeming with rotten wood into a steamer salvaged from the old days. Underwriters scurry up and down the quays, noting every detail of the freight. A few laborers follow them, carrying scales and weighing the cargo. Shouts of the foremen, coarse jokes exchanged as workers pass each other by, crashing crates and the subsequent cursing, all blend into a din of a city roused awake.\n\nFrom the bridge of the steamer, peering from the window down to the deck, the Emperor looks at his people as they toil and work, in laughter and happiness that he had not seen for years. Here, deep in the head of the beast, his eyes glaze over with the thought of being kept away from partaking in the joy he helped create. It was dead silent there, in its nervous stem. A silence that was only broken by the clinking of the wine glasses, and the captain's slow, subdued talk. He says yes, and nods his head, but words flow into his ear and out the other. He wanted to stretch his legs on the pier and deck, not here, suffocated with bromide and formality.\n\nSomething touched his shoulder. It was the captain's hand. "Are you all right, Your Majesty?" said the concerned voice, "Would you like to sit down for a while?"\n\n"No, I'm fine." He had to reassure the officer several times. The skipper continued his talk. "As I said, Your Majesty's aid is highly valued at this juncture. There are rumors of river pirates gathering downstream, along the route that we plan to take the ship in. Your humble servant requests for more guards to ensure the safety and success of this undertaking." The Emperor looked at him, incredulous.

Mid-stream, amid the riffle, the Emperor's steamer was anchored, with a few men bearing rifles on over watch duty, from port side to starboard. Using the noise and momentum of the runs, several boats with ragged men in them drifted to both sides of the ship, avoiding the scrutiny of the electric lights. Aligning themselves parallel to it, they threw grappling hooks on board, securing these using the taffrails as a base. After making sure that the hooks were stable, they tied the ropes to their boats and began climbing.\n\nBefore they could clamber atop the decks, a guard, assigned as a precautionary measure by the Emperor, discovered the hooks. He swung his flashlight to see several armed men trying desperately to reach the end of the rope. He shouted, "Alarm!" and kicked at the hook. Screams rose above the din of the river, followed by splashing sounds. All over the steamer, the crew was waking up. After a few gunshots up and down the ship, everything calmed down. The river pirates did not manage to do anything apart from making the guards waste a few bullet cartridges. Come daylight, the vessel would continue on its way, as if nothing happened at all."

After a few days, the soldiers tasked with such came back and presented to the Emperor their discovery.\n\nThey found the vessel beached along the meandering banks of the Vyatka, it's starboard and port side paddles buried in the ground, broken. The captain was dead, along with many of the crew. The river pirates had killed them. Not only that, they had stolen most of the cargo and was no doubt guzzling down the vodka or worse, selling it, wreaking havoc on the delicate balance of the market.\n\nAfter hearing this, the Emperor's eyes sunk. He held his hands on his face. Guilt settled on his back, bending his elbows against his knees. He had sent loyal men, who believed in him, to their deaths. The craftsmanship and labor of his people were lost as well. After a few moments, he stood up and dismissed the soldiers, thanking them for doing their duty. Alone in his chambers, he sighed."

More than that, they promised protection from the bandits who lurked across the border, the ones of unspeakable cruelty and madness, or so the stories told. He even let one of them stay in an empty room of his small house, formerly occupied by his late wife. Each morning they would share a meal, and then the soldier would go off to join a patrol, returning in the evening just in time for dinner.\n\nFor the first two weeks nothing happened, and this routine repeated itself again and again. The man asked the soldier whether he even needed to be here at all, an inquiry to which he answered with a vague shrug of his shoulders. Inevitably, however, the night arrived on which that question was answered. Armed men carrying a strange banner were spotted exiting a forest beyond the village, and the tsarist forces manned the defensive positions they had prepared over the previous weeks. The man observed from behind a low stone wall next to his house, and from it he realized that they outnumbered his protectors two-to-one at least. He considered running while the line held, but quickly realized that he had overestimated these bandits who claimed to be among the master race. Seemingly possessed by more fanaticism than sense, they charged headlong across the open field, and within ten minutes all of them were cut down or fleeing for their lives.\n\nThe victorious soldiers assembled in the center of the village for a headcount. All were present - except one. A search quickly turned him up lying behind a dirt defilade, a bullet hole through the center of his chest. The man quickly realized that this was the man he had sheltered, but displayed no outward emotion. The following morning he volunteered to dig the soldier's grave and manufacture a cross to mark it."

It is true, brothers and sisters, that we live amid the dark, but lo, daybreak awaits!"\n\nLeaning forward, he continued, "This I pray every night, brothers and sisters!

He had attempted to call him twice already, and was beginning to lose what little patience he hadn't already. After what felt like hours, a familiar voice could be heard on the other end. "Col. Gavrilov speaking, this had better be important."\n\n"Sir, this is Lieutenant Cherdenko. As per your request, I've been out trying to get ahold of those rifles we purchased last week. I apologize, but I'm afraid it's going to be a while before they'll make it to our troops." Cherdenko tried his best to mask his frustration, but deep down he knew speaking to the colonel was going to push him over the edge "I don't understand, lieutenant. The guns are right there at the warehouse! All you had to do was go down there, sign a few things and be on your way. So tell me, what's the hold up here?" Cherdenko closed his eyes and let out a worn-out sigh as his superior talked.\n\nCollecting himself, he firmly grasped the phone and let loose. "All due respect sir, I'm losing my goddamn mind out here. I've been running my ass ragged all over this goddamn town signing documents and trying to find the one guy I'm supposed to talk to about these damn rifles, and every single one sends me to some other agency i've never even heard of to sign more documents and seek out even more officials for their stamps of approval! I'm waist-deep in red tape here and feeling my sanity waver as we speak!" This tirade had been building inside Cherdenko for hours, and it had left the lieutenant out of breath. "Just calm down, lieutenant. I understand your frustration, but this is simply how things operate around here. I'll try to make a few calls on your behalf, but you'll just have to endure until we get our munitions. Do you understand?" Cherdenko was exhausted, and no longer had the will to bash his head against the wall of bureaucracy. "Yes sir." The colonel hung up in response, and Cherdenko put the phone back in its place.

"You would have us bend over backwards for all kinds of anti-Russian forces when our own countrymen haven't even accepted our rule yet? What kind of insanity are you suggesting here, Roman?!" Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn spat at his opponent, almost screaming at this point.\n\nRoman Gul quickly stood up from his chair in protest. "Insanity?! You and the rest of your cronies are living in the past, Aleksandr. I won't allow you to fill the Emperor's head with your poisonous nonsense on my watch, not when Russia's future is at stake!" Vladimir had thought, perhaps naively, that the painkillers would see him through this gruelling affair without much fuss. Feeling a migraine coming on, the Emperor realized that he had underestimated the stress that today had in store for him. Suddenly, Vladimir was snapped out of his fog by the voice of Vasily Shulgin, who finally spoke up. "My liege, would you care to weigh in on all this? You've been rather quiet today." Vladimir lifted his head, his eyes darting around the table at the attendees. An awkward silence had washed over the room, and now every single person at the meeting was staring directly at him, awaiting an answer. The migraine was only getting worse. After a beat, the Emperor finally spoke. "You have all spoken well today, and while your arguments are sound I will require some time to carefully consider your positions. Now, if you would forgive me, I must excuse myself for a moment."\n\nWith that, Vladimir promptly got up and exited the room along with his retainers.

 KIR.20.desc:0 "Our agents in Kostroma have reported back to us that they have been approached with a rather interesting proposal from a most unexpected source: Vyatka. It would appear that Emperor Vladimir's government has recently constructed a vodka distillery within their territory and is looking for buyers. Well, if smuggling alcohol out of Russia is their goal, they could hardly have picked better people to do it. The only question is whether or not we will accept the deal.\n\nThe Emperor's men drive a hard bargain: since the end of the Second World War, Russian-brewed vodka has been in short supply in the West. Indeed, the very first shipment received will probably pay itself back several times over. Collaboration with one of the only vestiges of monarchism in Russia would also serve to ingratiate ourselves with White émigrés, many of whom sit upon large piles of cash. The opportunities that trade with Vyatka could present to us are numerous, but so are the risks.\n\nBesides the resources that will be needed to establish the route, our greatest problem will be getting the vodka across Europe in the first place - a treacherous journey through German-occupied territory and the banditry that plagues Russia. Even as few as a dozen crates being lost per month could substantially cut into our profits. There is also the issue of the general instability of Russia as a whole. Vyatka could easily cease to exist in half a decade, and our relations with them would hardly endear us to whoever takes their place.\n\nWith all of this in mind, should we accept the Emperor's offer with a handshake, or politely turn it down and search for better opportunities? Our men in Kostroma are eagerly awaiting a response."

They have managed to negotiate their share of the profits up slightly, but the vast majority of the money generated from this enterprise will still be going into the Emperor's treasury.\n\nAll that remains, then, is for us to uphold our end of the bargain. Already the first truckload of alcohol is being loaded to be sent towards our northern border, amply guarded by some of our finest soldiers, where it will be transferred to Breton control before making its way across Europe. There it will then be loaded onto ships and sold to whoever has the money to buy, which will be a great many people thanks to the demand for quality vodka in the West.\n\nThe Bretons have promised their first payment in one month's time, and soon foreign currency will be flooding into Vyatka, bolstering the little we have been receiving thus far. This will give us substantial leeway for investment into arms and industry, something that will surely be helped by our new friends on the other side of the continent. Indeed, plans are already being drawn up to expand our distillery in case demand proves high enough. It will not be long before knowledge of Vyatkan vodka spreads worldwide, and our brewers will come to be known as not mere workers, but craftsmen of the highest calibre."

Cited were the risks of transporting the vodka across Europe and our "questionable ability to meet demand." This is a grave mistake on Brittany's part, of course, but it seems that they have made up their mind.\n\nIt seems, therefore, that our distillery will have to remain focused on domestic production. Overall this has been a major blow to our efforts to obtain foreign currency, and for the foreseeable future it seems we will have to continue relying on that which we receive from émigrés abroad.\n\nNonetheless our distillery is still proving to be a worthwhile investment, and all hope is not lost for trading our vodka abroad. Several of our closer neighbors could still prove to be interested in acquiring more alcoholic beverages, and as our power grows we could easily end up doing ourselves what we have had to rely on the Bretons for at present."

This entire investigation had began from one raid into a house, which allegedly belonged to a "revolutionary". There, an encrypted letter had been discovered, and after following clue after clue, the Okhrana had located a total of six suspects that were suspected of aiming to subvert the Emperor's regime, possibly following orders from Arkhangelsk. While all six claimed to be innocent and have no idea of who the others were, perhaps some more pressure could change their minds.\n\nThe sun slowly rose from the horizon, and everyone in the room began to realize for how long they had been in there. The different methods of torture used by the agents were too many to count on one's fingers, and not all of them were part of the rule book of the secret police. It seemed that there was no other solution than to kill all the dissidents, but in the end, one of them confessed. He admitted to the existence of an espionage group situated in Vyatka, or as they called it, Rykov, whose purpose was none other than to destroy the Tsarist regime just like in 1917. However, other than that, not much more information could be extracted from them. For the two agents, they were useless.\n\nFrom the dark room just outside of Vyatka, six gunshots were heard, and echoed on the hillside.

As the council sat down, one of the more ambitious members of the council started out: "Alright, since this meeting has been called to order, I move that we prioritize the development of infrastructure across our territory -"\n\nHe never got to finish, as he was interrupted by a second individual. "No, no. No. Infrastructure is certainly important, but it means nothing if we can't secure the countryside from the bandits..."\n\nThe meeting lasted nearly two hours, and despite the initial poor prospect of success, as the council left the meeting room all were satisfied. Sure; most, if not all, had differing agendas. But all were ultimately dedicated to the extension of the monarchy eastwards, and compromises were made.

"Autocracy and despotism is a relic of the old days, of my ancestors who governed a country in a different situation and a different era.

Rest assured that, as soon as these threats have been dealt with, and stability has returned to the region, I will call for the formation of a democratic congress that will decide how to govern this country, in peaceful co-existence with the monarchy.

Maybe it was some sort of divine punishment for having assisted the fascists almost a decade ago.

It was a mess, a sorry mess, its government as divided as Russia itself. And to think that these were the people who were supposed to restore the Empire! Sighing, he laid back into his pillow; he wanted to laugh, but knew that it would only increase the pain that had ingrained itself in his forehead. Was it really so hard for his ministers to unify themselves behind him, even if it was for just a moment?

For his loyalty, and the possible danger he presented, he was awarded with the title of Governor of Berezniki. A territory on the frontier of the pocket of monarchism we fiercely defend, Berezniki was painfully pacified by Kazembek and his political allies. It remains surrounded by evil snakes to this day, from the "Aryan Brotherhood" in the south to the theocrats in the north. Against the odds, the viceroyalty for the leader of the Mladorossi, has survived.\n\nIn fact, it has thrived. Reports on the territory state that Kazembek always makes sure that, no matter what, the valuable oil in the territory reaches the hands of Vyatka's government. As much as some in the cabinet may dislike him, the Governor is crucial to the maintenance of peace in the region and the arrival of resources to the Tsar, and our liaison, Boris Skosyrev, is there to ensure that.\n\nOne could say that everything, from the "loyalty" of Kazembek to the consistent flow of petroleum to Vyatka, is merely the lip service he pays, for his goals are beyond being a puppet of the monarch. Many in the Imperial Council, which His Imperial Majesty created, believe that Kazembek may be looking to drift away from the central authority that he is de jure subordinate to.

But, for them specifically to have been called to action and by the secret police itself, it was something more than that.\n\nYevgeny was the first to arrive in the crime scene. He quickly moved through all the barriers and hurdles set up by the police, simply showing his badge to anyone who questioned him, and entered the house. In front of him was the dead body of a man, who was apparently a government official in the Ministry of Finance. The agent was quickly joined by Valentin, and both immediately knew why they were the ones to have been called. For a few days now, they had been working together on investigating the existence of a complex spy network in the heart of the Empire, crafted by dissidents to plot the destruction of Vyatka by the inside.\n\nAt a first glance, the connections to such a spy ring seemed almost non-existent. The leads that could help figure out who did this and why were nowhere to be found, even if they felt that they already knew the answers to both questions. Despite that, this could be what they needed to reach deeper into the connections of the group, and finally destroy it once and for all."

It wasn't that complicated; the man had been shot from behind while making food in the kitchen. The bullet seemed to be from a pistol, and was sent back to the headquarters to examine where the gun had been manufactured and by whom. In the meantime, Valentin and Yevgeny continued their search, and soon found something quite intriguing: a box of letters. More specifically, between those received by family and friends, or fellow officers, there was one letter sent by "Kachestvennaya Dostavka", a company that seemed to be handling shipments in and around West Russia. The official seemed to have been in contact with them, and so perhaps they could get something out of this lead. In fact, he had been recently dealing with shipments in and out of the city of Izhevsk, known for its industry.\n\nA few hours later, a formal request would be sent to investigate a warehouse belonging to Kachestvennaya Dostavka for the case of the dissident group, that could threaten the regime itself.

Perhaps they and the official who had been recently killed had some connection.\n\nEventually, the manifest for the warehouse was found. It was nothing more than a long list of names, dates and locations, but it could be extremely useful. After looking through the files, a suspect was found. The man was responsible mainly for transports from and to Izhevsk on behalf of Kachestvennaya Dostavka, and would definitely share some connections with the poor government official. What was most odd, though, was his name: Koronovanny Bryukho.\n\nThis was clearly not real, but it perfectly fit the role of a nickname or a fake name.

For all they knew, this could have been completely false information. But if it was false, he had done a damn good job in making it look believable. It truly looked like a normal house for a working class family.\n\nHowever, if one looked below the surface, both figuratively and literally, much more could be found. It did not take long until the two agents, well-trained in discovering hidden secrets, discovered a trapdoor, which led to a dark, dusty basement, which was, just like many things in the house, more important than it initially appeared.\n\nInside the basement, folders and files could be seen covering an entire office, and were also chaotically spread around the room. Valentin took one of the folders, which was noteworthy in having the word "CONFIDENTIAL" on it with big, red letters. A look at the document's title was enough: "Izhevsk Plant Sabotage Operation - Plan Eagle". The exact plans and ideas were still not exactly clear, but the mere mention of such a plan by this mysterious man was enough to justify action.

The two Okhrana agents arriving at the city in secrecy were not going to tour the factories, though, as there were more urgent matters to attend to.\n\nThe link between the official from the Ministry of Finance and Izhevsk was one of the most important leads Valentin and Yevgeny had in their hands. Everything pointed to this area as the next logical step in the search to trace his enemies.\n\nAnd so, the two agents spent their day investigating. Contacts of the man were asked, but knew little about him or what he was recently doing. Companies that had also come in contact with him seemed to lead nowhere as well.

The agents fell down from the ensuing shockwave, and so did many of the workers, confused as to what was happening. Instinctively, Yevgeny turned around, and could see a massive cloud of smoke begin to cover the entire factory, as the explosion that had rocked it became clear. Chaos had erupted in the building: people screamed and ran in all directions, and the fine-tuned mechanism they all formed and maintained was being torn apart.\n\nAmidst the smoke and the ruins, Yevgeny spotted a figure.

Wearing dark clothes, he carefully moved through the machines and industrial parts, as if he did not want to be seen. In his hand was a device, that he adjusted and tinkered as he walked. Yevgeny was the first to react, yelling, and thankfully for the two agents, the Okhrana special team was there to help. The figure made a final adjustment to the device, dropped it, and started running.\n\nValentin nodded to the team to take care of the device as he and his colleague chased the saboteur.

With no hesitation, he swung it wide open, and a few seconds later, the agents followed him. The door led into a staircase, which likely connected all floors and could be used to get out fast. As Valentin hastily went down the stairs, the saboteur turned around and looked at him for a second. Still, that second was enough for Valentin to get a clear look of his face: he was in his twenties, much younger than himself, and probably more active as well.\n\nThe staircase ended, and led to what appeared to be a large space sheltered from the weather by a fabric, dotted with industrial equipment in action.

However, that was not for good, as now, numerous roads and paths to other factories and neighborhoods appeared ahead of them. The saboteur was nowhere to be seen, and they had no idea where he could have gone. The agents stopped their efforts, realizing that it was now a lost cause. Using their radio, they contacted the regional Okhrana headquarters.\n\n"This is agents Markov and Nesterov. We have information on the perpetrator of the attack in the Izhevsk industrial complex, the suspect, around twenty-five years old, brown hair and green eyes, was the one to set the device and remains at large. He left the building from the South entrance two minutes ago, so he can't have gone far."\n\nDespite that, Valentin knew inside him that there was no way they would catch him.

They would be relieved of all their duties in the secret police. There was no need to sign a contract stating they would keep all of their work in the agency secret as civilians. They already knew all too well what would happen if they leaked any kind of information.\n\nBoth men would return to their families, seemingly happy that they could now enjoy their lives to the fullest, and do what they want.

Of course, it had been a good week for the secret police; a spy ring seeking to overthrow the government had been discovered, and a plan for a bombing attack at Izhevsk had been discovered and foiled. However, the situation was not as perfect as one would think.\n\nFor just a few seconds, the two agents, experienced in dirty work yet relatively new in the Emperor's police, had lost the suspect. Quite clearly guilty of setting up the attack, at least its final stages which ultimately failed, he had managed to outrun them and get away, lost in the vast lands of the West Russian plains and forests, or even outside the Emperor's territory. And the Okhrana was not known for being kind to those who did not complete their missions to the fullest, especially when that mission had to do with an extremist terrorist group possibly backed by the remnants of the WRRF to Vyatka's north.\n\nThe names Markov and Nesterov would not be glorified as heroes of the monarchist government in its struggle of survival and reunification. Instead, they would remain mostly forgotten. Should one search for them, all they would find would be a dusty, classified personnel list of the Guard Department, cataloguing these two men as once field agents, then officials, having nothing more than desk jobs in regional departments far from any major city."

Whenever he found the opportunity to do so, he tried to set up hurdles for the people running after him. At that point, Valentin wondered if the terrorist knew who was actually after him. While the secret police would be the obvious thought when you had just set up a bombing attack, who knew what connections he had with the underworld?\n\nYevgeny decided it was time to use his weapon. They had been hunting him down for some time now, and they did not want to gather the attention of everyone around them by firing with the target still not clearly in sight. But now, the perfect opportunity presented itself. He took out the pistol he carried, and fired the first shot. It missed, but he only kept firing. The bullets were grazing past the terrorist, instead hitting the floor or industrial machinery.\n\nThe mysterious man had by now exited the factory complex, arriving at a road just outside, leading to central Izhevsk. Just as he thought he had escaped, and was just about to climb over the fence to get out, he was knocked down by someone. That someone was Valentin, who with all his force had thrown his target on the floor, and was threatening him with his own pistol. The man was going nowhere now."

As per the newspapers and the radio, a large explosion had occurred at an arms manufacturing plant in the suburbs of the city, known for its industry. The only casualties had been three deaths, and more than a dozen injuries, all by workers there. However, what to the public was nothing more than an unfortunate, but in the grand scheme unimportant, incident, was much more important affair for the Okhrana.\n\nThe arrest of the attack's perpetrator, a young man who was later traced to come from the town of Glazov, paved the way for further successes by the Guard Department. With the participation of agents Markov and Nesterov, the Izhevsk Case, as it came to be called, would be investigated further.\n\nThe saboteur proved to be, as the agents had expected, merely a small piece in a large puzzle. A spy ring, comprised of both infiltrators from the government of the West Russian Revolutionary Front to the north and local dissidents that were reached out to, had been in the works for months now, managing to operate under the noses of His Imperial Majesty's. As it turned out, with the first move they tried to make, the group stumbled and was mostly rooted out by the Okhrana, which would carry out more than thirty arrests as part of the case. Of course, all this would be done with the two agents supervising, now from their positions of power in the secret police.

 KIR.44.desc:0 "In a nation ravaged by conflicts, warlordism, and clashing interests of dozens of actors, espionage is often seen as an effective way to weaken or defeat your enemy. Perhaps that was what the enemies of Emperor Vladimir thought of when first setting up the spy ring aimed at overthrowing him. Whether they enjoyed popular support was doubtful, and as such, they likely had to resort to more extreme solutions, namely sabotage and terrorism, with no real hope of taking power for themselves. Unfortunately for them, the nation they were in had the Okhrana.\n\nWhen it came to fighting threats to the government they served, the secret police had no reservations, and it showed no kindness. This was the case in the Izhevsk Operation as well. The instant the bombing in Izhevsk was foiled, the brave agents Valentin Markov and Yevgeny Nesterov were called upon by the government itself to combat the threat the extremist group that had attempted the attack presented. With the leads from the investigation of the government official, and the clues from the saboteur, taking down the entire spy ring was only a matter of time.\n\nOne connection led to the other, and soon dozens of arrests in the name of state security were ordered. It did not take long until the entirety of the group, from its origins to its exact plans, had been discovered. Thus, the case closed, and the Okhrana continued normal business. As for the two agents that had spearheaded the entire operation, they became heroes of the nation, not in public, but in the government and the intelligence of Vyatka. Soon, entire departments of the Okhrana would be headed by them, as they gained more experience and more power, which they had decided to devote to His Imperial Majesty."

 KIR.45.desc:0 ""Wetwork" was the term the Russians used for the job the Okhrana was responsible of. When a job had to be done, secretly and efficiently, in the name of the Emperor, the Okhrana would be there to help. The system within the ranks of the secret police was one rarely based on actual skills, but power, influence, and simple experience, and that was a system that agents Valentin and Yevgeny maneuvered through in their years in the service.\n\nSometimes, the cases they were assigned to were simple. It could be interception of communication or raids in houses, to examine if a suspect was truly guilty of harboring anti-Tsarist sentiments. Usually, that was not the case, but it was a common occurrence. And when that occurred, said person would have to be "dealt with", one way or the other.\n\nThat could mean just a simple arrest, and from that point the fate of these people only became known to the upper echelons of the Guard, a position difficult to reach, even though the two agents achieved it. Other times, the two agents had to personally take care of issues, and that could mean executions, torturing, and more. Admittedly, they did not seem to care much for the lives they ended or irreversibly twisted.\n\nEfficiency was the system the Okhrana operated on, and Valentin and Yevgeny, after years of hard practice and actual experience in the field, mastered it. To them, being assigned to a mission to take down an entire revolutionary group became an easy mission. In fact, it reminded them of their early days, when they were not the ones pulling the strings, but simply obeyed the orders of the ones above them. But with every mission completed, every radical arrested and every enemy dealt with, they climbed just a little higher in the hierarchy of the Okhrana, the ultimate aim being to always serve the Emperor, no matter what."

It was twenty minutes out from the sunset, from when the Sabbath would begin, and work ceased. He pulled out a match and lit it, and warm light trickled into the room, a lone spark against the dark, a flicker in the world so prejudiced against his faith. Holding it before his face, he let the warmth engulf his lips, as memories of his wife and family seeped into his nostrils, an aroma he thought he had forgotten.\n\nHe straightened the wicks of the candles and set them ablaze, as warm light poured into the room, and a faint scent of burning fat immersed his sense of smell. The fires and the shadows danced, at the foot of his tables and chairs, on the surfaces of his drawers and shelves. Two points of light, two towers of flickering fire, a delight before the eyes of the Lord; a call to prayer before the day of rest begun. He extended his hands over the candles, drawing their light towards him, in the empty hope of bringing the flames to also burn within him.\n\n"Blessed are You," he said, drawing a deep breath and closing his eyes, "Hashem, our God," over this word, he trembled, but proceeded, "King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the light of Shabbos." Thus the Sabbath had begun, but he did not unclasp his sight. He thought of all the Jews in the world. He drifted to the memory, long lost, of his wife and children, as ashes coated his thoughts.

They often loafed around the Jewish slaughterhouse, and as of late, Rivkin had become a sort of favorite for them. They would jeer at him and throw insults and slurs his way, a steady stream of reminders of what Rivkin was: a Jew. A stranger in a strange land, a traveler in a world hostile to nomads and exiles.\n\nHe tried his best to ignore them. He eyed the batons on their hips and the sharp heels of their boots. Turning his head down, he decided to hurry past them, before one of the thugs in black seized his shoulders, halting his pace. A group of four men immediately surrounded him, the stream of slurs and insults steadily becoming a torrent that crashed against his ears, minute by minute.\n\nOne of the men, a well-known Boris from an uptown family, took a piece of pork out of his pocket. "Poor Jew," he said, unctuously, "in recognition of your plight, I offer you something to eat." Rivkin shook his head. "Oh? Do you think you are better than us," Boris said, unholstering his baton, "Jew?" He screamed, in a voice of shrill hatred, as he clubbed Rivkin to the ground, with the other three following in his footsteps. What was a torrent had become a flood, and a hail of pain rained unto Rivkin's body.\n\nWhen they were done, the poor Jew was unconscious. "Search for," Boris gasped for breath, "search for gold on him. He should have some." The onlookers watched but did not intervene, as the four men rifled through Rivkin's pockets and clothes in search of treasure.

The press has solid, concrete proof that you perpetrated crimes of hatred against the Jews of my domain."\n\n"Sire, I know that my actions have caused you undue concern," Boris said, his voice trembling with fear, "but my father, one of your many esteemed councilors, fought with you since the start of the Reclamation. Please, in recognition of his deeds, let me go." He dared himself to look upwards, towards the throne, "Why let the matter of a Jew tear our empire apart? Your Imperial Majesty, I hope you recognize our support for your rule has been unconditional, and should you let this matter go, we would be forever indebted to you." He peered down. "On the other hand, should this get out of control, we cannot guarantee anything."\n\nA few minutes passed before Vladimir said, in a careful, measured pace, "Fine.

These telegrams and letters tell a story of a man driven to the betrayal of his nation for the sake of power. Though the Emperor has done his best to silence the truth, the Vyatka Tribune is proud to proclaim that no suppression shall ever deter the Tribune from its stated mission.\n\nSamples of such conversations and interviews, as well as examples of communications, can be found below...\n\n(continued at page 5)"

The Emperor, in acknowledgment of his talents, has appointed him the Officer of the Press and told him to run damage control. Not the most select assignment, but work is work.\n\n"For today," Gul began, his throat hoarse in his old age, "get the paperwork done and revoke the Vyatka Tribune's press clearances. Anything more they put to print is slander." On paper, Gul was the Emperor's Foreign Minister, not his secretary. In effect, however, he was perhaps the most qualified member in his cabinet to handle such affairs.\n\nIt was going to be a long day. The Vyatka Tribune, his arch-enemy during this crisis, has done everything in their power to fight censorship. When they could not attack the Emperor, they struck his parents, when they found the Emperor's character impervious, they struck Gul. More and more of the press had rallied to the Tribune, forming a united front against Gul and his band of military officers conscripted to handle press affairs.\n\nThere were what Gul would charmingly call "fuck-ups;" these officers sometimes handled delicate matters with the soft touch needed to pull a trigger.

At least Gul and his press corps provided a brief refuge from it all. The nobility and the Corps, however, he had to face alone.\n\nThe letter on his right hand was something a little different than what he usually did as an Emperor. He gritted his teeth. He should have done the right thing before all of this spiraled out of his control. Such was the nature of hindsight, however - everything only became apparent in retrospect. The letter contained an apology and a promise for compensation. For a brief moment, Vladimir had deserted his people for his gain. As the press would tell it, he had abandoned them twice. The nobility and the Corps would crucify him, but doing the right thing was never easy.\n\nOn his right hand, however, was a lighter. His position as an Emperor was crucial to him, something his family had worked to achieve for decades. His crown, as burdensome as it was, was his cross. The Moyazhev kid had been right in some way. Why let the simple matter of a wounded Jew be the breaking point of an alliance that would finally restore Russia to its place among the powers of the world? Simply set his letter on fire, and let the matter be buried for historians to discover.\n\nHe could not take it any longer.

In the time that proceeded since I have vacillated between denouncing the hatred that had almost killed you on the streets of my domain and suppressing information that would harm me.\n\nHowever, I realize that my apology by its lonesome would not be enough. Good men, in my experience, find that words are not enough for harm caused by actions. For you and your family, I shall compensate for whatever loss incurred by the attack. For you personally, I shall give a position that my Imperial authority shall protect. For all the Jews in the Empire, I denounce the hatred that has, for so long, harmed their livelihood and survival. No longer shall the Corps be given free rein over you.\n\nMy trusted advisor, Roman Gul, had implored me since the beginning to do the "right thing." A nebulous conception; a monarch should not dwell in the morals of his actions. However, I send this to you, not as the Emperor of Russia and all her dominions, but as a person to another.

Don't go ahead by yourself," a woman's voice said, her tones loving and tender, "your arms are not fully well yet. Here," she heaved his suitcase with her two hands, "let me help." Dear, sweet Rahel, a blessing by the Lord upon his life. A widow left with no child, whose husband died in the West Russian War.

He could already imagine his words being played again and again in the televisions of America, Germany and Italy. Would it touch his subjects in Russian lands, though? It was no secret that support for the monarchy was abysmal since 1917, and despite all the propaganda and the development projects and the military success, many still remained unconvinced.\n\nMonarchism seemed dead as an ideology in his homeland, yet Vladimir had revived it. He tried to forget the dark past, like the days of collaboration with the Wehrmacht or some bad things his army had made when they took over cities. He had committed many sins, but he knew God would forgive them, and so he looked to the future, thinking of what it would entail. Enemies were still abundant - there were numerous warlords standing in the way of Russian unification, and some powers abroad would surely try to act against the great Sovereignty of Western Russia. That was not to say that matters within the Empire's borders had all been solved, with bandits and partisans still active in liberated areas, and political intrigues and machinations in the royal court growing exponentially. Vladimir would soon have to make hard choices, and he was unsure if he was ready for that."

Atop the faded desk mat stood a small bronze plaque, adorned with the man's own name, Boris Smyslovsky.\n\nTo others, this cramped office with its small desk and plaque would mean almost nothing, but to Boris, it was the culmination of decades of work. It was the culmination of two wars, both of which he'd fought in, a forced alliance with the Germans, and years of political manipulation.\n\nSmyslovsky broke his gaze, closing the door behind him as he moved to sit down in the chair behind the desk. The desk suited the man well, for despite the desk's rather mundane appearance, it would soon be participating in some of the most momentous work in all of Russia, just as the man sitting behind it would be.

Most of its passengers refugees of one sort or another -- fleeing from their dead nations, their brutal governments, or any manner of the other black beasts and evil men who infested the world. Among them, who had paid fifteen American dollars to get passage but not the twenty to have a cabin, was General Nikolay Rumyantsev.\n\nTo the other passengers, he was just a quiet Slavic fellow with a French accent. Possessed of a weathered, tired face framed by grey hair and whiskers, his old age and tattered clothing could not entirely conceal his lean and muscular build, or the way that his searching hungry eyes darted from place to place, measured and calculating.\n\nGeneral Rumyantsev had been born a soldier, and intended to die as one. He had fled the corruption and autocracy of the Old Russian Empire to join a force that he could fight for without the same - the French Foreign Legion. There he had marched from one desert fort to another, made friends and enemies alike among the natives, and written anti-Bolshivik missives to the journals he received by mail.\n\nHe hadn'tdared to dream that he would return to his homeland, just as he hadn't even considered the possibility that France might fall. He had thought of France as his new nation, and the Foreign Legion as his home.\n\nBut the war had changed everything. The iron grip of communism in Russia fell before the German beast, as had De Gaulle's fury and the dogged persistence of the Foreign Legion. Once more Rumyantsev found himself adrift. For a time he had considered drifting south to die with his legion in the humid West African jungle, later finding a small cottage somewhere in which to spend his last years.\n\nBut defeat ahd awakened something in Rumyantsev, something old and forgotten. He was still a soldier. He was still Russian. When word reached him of Emperor Vladimir returning to lead his nation against the Communist and Fascist occupiers alike, he realized he had no choice but to go to him, serve him in one last war, and die as he lived: fighting for his beliefs and nations.\n\nThe Defiant would find a harbor in Persia, from which Nikolay would begin the last stage of his journey.

Following a short exchange between the diplomatic offices of us and the Tsarists, a meeting was scheduled to be held in Yurla, a city right on the demarcation line between Berezniki and Vyatka.\n\nThe Tsar has made his appearance in the conference, which is held in the Mayor's residence, the best and most majestic building not destroyed by the German bombs. So has our leader, Alexander Kazembek, bringing his own group of guards to protect him. While the event is happening amidst tensions in the region and between the two old allies, there is still hope on the horizon.\n\nVladimir has been quite open, offering the peaceful re-integration of Berezniki. While an outright annexation has been blatantly refused, should the hardliner Tsarists make some concessions, this could be achievable. All that is now left for us is to play the game of negotiations, and see if a mutually favorable deal can be achieved."

Thankfully, Kazembek and his diplomatic mission showed understanding and respect, something which allowed us to re-integrate his fiefdom with only a few concessions. First and foremost, complete amnesty will be offered to him and whatever officers or politicians followed him in establishing the territory of Berezniki, thus ending his fears of being punished for his actions. Secondly, the Young Russians will be free to participate in any democratic processes of the Empire, separately or on behalf of an existing movement, and will not be persecuted by the Tsar or the Okhrana. Finally, a decree on the laws surrounding labor unions will be issued. Seeing as at its core, the Mladorossi movement cared for the people and the workers, these laws that will allow them to operate more freely were able to win over Kazembek and make him agree to reunification.\n\nVyatka has celebrated the acquisition of Berezniki through peaceful means, and both the populace and the elite are satisfied by this outcome.

The Tsar and his advisors from now on consider Berezniki a rogue, breakaway state, and intend to reclaim it as soon as possible for the glory of the Empire. In fact, preparations for "Operation Prodigal Son" have already been authorized, and the army is moving to attack the Mladorossi warlord state.

He was sitting there, simply listening as the entirety of the courtroom looked upon him, looking almost disgusted by what he had done. Deep inside him, he knew that his actions over the years, since the day he followed the Tsar across the frontlines of the West Russian War, were the right thing to do, and that if he could go back in time, he would do it all over again. The people of his country needed a saviour, and that saviour would be neither the totalitarian Tsar, nor the radical Bolsheviks, but what he had strived for: something in between. Unfortunately, just like many idealists, his dream was never accomplished - Russia was not ready yet.\n\nKazembek had lost touch with the courtroom as the trial continued, but his train of thought was interrupted when the judge loudly exclaimed his punishment: a lifetime in prison. He already knew that this was going to be his fate; after all, this was a kangaroo court, and the decision had almost certainly been taken behind the scenes. But he didn't care.\n\nAs the trial was adjourned and he was forced to exit the building, Alexander continued to support his position, shouting he was innocent to the spectators as he walked past them.

He was cold, but still oddly considerate of his compatriots and followers. He seemed to thoroughly think through every word he said and every move he made, yet he still was quite relaxed and calm even when speaking with the Emperor himself. From his first words, it was clear that Antipin was far from an ardent supporter of Vladimir, rejecting many different proposals for the integration of the Order into Vyatka, but there was still possibility for negotiations.\n\nVladimir, tired of having no results, aggressively asked the Grandmaster what he had to do to prove joining the Empire would be beneficial. As if he had been waiting for this question the entire time, Antipin replied.\n\nTo the south of both states, as different as they were, lied a common enemy: the Aryan Brotherhood, in the city of Perm, had committed crimes against the Russian people, and their ideas were, without a doubt, insane. According to the Grandmaster, ending their existence was the only way to prove the Vyatkans were worthy of God's blessing.\n\nVladimir carefully considered Mikhail's words.

A single question grew in his mind, pulsating and growing in mass, threatening to consume all other thoughts that he had. He knelt, bowed, and cried, with only fear of being discovered halting his throat and tongue from screaming.\n\nThen he became still. He looked around him. Beside his knees were the Bible, the word of his Lord. Next to it, laying in the dirt, was an old rifle. Daniil did not care enough to remember what type it was - just that it spat lead at his enemies. Perhaps there was no other way. Daniil could not see the point in living, and for his exit, he had planned something.\n\nThe great Satan would be in his palace in Vyatka.

In fact, there was one action he seemed to strongly oppose, and that was the integration of the Mladorossi movement.\n\nThe reunion of Berezniki was a bright moment for our government, but it seems the opposite was true for the Order.

Food was a luxury, and Vadim was lucky to even get through a single hour without being beaten. On this particular day, fortunately, only one or two armed guards were present. Vadim had wondered if this had anything to do with the distant explosions he had been hearing for the past few weeks.\n\nSuddenly, Vadim was blinded by a bright light to his left. When Vadim's eyes adjusted, he realized what caused the flash. The large, rusty metal doors to the factory floor, which had never been used much by the guards, had opened. Standing just outside the doors was a group of soldiers wearing uniforms that were unfamiliar to Vadim. Within seconds, the soldiers fanned out into the factory with their guns raised. Some of the soldiers began making their way up to the balconies towards the guards, who now had their hands in the air. It soon dawned on Vadim what was going on here. He was going to be free, and these men were to be his liberators. One of the soldiers, an officer, approached Vadim and the other slaves. After looking over the emaciated figures that stood before him, the officer gestured for the slaves to follow him. "Come, let's get you all out of here."\n\nNow freed of his chains, Vadim found himself aimlessly wandering the outside grounds of the factory. The sunlight felt good on his skin, and the fresh air was a welcome change from the stuffy, poorly ventilated factory floor. He looked around at all the soldiers, who were doing anything from interrogating prisoners to merily celebrating their apparent victory. From one of the windows a swastika banner was cut loose, and in its place a yellow banner with a black eagle was unfurled. Vadim sat on the ground, and closed his eyes.

More specifically, as we bring the areas of Idel-Ural under our control, ethnic groups such as the Bashkirs and the Tatars become citizens of the Empire again. The politicians of our country have now begun debating what their role should be.\n\nThe first to speak of this issue was leader of the Kadets, Roman Gul, who publicly pointed out that the Turkic people near the Volga are distinct in their history and culture. He then proclaimed that minorities should be equal in all regards, that being would be guaranteed by law, and that they should receive autonomy in the form of special territories and allowing local ethnic-based councils to form. With Gul having campaigned for minority rights often in the last years, these demands have not been a surprise.\n\nVasily Shulgin, figurehead of the conservative All-Russian National Union and involved in politics since the February Revolution, has responded in outrage. Claiming that granting autonomy to these minorities is a "betrayal to the nation", Shulgin has heavily campaigned against this, and it is widely believed that he and his party support gradual Russification through education, although the minorities will be considered as equals.\n\nSolzhenitsyn's NTS has remained more quiet in this debate, although many of its members have tried to push their solution as a viable alternative, and the one best for the interests of the country. They have been more tame in their policy, agreeing to treat the minorities as equals, and generally rejecting Russification, but declining general autonomy as well.

However, that role is unclear, and the reclamation of lands with a large Muslim population has made the greatest political movements question our current stance on the issue.\n\nAs always, Gul's Kadets have spearheaded the charge for respecting other religions and ensuring complete religious freedom by the monarchist government. This has obviously resulted in intense backlash from the more conservative and nationalist elements of society in Vyatka, and this has also been shown by the response of the Solidarists. The NTS was built on the principles of Christian principles and solidarity, and so Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's party has taken an approach to this issue more in line with the wishes of most Russian citizens. Their suggestion is allowing freedom of religion, but acknowledging the contribution of Eastern Orthodoxy to the country's history and teaching it in schools.\n\nAs for what the conservative All-Russian National Union has to say, its leader Vasily Shulgin has made several speeches in Vyatka about the importance of the Orthodox Church. A known anti-semite and upholder of "old guard" values, he supports defining Christianity as the state religion, and encouraging minorities to convert as they are part of the Russian nation.

Joined by two fellow soldiers, he saw the cause of the problem: a large detachment of the Royalist Guard of Syktyvkar. Even though Mikhail had initially appreciated the efforts of his government to use the local monarchists in the politically diverse region as a garrison, now that he was in the field, that did not seem like that good of a choice after all.\n\nWhat could it be now? Were the natives being mistreated again? Or was a local dispute or vendetta being solved using the authority the militia had? As the officer approached, he could see them having arrested a few dissidents, and torturing them. There were many questions he had to ask.\n\nAfter presenting himself, Mikhail inquired on these men. The reply was simple; they had been members of a socialist paramilitary force threatening the Tsarist authority in the city, and so they had to be arrested and interrogated. Mikhail was quick to answer: "All reports state that socialist insurgent presence in this neighborhood and nearby ones has been already dealt with by the Imperial Russian Army."

That day, as the Tsar and his generals plotted the final defeat of the last remnants of the Russian Liberation Army, and how to deal with the fallout of the conquest of Samara, but one highly important issue not quite related to war was on the table. As the cities held by the ROA fell, more and more high and low-ranking officers were being captured as prisoners of war.\n\nIn the war room, the generals who had brought up the issue made a new proposal, and fiercely supported it: the ROA officers, who share their sense of patriotism and anti-communism with Vyatka, could be pardoned, and be integrated into its army. This, they argued, would bring much-needed personnel, and a highly skilled one nonetheless. Of course, the Tsar quickly realized the reason why his generals were so supportive of this plan: back in the days of the West Russian War, the men who were now their prisoners of war had fought alongside them for the defeat of the communists and the glory of the motherland. The generals held sympathies to the ROA; despite its intense collaboration with the Germans, even more than the monarchist emigrés, they shared their goals for Russia.\n\nIt did not take long for the more liberal politicians part of the Tsar's government to try and shoot down this proposal. These men were fascists, and had still not abandoned collaborationism.

Such a ministry for Kazembek would likely have to be one where he can implement his ideas or at least influence the political status quo in Vyatka. However, many in the royalist government are reluctant to give a position to who they perceive as a traitor and a radical. Others see it as a necessary sacrifice in the race to reunify West Russia.\n\nDespite the wishes of many generals in his close circle of advisors, especially the "old guard", the Tsar actually conducting the talks in the city of Yurla is still uncertain. He understands Kazembek is a tough negotiator, and that he will not settle for a cabinet position that is effectively useless.

Since then, things had changed so much: new powers had risen, and the country was divided and torn apart. Despite that, there was one thing that persisted: the hatred of all Whites for the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe peculiar case of the territory of Berezniki was the matter at hand in the general meeting of the High Command with the Tsar. It was well-known to all of them that, under the leadership of radical Tsarist Alexander Kazembek, the fringes of the frontier had drifted further and he had brought them under his control, instead of managing it on behalf of the government in Vyatka. However, despite his absurd beliefs on a monarchy of the people, and his admiration for both socialism and fascism, Kazembek still maintained a form of loyalty to the throne. Thus, some believed he could be brought back into Vladimir's fold peacefully.\n\nThe High Command was divided by the issue. Many knew that an invasion of the rogue territory would only be bad for Vyatka, and it was preventable, and so seeking to negotiate with Kazembek was the best solution. Still, that did not stop the rest from advocating for justice against the traitor in the form of war. In the end, the decision was up to the Emperor."

The delegates had all had their chances to speak, to sway their fellows and the outcome of this historic event. They were united in only one thought: that they would be the ones to make Russia great.\n\nThe Conservatives under the guidance of the old Imperial bureaucrat Vasily Shulgin desired to see the Empire of old rise from the ashes, with a strong Tsar at its head. They promised the strength and stability of the old Empire, a return to the days of Russian Autocracy.\n\nThe Soldarists under the firebrand Alexsandr Solzhenitsyn offered a third way and a new era of anti-communist thought. Their leader made grand promises, of the new glories to be won in the name of the Russian people and their Tsar.\n\nFinally, the Constitutional Democrats under the leadership of Roman Gul promised a new future for all the peoples of the Empire, from Bashkira to the Far East, an Empire of the people. They promise an Empire that all the peoples of Holy Russia could take pride in.\n\nAs the end of the Congress drew near, the votes of the Russian people were tallied.

He had attended a rally in Vyatka the day after he turned nineteen, and he was immediately taken in by the fiery oratory on display. He believed, with all his heart, that the Solidarists were the best hope for the future of the Empire, not the stodgy old men who supported Shulgin, nor the effeminate weaklings who supported Gul. Russia would forge its own future, untainted by western ideas of "democracy" or the weakness of the old Empire.\n\nFinally, the results were announced, and nearly all in attendance were shocked by the outcome. The Solidarists had won.\n\nIn the crowd, Mikhail stood proudly with his fellows as their leader was sworn in as Prime Minister of the new Russian Empire.

A short, bookish man took to the podium to announce the results. "By the will of the Russian people, the All-Russian National Union shall form the first government of this new Empire," the small man's voice was strong as he spoke the words. To Vasily, the words were a balm on his very soul. To the sound of applause from the other delegates, he strode to the podium himself.\n\n"My fellow Russians, it will be my honor to form the first official government of the reborn Russian Empire. This is a day of great rejoicing for all the subjects of our great Emperor, from this day Russia will be restored to her past greatness and the hand of the Tsar shall bring stability to our fractured motherland," as he spoke he could feel some of his old fire return to him.

It flew off its hinges and slammed into the face of a man who was going for the door.\n\nThe squad poured into the cottage, rifles firing, killing two of the partisans before they could react. The rifle kicked heavily into his shoulder, his aim true, and the round entered the head of the partisan exiting the kitchen on the other side of the area. The kid's, for he looked no older than 17, head was thrown back as he joined the others on the floor.\n\nBefore the din of the battle had faded, the partisans were dead.

It will be hard, but the IRC has a plan.\n\nFinance and economic improvement reforms must be taken to boost our economy and give the Tsar's citizens healthy conditions in which to live. The Government will also have to decide on what type of economic policy should be taken. Improving our academic base will also be necessary to secure our future, and that means the universities will have to be funded. Our industry must also be rebuilt to provide the people with goods and the military with weapons.\n\nLastly, it has also been suggested that we open up to foreign capital.

No more small scale raids or warlord tactics, now our officers must be ready for modern warfare.\n\nSimilarly, while we have done much to professionalize our military, we still need better technologies if we want an advantage over the rival governments. Better guns and better tanks will let us storm through the enemy's line with ease.\n\nIf we stick to what we have or focus on new schools of thought, there will still be a lot to do to invest in our military. It will be expensive and costly to our new state, but it is necessary if we want to reunify Russia and move past the Urals and into Siberia.

The West Russian Sovereignty has asked for a consulate to be built in Washington. Constructing a consulate in Washington would facilitate trade between us which would be very good for business, but the Imperial Diplomatic Corps must also be doing this for another purpose. The Sovereignty undeniably needs recognition and foreign aid if it wants to expand its control to the rest of Russia.\n\nWhile it would increase trade and profits, giving them a consulate would basically show that we are recognizing the legitimacy of the West Russian Sovereignty as the regional government of West Russia. There is no doubt this would anger Germany and the other governments of Russia. It may be in our best interests to hold off from furthering our relations with the Russian governments for now.

After what felt like days waiting in silence, the door opened, and out came the King and his procession.\n\nNow was his moment to finally meet with another monarch as equals, but would the Swedish King really see him as royalty? Emperor Vladimir needed the legitimacy boost of this trade deal. Showing himself as equivalent to another King would finally depict him as the monarch of West Russia to the world stage.

He was done being looked down upon as a warlord.\n\nThe representatives and the King whispered to each other for a few moments. Eventually, the King spoke, not in Swedish, but Russian.

Per your instructions, we have temporarily forestalled judicial proceedingsi n the interest of efficiency.\n\nIt seems that our propaganda is taEmperor longer to take effect than expected among the lower tiers of our population -- many continue to resent our new state in private, and proclaim the emperor as a coward and a puppet. However, we have witnessed a marked reduction in the instances of anti-government posters placed on city walls and hidden places, no doubt thanks to our anti-sedition actions. No doubt, in time the memory of the rule of the extremist and communist states will die out, and be replaced by a true and heartfelt loyalty to the new empire.\n\nYours,\n\nBoris Symlosvsky\n\nChief of the Okhrana"

After all, is it not necessary for the father to discipline the child with a firm hand? Is it not right and proper for a herder to cull his herd? Can such things truly be called cruelty? It is only through hardship that strength can be achieved after all.\n\nTo his allies within the Solidarists the Prime Minister was a hero. The one man willing to do what's necessary to prepare the Empire for the foes it has yet to face, and the great and terrible hardships it has yet to overcome. But Solhenitsyn did not see himself that way either. Unlike many of the fanatics and fools who had infested Russia before the Imperial conquest, he was completely aware of his own mortality. He knew also that the history books were unlikely to be as kind as his party, but that didn't matter. For the moment Russia did not need to be good, or equal, or even honest. It needed to be strong. It was a dark world, and his nation's survival was far more important than its happiness.\n\nThe Prime Minister walked out onto the balcony of the capital, and stared out over the city. He could see the lights of the night-time work gangs in the distance, building the roads on which the armies of the Empire would march west when the time came. In narrow streets and crowded rooms alike, he knew the Okhrana was operating, weeding out the weak and the cowardly so that Russia could prosper. He breathed in the cold night air. His nation was strong again, and soon it would be whole."

It didn't rival the opulence of the last Tsar's audience chamber. Then again, that may have been the point. He gazed at the painting that hung over the fireplace. It depicted two ships in a storm, the wind howling as the crews pushed towards clearer skies. Shulgin liked it.\n\nThe door opened. Shulgin turned to see Feodor, the head of the estate's staff, entering the room, followed by the Tsar himself. The Tsar appeared relaxed for once. Instead of his royal uniform he wore a dress shirt and comfortable shoes. This was the first time the Prime Minister had seen his emperor outside of a royal function and he was surprised at how human he looked.\n\n"Announcing His Majesty, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias, Vladimir the Third" Feodor stepped aside, formally presenting the Tsar. Vladimir nodded at him.\n\n"Thank you Feodor." The Tsar's servant exited the room, leaving Shulgin alone with his emperor. The prime minister gave a polite bow.\n\n"Your majesty, thank you for receiving me today."\n\n"It is the duty of any monarch to be in close communication with his government. Would you like to sit?" He gestured to the stuffed chairs by the fireplace.\n\n"Thank you Your majesty." Shulgin sunk into the chair. He was resilient for his age but nine decades are not kind to anyone. The Tsar took a seat across from him. Shulgin studied his face. He was in his 50's but Shulgin still thought of him as a boy, a boy he had let down long ago when he made a mistake that cost the royal family their lives. But he was not a boy any more. The Tsar had reclaimed his legacy, and in his face Shulgin saw a chance for his own redemption.\n\n"I wanted to meet with you today to assure you that my government will work with Your Majesty in any way we can. I understand that the Emperor's role is an important one, and I hope I can be of help."\n\nVladimir cracked a warm smile. "Thank you mister Prime Minister. I'm very glad to hear you say that.""

Overhead, an electric ceiling fan lazily repeated its endless rotation. Somewhere in the distance, a typewriter clattered.\n\nIt was funny, he thought, how a single decision could alter the course of someone's life forever. Not long ago he had led the Kadets in the election. They had been the underdog, but towards the end the poll numbers had been promising. It had turned out not to matter. The Russian people had chosen tradition over progress, and elected Shulgin's conservatives to lead the government. Still, Roman had assumed as the head of one of the three main parties of the Empire, he would retain some influence in the halls of government. He had prepared himself for negotiations, advancing the Kadet's agenda through compromise and dealmaking and, if it came to it, a healthy amount of obstruction. How foolish he'd been!\n\nWhen he received his new assignment he'd been outraged. He was the head of a major party, one of Russia's loudest voices for freedom and democracy. Surely they didn't think he'd accept being reassigned to a token task force far from the centers of power. But it turned out they thought exactly that, and when faced with the choice of mandatory retirement or accepting, he'd packed his bags, swallowed his pride, and made his way to Syktyvkar.\n\nHe was not the only victim of "the reshuffling" as he called it. It was impossible to get a full count but he'd heard from dozens of contacts, now scattered across central Russia. A few of them had even wound up working alongside him. He still griped with Vasily Kuznetsov about what a raw deal they'd gotten during their lunch breaks.\n\nThe lights flickered and Roman snapped back to attention. He looked at the paperwork before him and sighed. Maybe he could still make a difference, even a small one. The natives of Komi were facing discrimination, and if he filed his report on time there was a chance someone who still had real power might do something about it. He grabbed a document and started reading."

I am addressing you tonight because I wish to speak to the people about the future of their empire. The new government, elected by the people to serve at my behest and led by Prime Minister Shulgin, has charted a new course for the empire. This course is an ambitious one. It will see Russia restored to the heights it once reached under my ancestors. It will see our nation reunited. It will see our brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and mothers and fathers who live in fear of fascist tyranny finally liberated and reunited with their families. These goals might seem out of reach, but they are achievable. We have come so far so quickly, we must not let our resolve falter now. No, now is the time for courage. Now is the time for the peoples of Russia to unite as one, as we have done so many times before, for the glory of Russia and to drive out the invaders!"\n\n**a pause**\n\n"I have full confidence in Prime Minister Shulgin and his government's abilities to achieve this, but every citizen of the empire must be willing to sacrifice for their motherland. If you are one of the proud, humble farmers whose crops feed your countrymen. If you are one of the diligent factory workers who builds the weapons that have secured our freedom. Whether you are a doctor, an engineer, or one of the mothers who labours all day to raise the next generation of Russians, we will all have a role to play. I will be doing my part by supporting the new government in my capacity as your Emperor. I have partnered with the Prime Minister, and in my short time working with him I have already found Mister Shulgin to be an extremely intelligent and compassionate man, with a strong connection to the common people. I believe he will deliver both the stability and the democracy that Russia has long lacked."\n\n**another pause**\n\n"I know that the last decades have not been easy on our nation. I would like to tell you that the hard times are over, but I cannot promise that they are. What I can promise is that we are at the beginning of the end. Russia will soon be reunited, so long as we do not lose our faith.""

At first Ven had been happy with the increased business the settlers brought him, but now that they were arriving faster and faster he wasn't so sure. It wasn't that he was uncomfortable around people of other cultures. He was an Udmurt who had decided to settle among the Bashkirs in Ufa. If anyone was comfortable living as a minority, it was him. No, what made Ven uncomfortable was the rate at which the Russians were coming to Bashkiria. He had always scoffed at the theories his more political friends told him about Russian conspiracies, dismissing them as paranoia and cultural insecurity, but now some of them were starting to seem more plausible. There was no way to prove it, but he couldn't believe that thousands of Russians would simultaneously decide to settle in a non-russian region of the empire. Sure, Ufa had been growing steadily even before reunification, but not enough to attract this much attention on its own. It couldn't be a coincidence that the city government was up for election next year, around the time the Russian population of the city would surpass the Bashkirs if current trends held. Ven expected they would.\n\nHe looked at the letter sitting on his desk. It was from his sister in Izhevsk, the unofficial capital of the Udmert people. It had been over two decades since he'd left Udmurtia, and in that time he had only returned to the region three times, once for a wedding and twice for funerals. He did not look like the Bashkirs or pray to the same god as most of them, but they had welcomed him with open arms. In Ufa it didn't matter if you were a Bashkir, an Udmurt, a Tatar or a Turk. All these groups and dozens more had lived in the Russian's shadow for so long, they were happy to share the sunlight. Now the Russians were back, for better or for worse. Sure they brought safety and prosperity to Bashkiria, but how long would it be until the street signs were in Russian? How long until he, who had lived there for twenty years, was looked at as an outsider again? No, he'd rather live among people who welcomed him as one of theirs, even if that meant leaving all of this behind. The time had come to pack his bags."

He carried himself well for a man of his years, but time had sapped him of his speed and it took more time than he would have liked to get to the microphone. The crowd didn't seem to notice. They continued to applaud him until he reached it, and persisted even as he pulled his speech from his pocket. He looked out into the audience. Even with his spectacles he couldn't distinguish the people in the crowd. They were a blur of excitement and color. Scattered among them were reporters from every major newspaper in the empire. Around the stage a series of microphones would broadcast the audio of the auditorium into the homes of listeners all across Russia. Towards the back of the room there were even three tv cameras capturing the event for Russia's fledgling tv stations. Shulgin understood the enormity of this moment. He could only hope his speech was adequate for it. He inhales, clears his throat, and begins.\n\n"Citizens of the Empire, subjects of Tsar Vladimir, tonight I will speak with you about a subject of great importance. Over thirty years ago a great mutilation was inflicted upon Russia. The Soviet Union was a godless, treacherous dictatorship, but its evil falters in comparison to the fascist tyranny of the Nazis. They stole our territory. They stole the lives of our loved ones. They stole our future as a nation and a people. We will not let this attack go unanswered. We will take back our future, and reclaim what is rightfully ours! The Bolsheviks could not defend Russia, but your Tsar will not rest until he has liberated his subjects and avenged the decades of oppression they have endured. The great mutilation will be healed, and Russia will be united and prosperous, from Saint petersburg to Vladivostok! People of the Empire, join me in this righteous struggle! Your god and your Tsar stand behind you! When the children of the motherland march as one, we are unstoppable. Russia shall be glorious once more!"\n\nShulgin continued to speak, but no one could hear his words over the cacophony of cheers that filled the auditorium."

He passed through his kitchen, grabbing some leftover stew from the previous night, and sat in front of the radio, as he had every night since Prime Minister Gul had been elected. Tonight, he awaited a speech from the Prime Minister, directly from the capitol.\n\nThe music that had been playing, some patriotic march or other, cut out and the anchor spoke: "Now, we go live to Vyatka where Prime Minister Gul is making a historic announcement."\n\n"Good evening, fellow citizens of Russia.

The horrors of the German advance into France, and the hell of the North African campaign were the crucible that forged him into the man he was today. In those days, even as the forces of Free France were pushed to the brink, he had endured much and felt in his heart a righteous anger against the Germans and their misbegotten allies. Now, as he observed green boys being molded by their instructors into the soldiers they needed to be, all he felt was a sort of melancholy.\n\nHe believed in the cause of Tsar Vladamir, to secure a future for the land of his ancestors, but at the same time he remembered the lives that had been destroyed by the wars in Russia and beyond. The men of the Foreign Legion that he led into battle, that he had ultimately failed, and even the men of the Empire who he served now. They were good men, all of them, but soon, after Russia had been secured, they would be thrown once again into the meat grinder against the German dogs who ruled over so much of Europe.\n\nNikolay was ready for that fight, in truth all of his life had molded him for just such a war, but the boys in the yard below him were not. He knew that, no matter how great their bravado, they were not ready to face the evils and depravity of the German menace. And yet, he would not allow that to stop them.

The oppressive stares that always seemed to follow him when he left his home were gone, and he felt for the first time that he could slow down and enjoy his walk to the butcher.\n\nDespite this feeling, he kept at his quickened pace until he reached the door of the shop. He was surprised to note that the thugs who usually lounged outside were absent, and for a moment he worried that they had finally decided to ransack the shop. As he entered he saw that nothing was out of place, the tension he felt drained from his shoulders and he stood to his full height. At the counter, his friend Isaak stood. "Ah, Yakov, how are you my friend?"\n\n"Better than I have been, Isaak, better than I have in a long time," he replied. The days since his vicious beating at the hands of the Russian Protective Corps had brought with them a slow change to his life and that of the wider Jewish population of Vyatka. More and more he felt free to walk the streets with a sense of peace. "I'll take my usual, I am having Rahel over for dinner tonight," the widow had long been a balm on his soul, and he felt it only fair to return the favor every once in a while. As Isaak started to ready his order, he felt the need to share his observations. "I see those RPC thugs aren't standing watch anymore."\n\n"Hm? Ah, them.

I know that Shulgin and the old guard were your first choice, and I am sure they would have done what they thought was best for Russia, but I would reassure you, my Tsar, I will not rest until the Empire is brought back to its old strength. However, by that same token, I will not allow the Empire to fall at the hands of the mistakes of the past. The old Empire fell because it was an unjust place that's mistakes brought about the anarchy that has plagued Russia for all these years. Those mistakes allowed the bolsheviks to oppress the peoples of Russia for decades, and I will not allow a repeat of those mistakes. Not when the fascists still control the heartland of old Russia.

Vladimir smiled, an ever more common occurrence in these days, and reflected on his life.\n\nHe found that he was closer than ever to answering those questions.
