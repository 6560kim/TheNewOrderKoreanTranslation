 ### Leader Desc ###
 POLITICS_TSAR_MIKHAIL_DESC:0 "미하일 안드레예비치 로마노프 왕자는 베르사유에서 태어나 스코틀랜드에서 자랐고 런던에서 공부했으며 2차 세계대전 동안에는 오스트레일리아에서 왕립 해군 소속으로 참전했습니다. 조국으로 돌아갈 수 있을지도 모른다는 실낱같은 희망이 나치가 승리를 거두면서 절대로 이룰 수 없는 꿈이 되어 버렸고, 독일은 서둘러 전쟁이 끝난 이후 모스코빈 국가판무관부를 수립했습니다. 결국 마히알 왕자는 오스트레일리아에서 평범한 시민으로 정착했고, 별로 주목밪지 않는 항공 기술자로 살아갔습니다.\n\n하얼빈에서 초대장이 날아오기 전까지는 말이죠.\n\n백계 러시아인 몇명과 가졌던 저녁 파티에서 시작한 조촐한 모임은 점차 커졌고 어느새 미하일은 군사적 모험과 파벌 싸움, 중상모략과 스텝 평원의 전투를 망라하는 거대한 소용돌이를 일으키는 인물이 되어 있었습니다. 뒤이어 그는 시베리아 도시 치타에서 아타만 세묘노프가 이끄는 백군 장군들에게 추대되어 왕관을 쓰기에 이르렀습니다. (그의 부모님이 귀천상혼을 했기 때문에 러시아 왕위를 주장할 권한이 없다는 사실은 완전히 무시되었습니다.) 새로 즉위한 차르 미하일 2세는 이제 동부의 한때 동맹이었던 적인 콘스탄틴 로자예프스키의 파시스트 군벌과 북부의 적군 군벌들, 남부의 일본 괴뢰정부들과 서부의 소비에트 독재자의 후계국가 사이에 끼어 있습니다. 말할 필요도 없이, 지금 처한 상황이 최선의 상태는 아닙니다. 하지만 그는 이 힘든 상황을 헤쳐나가기로 굳게 마음을 먹었으며, 가령 장군들이 그에게 뭔가 결심하도록 만든 것이 있다면 그것 뿐입니다."

 WCH_uneasy_figurhead_desc:0 "All hail Tsar Mikhail II! Emperor of all Russias and Imperious Autocrat by the Grace of God! These are among the shouts of praise that ring out from the capital at Chita for the Puppet Tsar. But the stark actuality of the situation is that the autocrat couldn't be more discontent - essentially kidnapped and forced to assume the throne amid bickering and aging White officer cliques, Mikhail wishes for little more than to see his home again, far away from Russia."
 WCH_sunset_of_white_chivalry:0 "Sunset of White Chivalry"
 WCH_sunset_of_white_chivalry_desc:0 "One of the most unfortunate realities of our situation is that currently our leadership consists of aging White generals who seem more at home reminiscing about the Civil War than leading a White Russia into the future. Worse still, the vast majority of our leaders seem to be slowly fading away. On top of that, we've had a hard time attracting any younger people to our cause - it's rumored that a great many of them are liberals, fundamentally opposed to our vision."

 WCH_the_true_heirs_of_harbin:0 "The True Heirs of Harbin"
 WCH_the_true_heirs_of_harbin_desc:0 "When the Reds overthrew Alexander Kerensky's unlawful government in the October Revolution, they forever shattered Russia and cast it into the throes of chaos. Our brave, holy few fought for years against the Bolsheviks, eventually being forced out of our last strongholds despite all efforts made. The last diehard holdouts, knowing that a return of the Tsarist system was all but inevitable, relocated to the Manchurian city of Harbin and formed a government-in-exile as well as an unlikely alliance with the Russian Fascist Party.\n\nWhen the Union began collapsing in the face of Nazi onslaught, we seized our chance, and with the fascists, moved to take our rightful place as heirs of Russia with Tsar Mikhail II at its head. But the fascists split our alliance and ground our advance to a halt! They claim to be the heirs of Harbin - but they are mere thugs posturing as statesmen. The leadership of Grigoriy Semyonov and his ever-loyal generals, heirs not just of the frigid Manchurian city but of Mother Russia, are clearly the true heirs of Harbin."

 WCH_civilian_investments:0 "The Tsar's Investments"
 WCH_civilian_investments_desc:0 "What is an empire without a military? And what is a military without a civilian industry to act as its support, producing anything and everything, from combat rations to supplies needed for logistical support and beyond. Our empire will eventually span the entirety of Russia, and right now we will need to ensure that a precedent is set for the establishment of the Tsar's investments into domestic, civilian industries - not just to support our ever-hungry military, of course, but to guarantee that our state will not repeat the mistakes of the past and ensure that every Russian - from the wealthiest residents of our glittering cities to the poorest of the villages - are taken care of and given the opportunity to earn luxury."

 WCH_mining_knowledge:0 "Siberian Resources"
 WCH_mining_knowledge_desc:0 "Siberia is so frequently portrayed as a vast, unsettled wilderness, covered in marshy swamps and frozen tundras. While this assessment isn't inherently false - it tends to obscure the material value of the land that we currently occupy. Its value isn't what's on top of the earth that we stand on - but instead what's underneath. The region has a large amount of resources that we can exploit, such as silver and copper, for both personal use and export.\n\nMost importantly, however, the paramount resource that any Siberian statelet could covet - coal. Coal is used to power our hungry factories, allowing them to consistently pump out the goods that we need to survive and thrive. We need to invest in the extraction of these resources for the benefit of our state and our economy."

 WCH_Military_investments:0 "The Generals' Addenda"
 WCH_Military_investments_desc:0 "What empire is complete without a well-funded military? Was it not the military, under the wise leadership of the Ataman Semyonov who orchestrated the reconquest and campaign that got our long-suffering movement as far as Chita? And how has the military been repaid? Budget cuts and excuses made by the faceless, civilian bureaucrats. Surely, the wise Tsar would know that this is no way to treat the fundamental organ of the state that brought him this far.\n\nAn addenda to the current budget, not yet formally approved by the civilian government, has been made by the generals and other high-ranking military figures to ensure that the general staff gets the money that they need for their soldiers. A simple meeting with the Tsar and gentle nudging in the right direction is all we need to ensure that Mikhail knows how important this addenda is."

 WCH_import_industrial_expertise:0 "Contact the Reform Bureaucrats"
 WCH_import_industrial_expertise_desc:0 "It's the sad truth that our industrial body is severely lacking in any sort of expertise or veterancy. Any technical or industrial experts that Chita once harboured were either killed in the decades of strife or fled, apparently anywhere but here. But without those well-versed in industrial management and development, how will we be able to ensure an effective and efficient development of our industry? Clearly, outside help is needed. Many of the White officials, despite residing in Chita, still have significant connections in Harbin and, by extension, Manchuria as a whole. It may be best for us to contact Manchuria's reform bureaucrats - those who had been put in charge of the miraculous industrialization of their state - to see if they have any resources or manpower to spare. Sure, there may be a cost in acquiring their expertise, but surely it's worth it."

 WCH_connecting_chita:0 "The Imperial Transport Commission"
 WCH_connecting_chita_desc:0 "Siberia is, to put it lightly, vast and ill-connected. For many of our soldiers, weeks-long marches are required to get from one place to another, and it's often worse for the peasantry living in the towns and villages within our domain. The economic inefficiencies caused by the logistical issues presented to our administration are simply unacceptable, especially in light of the conflicts that lay just beyond the horizon. We must found the Imperial Transport Commission, headed by the most experienced of our White émigré friends of course, which will be tasked with the connecting of all the towns and major villages within our statelet."

 WCH_industrial_machinery_deal:0 "Import Industrial Machinery"
 WCH_industrial_machinery_deal_desc:0 "Our industrial equipment is, to put it diplomatically, terrible. Other, more couth members of our administration have said even truer things about its state. The reality is that most of the equipment that we have in our factories is inherited from the Soviets, and almost all of it is decrepit at best and completely unusable at worst. But you can't make new machines without, well, working machines.\n\nAnd so, we must begin to search for ways to import industrial machinery, for the sole purpose of kick starting our own domestic and civilian sectors - perhaps our old friends in Manchuria can help out. This will not only ensure that we have an operable industrial economy going forward, but that our factories will be able to effectively churn out weaponry and supplies for our soldiers."

 WCH_examining_the_force:0 "The Officers' Requests"
 WCH_examining_the_force_desc:0 "Any good military needs a well-motivated officer corps. What better way to ensure their motivation, aside from the promise of a restored empire of course, than money? Unfortunately, the rumors circulating the lower echelons of our officers are true - their department is woefully underfunded, and those that they lead are worse off. Their request is not to line their own pockets - but to make sure that the men under their command have the best equipment possible.\n\nTheir request is not a small one, but it is certainly an important one. How can the Tsar's Finest claim to be just that when they're using rifles older than most of them? Thus, their request needs to be considered, their pleas included in the addenda, to ensure that our boys in white are best equipped to deal with our enemies."

 WCH_examine_our_artillery:0 "A Modern Artillery Corps"
 WCH_examine_our_artillery_desc:0 ""What's a division if it's unable to bring the fury of God Himself down upon our unholy enemies? What's the point of an army if we cannot play the organ of field guns and bring the fury of fire and brimstone upon those who stand in the way of the restoration of our empire?"\n\nMany of the younger, more idealistic officers, those who were born after the empire, often romanticize artillery barrages as if they were old men reminiscing about times long past. This practice is silly, but indicative - clearly, we need to bring our artillery corps up to present day. What few pieces we have are virtually antique. If we are to invest in a new artillery corps, complete with our own designs and organization, it may be expensive, but will certainly ensure that we have the best-equipped troops in Siberia!"

 WCH_new_infrastructure:0 "The Imperial Prospector Corps"
 WCH_new_infrastructure_desc:0 "More copper, more iron, more coal... more, more more! The current production quotas aren't nearly enough to keep up with the rapid - no, exponential - industrial growth that we're witnessing. Without the resources to support the massive increase of factories that we're looking at, well... perish the thought. Mikhail, at the behest of the brightest economists of Chita, has declared the formation of the Imperial Prospector Corps, an organization that will be dedicated to the searching out of mineral deposits within our borders and begin their exploitation. Progress comes at a cost, certainly, and the IPC is well aware of that. But in a place as wild as Siberia, Mother Nature can take a backseat to progress in order to ensure the prosperity of the Tsar's subjects."

 WCH_public_works_company:0 "The Imperial Development Company"
 WCH_public_works_company_desc:0 "In the darkest days of the anarchy that reigned in Siberia following the concrete establishment of our state centered in Chita, unemployment was rampant and many turned into transient workers, often without a home. While things are looking brighter now than they were then, our civilian sector is still suffering.\n\nThus, a number of our prominent economists have proposed founding an Imperial Development Company, a state-run corporation that is put in charge of and sponsors public works projects - organizing them to give people employment and further develop our crippled civilian industry. The reorganization of our civilian sector is paramount to ensure that our state has a functioning economy during the wars of reunification that are ahead."

 WCH_industrialization:0 "An Industrial Empire"
 WCH_industrialization_desc:0 "With no shortage of assistance from the Imperial Development Company and the Imperial Transport Commission, the industry of Chita, the heart of the White Movement, has gone from terminal to roaring in the matter of months, it seems. As our industry and output get stronger, we continue to construct more factories in an ever-increasing cycle of industrialization.\n\nBut we shouldn't stop here - this industrial growth is only a small step towards our goal - a fully industrialized state spanning from the Pacific to the Baltic. Nonetheless, the models for growth that we have constructed and tested in the area of Chita, and their general success, will act as examples for what we can do in the future. But for now: there is no rest for the brave worker."

 WCH_war_resources:0 "Strategic Resources Extraction"
 WCH_war_resources_desc:0 "While the industrial equipment that we received from Manchuria and abroad helped revive our civilian industry and allowed us to actually operate the factories that we currently possess, sadly, it's not enough for us to expand our resource extraction campaigns. The Imperial Development Company, as effective as it has been so far, seems to be a bottomless pit of demanding further resource allocation to ensure a continued development schedule, and one of the most pressing demands that their administration has come to us with is the implementation of further resource extraction. Thus, we must take on a domestic effort to improve our industrial equipment, as it has now become possible, so that we can take full advantage of the natural resources afforded to us by the bounty of Siberia!"

 WCH_reclamation_act:0 "The Reclamation Act"
 WCH_reclamation_act_desc:0 "Our small enclave has many things - an ever-dedicated officer corps, the best troops that can be conscripted, and factories that belch out refined, industrial goods day in and out. What we are lacking, however, is usable, arable land. Sadly, apart from the city of Chita and a few other mentionable towns and villages, most of the land that is controlled by the Emperor of All Russia and his administration is completely unusable.\n\nVast tracts of marshes and forests so thick that a man could barely pass through the trees. After a wise suggestion whispered into the ear of the Tsar himself, Mikhail II has declared the implementation of the Reclamation Act, a law that puts the Imperial Development Company in charge of clearing unusable land to transform it into tracts of earth that could be used for anything from low-yield farming to training grounds for our troops. Anything's better than the squalid backwaters that the IDC has been tasked with clearing."

 WCH_importing_rifles:0 "Import Japanese Surplus"
 WCH_importing_rifles_desc:0 "Our industry, fledgling as it may be, works day and night to produce the best equipment for our soldiers! Shining new guns, artillery pieces as tall as buildings, and shells to match!\n\nAt least, that's what we tell the Tsar. In truth, we're struggling to ensure that every battalion has a working field gun. We did what we could with what we had been given by the Japanese years ago and what we could salvage from old Soviet arsenals, but it's not enough. We need to look outside of our borders to locate the equipment that we need. To the south and east, across the mighty Argun, lies Manchukuo, the state that, in Harbin, harbored our movement for years. No government-in-exile spends any significant time in a single place without making significant connections. Surely, there's some Manchurian warehouse with Japanese guns, just begging to be shipped over to us?"

 WCH_artillery_imports:0 "Support Artillery Investments"
 WCH_artillery_imports_desc:0 "Our officers have excitedly drawn up their plans, and gotten them past the reluctant old guard that occupy the upper echelons of the white movement. A detailed budget has been hammered out, plans of development and organizational proposals all outlined in detail, pages of itemized and highly detailed programs. It only needs one more last rubber stamp - Tsar Mikhail II's.\n\nOf course, it's not really his rubber stamp any more than the empire is his. A brief conversation with the monarch, a five minute meeting, will be all that's required to ensure that our artillery gets the attention that it needs."

 WCH_specialist_training:0 "Specialist Training"
 WCH_specialist_training_desc:0 "Modern warfare is dominated by the specialist. That is, those who are trained in and hold expertise in areas that no ordinary soldier would have experience in. Right now, as our enemies crowd around us, the Tsar is assured that the reason that we will triumph over these pathetic fascists and godless communists is just this: specialist training.\n\nFor our soldiers, and for a newly created branch of specialists, training for independent chains of command, how to act behind enemy lines, and how to sabotage enemy positions will be worked into their daily regimens. This way, we can say that we will never, no matter what, be caught unprepared."

Amazar has had the luck to not only be included in the dozens of towns the railway passes through, but also just barely escape the grip of Rodzaevsky.\n\nAs both an important railway junction and the last camp to the east, we must take great care in protecting the town.

From swastikas to large banners and anti-Jewish propaganda, the RFP's former capital of Zeya was lousy with the party's symbolism. But that cannot not stand. Mikhail aptly suggested "toppling the pedestal", a process aimed at tearing down the RFP's propaganda and teaching the people that they no longer live under a reign of terror.

Rumor has it that Matkovsky's been searching for foreign recognition and aid, even going so far as to positioning himself as a moderate candidate in the Far East. This cannot be allowed to continue - for right now the demand for foreign aid means that even the smallest amount could be the tipping point in the battle between the Heirs of Harbin.

By promising amnesty to those who know the locations of these caches, we can have them bring us to them and dig them up - like how guilty murderers would bring the authorities to where they stashed bodies.

A number of mercenary companies were hired, and while we did best them in battle, they're now stuck in frigid Siberia, with no master and no money. This situation presents both a danger and an opportunity - leaving them unemployed could result in disaster, a full-on revolt of professional soldiers that we simply cannot afford at the moment.

The first step towards this would be to deal with the nearby Yakut Republic. The republic, apart from being an anti-monarchist state, controls incredibly valuable land, ripe for material exploitation. Securing their territory would go a long way to ensure a steady export of valuable minerals, as well as an additional place to use to increase our manpower. It's probably best if we attempt to approach them first, but if that fails, the troops should be ready at their borders to prepare a "hostile takeover" of sorts.

But the question has been raised about exactly how to go about exploiting the resources that we now control - the Yakuts were running their mines with minimal efficiency, mostly because of the lack of manpower. Luckily, we have something the Yakuts don't: access to urban centers with populations of the listless unemployed and political prisoners.

If we were to assemble a group of prominent Yakut leaders, both those who were a part of the republic and those who had been marginalized by it, we could offer them political autonomy in exchange for massive economic concessions and the recognition of Mikhail II as the Tsar.

One of the ways that has been suggested to do just that would be to construct fortifications along our western border.

However, the Ataman's most significant contributions to the White Movement were militaristic. He had organized the first White Army during our original foray back into Siberia, and had personally coordinated the entire Harbin Front, until the fascist traitors split it and disintegrated any hope we had of securing for ourselves the whole of Russia.

It is time to remind ourselves, and our peasants, of the fate of Yemelyan Pugachev, the rebellious Cossack who led his ill-fated rebellion against Catherine the Great in the 18th century. When Pugachev was defeated he was betrayed by his own Cossacks and was beheaded and dismembered. Perhaps the peasants should be reminded of his fate - any leaders of the revolting peasants will be captured and executed in their village square. No rebellion will be tolerated and all must adhere to the Tsar and God's Will, for the preacher in the north speaks of heresy and leads our people down the darkest of paths. However, sometimes force is what's necessary to remind the peasants of their duty and whose side they're on."

While the flames of his message will likely resound with our people for quite some time, now that he has been muzzled we can begin wiping the peasant's minds clean of Men's toxic message. Order must be restored and our authority extended permanently over the vast expanses of north-eastern Siberia. Our roaming inquisitorial squads must be given local bases of operations, and governmental administrators, bureaucrats, and political officers all must be deployed and redeployed throughout our territory.

The White officers, with Mikhail's tacit approval, have announced a week of joyous commemoration and the creation of an annual holiday to celebrate the first major step towards the unification of all Russia under the banner of our cause. Great military parades and the banners of Holy Russia have already been prepared and meticulously planned, and victory ceremonies have begun. The Tsar himself seemed present but notably distracted at a number of the meetings about these ceremonies, though, apparently only barely paying attention. Perhaps it is time that we sat down with him and discussed our future together."

However, there's no guarantee that, if we do not take serious action now, that we will control all of what we've worked so hard to get for long.\n\nThis is the start of something special - something that we've worked towards for a long time. But we shouldn't rest on our laurels now. There's lots of work to do - we need to extend our administration to even the most remote locations within our territory, deal with those who simply won't stop resisting our efforts of integration, and finally address the delicate political situation that's now being faced with the increasingly-aged "old guard" who had previously led the charge back into Russia."

However, this shouldn't stop us - if the Bolsheviks could do it, we can too.\n\nA comprehensive plan has been put forward by some of the more economically-minded members who followed us from Harbin.

Mikhail was born in France and spent his life just about everywhere but Russia. When he was kidnapped and brought to the city of Chita as a prisoner in all but name, he was forced to read speeches phonetically, frequently not even aware of what he was saying.

Every day, a native Russian business is consumed by the ever-expanding empire of the Zaibatsu, and concerns over the implications of this grow louder by the day.

 WCH.1.t:0 "The Unwilling King"
 WCH.1.desc:0 "'Tsar Mikhail got up from his lavishly decorated bed, washed his face and prepared for the bi-weekly meeting with his High Command. It was to take place in the "Grand Royal Palace", in reality nothing more than a glorified residence for him that had wasted more money than he was comfortable with.\n\nThe meeting began at noon. Mikhail was waiting for his closest allies in a rather expensive round table, and saw as they entered one by one. Almost everyone was older than him, yet it seemed that even the mere thought of a grand reclamation of Russia by the White Army, which would be led by themselves, filled them with energy and passion. Amidst them, a few younger men could be distinguished, usually descendants of emigrés or newer recruits. The Tsar had always trusted them; they were more logical, not tied as much to the distant past of the Empire and its values.\n\nAtaman Semyonov opened the meeting, delivering a speech on the latest developments. The fire of patriotism inside him was not out yet, that was clear. His hands were shaky as he slowly read the document out loud, and almost struggled to maintain balance. One by one, the generals stated their opinion and expressed their concerns. His Majesty stayed silent, exclaiming his approval in a monotonous voice every once in a while. His head was full of other, irrelevant thoughts - the wife he had left behind, his life in Australia, and more.\n\nEscorted by two Imperial Guards, Mikhail left for the streets of Chita once the meeting was finally adjourned. The bright snow covered almost everything, yet that had not stopped many of his "subjects", from children to old men, from getting out and enjoying life. After all, the neighborhoods were surprisingly safe, as long as you weren't a radical, and those were rare. Mikhail was proud of this beacon of stability that he had been chosen as the figurehead of - even if he didn't care much."
 WCH.1.a:0 "One cannot simply reject the throne."

 WCH.2.t:0 "The Death of the Ataman"
 WCH.2.desc:0 "'Most unfortunate news has arrived from Chita, the capital of Russian monarchism. Grigory Mikhaylovich Semyonov, well known as "the Ataman", has passed away from natural causes at the age of seventy one. A popular figure in Chita, and a valuable ally of Tsar Mikhail, he has departed this world to join his long gone friends and fellow patriots.\n\nGrigory Semyonov was born in 1890, in the region of Transbaikal. He became a distinguished Cossack soldier, fighting in the First World War before heading back to his homeland, where he raised troops and organized the first anti-Bolshevik rebellions. After months of struggle, he was able to seize Chita and the surrounding region with the help of the Czechoslovak Legion and his greatest allies, the Japanese. For the next few years, he became a famous as the ruler of Transbaikal, holding out against the Soviets even as the rest of the White movement crumbled. Some viewed him as a bandit, while others as an honorable soldier. However, fate works in a mysterious way, and Semyonov found himself in an oddly similar situation four decades after the Civil War. As an active member of the emigré communities in Harbin, he was one of the leaders of the emerging anti-Bolshevik front once it was established in the 50s with Japanese support. Eventually, he came to be the indisputable leader of the military clique that crowned Michael Andreevich as Tsar, and since then had been one of the most prominent personalities in Chita.\n\nAs per his wishes, the Ataman has been buried in his home village of Kuranzha. While it may be dangerously close to the frontier, merely a couple of miles far from the outposts of the socialist revolutionaries, many have visited the settlement to pay their respects, and some generals have done the same. Even His Majesty has issued a statement, expressing their condolences. Semyonov may have left behind a troubled legacy for some, but all of Chita recognizes him as a strong and respected leader."

 WCH.3.t:0 "An Offer from Chita"
 WCH.3.desc:0 "Today, a series of proposals and requests have reached our foreign office with a surprising address - the city of Chita, in Russia. Currently held by the Tsarists, the pro-monarchy legacy of the Harbin movement, the city and its administration has requested of us a large degree of industrial aid in the form of factory support and spare machinery. We could agree to deal with them, theoretically, in exchange for some future favor, or we could simply reject the warlord rabble."
 WCH.3.a:0 "Sure. Always nice to pad the favor wallet."
 WCH.3.b:0 "No, reject these Tsarists. We've done enough for them."

 WCH.4.t:0 "Manchurian Industrial Aid"
 WCH.4.desc:0 "A reply to our request has come through today, sent directly from the capital of Manchuria. The reply, dripping with formality barely contained the implications that the letter hid: the subsequent industrial aid that would be provided to the Tsarists in Chita would come at a cost, and the cost would be more than just money. The Manchurians and their Japanese masters frequently dealt in favors, something that our government has already accepted as a reality. On a long enough timeline, it seems likely that they will come knocking at our front door, asking to be repaid.\n\nHowever, in the meantime, it appears as if Manchuria, likely with the permission of the Japanese, have agreed to our proposal for industrial aid. This is a fantastic win for us - while it won't necessarily help us directly legitimize our government and provide political recognition, it will however allow us to bolster our petty industrial output and shore up our manufacturing. One of the best ways to ensure our victory over our rivals is to make sure that we can put more guns in our people's hands than they can, and that's just what we intend to do with this aid."
 WCH.4.a:0 "When can we expect the first shipment?"

 WCH.5.t:0 "Manchuria Refuses to Aid Us!"
 WCH.5.desc:0 "A simple, manila letter was received today, sent by the Manchurian foreign office. It contained their response to the request that we had made of them - to attain industrial aid from Manchuria, and by extension, the Japanese, in exchange for cash. The response was a simple, single-paged letter politely declining the opportunity, but thanking the Tsarists for bringing the offer forward. The letter was promptly burned after it was reported to those who needed to know.\n\nWith the offer for industrial aid declined by the Manchurians - likely at the hands of their Japanese masters, we can expect that any further industrial development will have to be done directly by us, instead of being reliant on foreign aid. While this is certainly a setback, it's not one that's unrecoverable. That being said, there are plenty of ways for us to fund this industrial development even without the Manchurian's help. Increased taxes, the use of the military for building, and the melding of private and governmental sectors will all be useful for just that. In the meantime, while our foriegn affairs office licks their wounds, we can go ahead and draw up a number of proposals for domestic industrial development."

The rest of Russia was going to hell, but as far as Kiril was concerned, this place was paradise on earth. Or at least it was, until Kiril spotted a pillar of black smoke rising from the tree line. Looking more closely, he thought he saw distant trees beginning to tumble down and flocks of birds frantically flying away. "What the hell?!" Kiril exclaimed, throwing down his rod as he ran off to investigate.\n\nWhen Kiril finally arrived at the scene, it was worse than he feared. Scores of workers in hardhats were in the process of chopping down trees by the dozens, and large construction vehicles were recklessly tearing up the ground. In the midst of all this, a foreman was directing the workers. Kiril clenched his fists as he angrily approached the foreman, unconcerned with the notion that he may be trespassing. The foreman, a grizzled, older man like Kiril, turned to face the strange man approaching him from the forest. "Who are you? What the hell do you want?"\n\n"I'm Kiril. I live back that way, and I want to know why you're tearing down my forest!" The foreman chuckled mockingly in response. "Your forest? This ain't your property, pal, we checked." Kiril was visibly unsatisfied with this answer. "This is where I come to hunt. I survive off this land! Who gave you the right to come and rip it all apart?!" The foreman sighed. "Look, we're with the Imperial Development Company. The government said we were to clear space for construction, so take it up with them and stop wasting my time!" The foreman turned away from Kiril, and he took this as his queue to leave. Kiril promptly retreated in a huff, and knew that he would be spending much of his night writing angry letters."

A few starving fascists we can handle no problem, but mercs? They live for this sort of thing."\n\nThat was unmistakably the voice of General Leonid Mustafin. Mikhail couldn't help but begin to worry about what they were meeting over. The general was speaking as though some kind of conflict was about to take place. Was war really coming so soon? The Tsar's thoughts began to race.\n\n"You worry too much, Leonid. A few greedy soldiers of fortune would be no match for our forces. I, for one, think that the time for deliberation is over. The fascists are divided and unprepared for a real war. Their pathetic rabble they have the nerve to call 'armies' will fall before us like wheat before the scythe!"\n\nMikhail felt his heart sink as he heard what sounded very much like his Army Chief of Staff Boris Shepunov. So his suspicions were correct after all, and his little realm was going to war. He couldn't help but think about all the ways this could end up very poorly for him.\n\n"That's all well and good, but we still have no plans for the occupation of these territories. How do you propose we-" General Vladimir Abramov halted his speech as he noticed the door to the room slowly creak open to reveal Tsar Mikhail. Consumed by the conversation, Mikhail had failed to notice he was getting too close to the door and accidentally pushed it open.

Virtually overnight, Tsarist troops had established a formidable presence, undergoing brazen exercises and visibly preparing for armed conflict.\n\nCorporal Fedorovich was no fool. He knew that these exercises were not for show, and that his unit would soon be going into battle. He found himself smoking more often than usual to try and calm his nerves, but all the cigarettes in the world couldn't keep his mind off the fact that he may not live to see the end of the month. Looking down at his pack as he shakily tried to pull another out, he heard footsteps drawing. Fedorovich raised his head, and saw his squad leader.\n\n"Good morning, corporal. Got a light?" Fedorovich silently obliged, and lit his superior's cigarette. The sergeant looked to the east as he took a drag, beyond the small creek that had substituted as a border marker and beyond the distant mountains. He gestured for Fedorovich to focus his gaze that way as well. "There, over that way. Beyond this encampment lies a land filled with hundreds of thousands of angry fascists with guns." Fedorovich remained silent as he looked into the distance. "It's going to be rough. They're going to throw everything they've got at us. I won't lie, a lot of us are going to die. There's no avoiding it, so make your peace while you can, and make sure you take as many fascists down with you as you can when the time comes." With that, the sergeant discarded his cigarette, gave it a quick stomp, and made his way back towards the rest of the men. Fedorovich appreciated the small talk, but his anxiety hadn't waned. Death lay in wait just over the horizon, and the corporal wasn't ready to face it. "

Rodzaevsky's throat was hoarse from all the shouting he had done on the way here, and by this point he had expended all the energy he had left to spend on loudly making his displeasure known. All that was left was a more subtle, smouldering rage. It was not nearly as audible, but his executioners could no doubt see it burning in his eyes.\n\n"Konstantin Rodzaevsky, do you have any last words?" As the lead executioner spoke, Rodzaevsky turned his attention away from the snow capped environs, and towards the men who now had their rifles trained on him. "Yes. I do." His voice was still noticeably battered from the enraged screaming, and Rodzaevsky could not raise it even if he wanted to. "Everything I did, I did for Russia. You can call me a monster, but soon the people will realize that only monsters have the strength to save this country. Perhaps if I had killed that decrepit bastard Semyonov and the rest of those forgotten relics back in Harbin when I had the chance, we'd find ourselves in a very different situation, yes?" The demagogue struggled out a pained, wheezing chuckle. "Go on then, make your weak Tsar proud and shoot me already."\n\nA flurry of rifle fire aptly punctuated Rodzaevsky's mocking final words. The former Fascist leader fell to his knees, and then landed face-first into the blood-stained snow. With that, Rodzaevsky's movement had concluded the very way it had conducted itself all these years: with unrestrained, bitter violence."

It was never safe to walk the streets of Zeya before the war, and she saw no reason why that would change now. Just a few minutes more, and her apartment would be in sight...\n\n"Excuse me, ma'am. Could I have a moment?" The voice made Sofiya stop dead in her tracks and emit an audible gasp. She broke out in a cold sweat. It was a soldier, no doubt, a civilian would never stop her on the street like that. She slowly turned around and her heart sank as her suspicions were confirmed. A young Tsarist soldier was standing there, awaiting an answer. The uniform and the gun slung over his shoulder had become synonymous with random beatings and harassment during her life under the previous fascist regime, and she mentally prepared herself for what was to come.\n\n"Apologies, madam, but I saw your bag and was wondering if you knew where I could find the grocer. This damn town is like a maze." Sofiya was still cautious, but the soldier did not seem very threatening in his tone of voice or otherwise. "O-of course, it's on the corner of the intersection just ahead. Just follow the sidewalk from where I came and you can't miss it." The soldier nodded his head in response. "Thank you, ma'am. Carry on." As the soldier departed, Sofiya let out of a sigh of relief and hurriedly continued towards her apartment. She couldn't help but think about that encounter.

Our valiant troops have successfully secured our control in Yakutsk, and now the vast region is under the protection of the Transbaikal Principality, and our noble Tsar. The question now is raised on what to do with the occupied territories. Yakutia is quite vast, and our army is regrettably too small to maintain strict control over all of it.\n\nTo try and save us from tearing our hair out trying to hold this godforsaken wasteland against potential dissenters from within, Tsar Mikhail has uncharacteristically broken his usual silence and approached us with a potential solution. He seems to think that compromise will ensure stability in the region, and it would be prudent to give a certain degree of autonomy to the people of Yakutsk on the grounds that they pledge their support to the Tsar.\n\nWould assembling a friendly Yakut government be a wise move, or would it be better to annex the territories directly into our principality?"

While we can attempt to balance our efforts, this approach would not be ideal if we wish to maximize the effectiveness of our funding.\n\nTsar Mikhail has voiced his preference for funding Loyalists of his realm. If we were to go down this route, our efforts to industrialize and expand Chita's infrastructure would go through much more easily and we would be able to enact our ambitious plans of clearing more space for construction projects. On the other hand, much-needed funding will have to be diverted from the military. In these desperate times, weakening the military could prove to be fatal.\n\nIvan Mikhailov, the Minister of Finance, has proposed an alternative idea that has proven to be quite popular with the general staff as well. He believes that civilian industry should not become our priority until after the region is united, and that all funding should be diverted to the military to create a fighting force capable of standing up to our neighbors when the inevitable conflict erupts. Although the civilian budget will suffer in the short term, a powerful army may be necessary to secure our position."

This time, Sablin decided to humor their taunting demands. "So, this is what it has come to. The war is lost and I'm to die in this dusty basement for my trouble. It's funny, I always thought I'd be executed by the NKVD, not some Tsarist relics." Sablin attempted to stand up straight and look his executioners in the eyes. It was harder than it looked, for the would-be revolutionary was greatly weakened from his time in captivity.\n\n"You Tsarist bastards think killing me is going to end the revolution? Have you learned nothing? The people of Russia will never accept a reactionary monarch. Soon enough, they'll remember all over again why the revolution happened, and when that day comes, another will rise in my place to avenge me and the rest of my comrades. Do your worst, but know that it's going to take a lot more than killing me to crush the revolutionary spirit of the people! This isn't over, not by a-" Without warning, the impatient Tsarist executioners opened fire and prematurely ended Sablin's defiant last speech.\n\nThe force of the rifle rounds caused Sablin to fall backwards against the wall. As his body slid down to the floor, the young revolutionary drew his last breath. Sablin's execution had finally brought the socialist movement in the Russian Far East to a tragic close, and symbolically heralded the ascendancy of the White movement."

What they found was all the more troubling.\n\nThe supplies weren't being stolen, they weren't arriving in the first place! As it turns out, teams of Tsarist troops have somehow slipped past the frontlines and have established themselves behind our forces in an effort to intercept and disrupt our supply lines.

Come, join us!" Mikhail turned back towards the balcony, away from Shepunov. In response, the old general approached the balcony and stood next to the Tsar. "Mikhail, what the hell is wrong with you? You've been so distant lately. You care to explain what's going on?" Shepunov's jovial demeanor had virtually evaporated. "Boris, what's going to happen with me, now that we've won?" Shepunov was silent for a moment. "You now rule the Far East, that's what's happened. Why do you think we're celebrating?"\n\n"I mean, what do you and your men plan to do with me?" When Shepunov heard this, he immediately turned his gaze away from the city and back towards the Tsar. "Ah, I see. Even after all we've accomplished, you want to go back to Australia, don't you?" Mikhail remained deafeningly silent. "Do you want to leave us or not? Speak!" Mikhail turned to Shepunov, who was now speaking in a kind of loud whisper. "No, I want to stay here." Shepunov's cheer returned to his face with an unsettling speed. "Good." He placed a hand on Mikhail's shoulder, and an insincere smile crept across his face. "Your destiny is here in Russia, my friend. Never forget that." Shepunov then took his hand off the Tsar's shoulder and returned to the party without so much as a word more.\n\nMikhail began to think, as he often did. In a way, Shepunov was right. His destiny was here, in Russia. Shepunov was also wrong, however. Mikhail was a Tsar, and a Tsar is meant to lead, not follow..."

The air in the room was oddly tense, with the only sounds being that of the owls outside, Ukhtomsky's fingers, and the grandfather clock in his office. Eventually the phone rang. The shrill, sudden noise made Ukhtomsky flinch a little. Without hesitation, he picked up the phone.\n\n"This is the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nikolay Ukhtomsky speaking."\n\n"Did you get our telegraph?" The speaker on the other end spoke fluent Russian, but their accent was still distinctly Japanese.\n\n"Yes, I did. I want to assure you that while the government in Zeya has changed, our intentions towards Japanese trade have not. The usual contacts will continue the deal as-is, but they will represent the new government. Do we have a deal?" There was a pause, and Ukhtomsky nervously gripped the phone more tightly.\n\n"We made a very specific contract with the previous government in Zeya. Does your government intend to honor this contract as well?"\n\n"Yes."\n\n"Very well, we have a deal." The speaker on the other end abruptly hung up, and the call was over almost as soon as it began.

I only did what I thought was necessary to bring strength and unity back to this broken nation, and at the very least, I would argue that my government was a far more legitimate entity than this sham of a trial!"\n\nMatkovsky almost immediately was showered with jeers from nearly everyone present at the trial. He attempted to dodge the vegetables being thrown at him by people in the gallery, but found it difficult with the guards restraining him. One of the prosecution, who almost entirely consisted of members of Chita's general staff, used this opportunity to lash out. "Mr. Matkovsky, as I'm sure you are aware, your father died bravely fighting with us against the Bolsheviks during the Civil War. And what has his son accomplished, standing here accused as a war criminal and a fascist tyrant? Mikhail Alekseevich, you are a disgrace to your father's legacy and a disgrace to our movement. I would go so far as to declare you are undeserving of wielding the very name of Matkovsky!" Matkovsky, who was still preoccupied with the objects being hurled his way from the gallery, scoffed at this accusation.\n\n"That's ridiculous! How dare you-" Before moods could flare any further, the judge slammed his gavel several times to regain control over the court. "Order! I will have order! Now, Mikhail Alekseevich, you are charged with over ten thousand counts of murder, and 3 counts of crimes against humanity. How do you plead?" The accused's answer did not shock anyone. "Not guilty!"

You are one of the wisest men I have ever known, and I hope you can find it in you to give your foolish son good council.\n\nAs you know, I spent much of my life in Australia after serving with the Fleet Air Arm. It was one of the happiest periods of my life, and regrettably the situation has changed for the worse. Several years ago, I got an invitation from a group of Russian emigres in Harbin to attend a banquet celebrating the legacy of the Romanov family. It seemed like a quaint affair, and an opportunity to celebrate my lineage. I expected to be back home in Australia before too long.\n\nOne thing led to another, and eventually I found myself having a crown placed atop my head in the city of Chita, deep in the Siberian wastes. As I write, I still remain in Russia many years after I left for Harbin, now Emperor of a realm I have no real interest in ruling. This place is horrible, father. These old Whites do not care about me or my well-being, they only care about using me to legitimize their barbaric wars and atrocities. Every time I attempt to give a monarch's council, they look at me as though I have three eyes. This land is cold and harsh, and I miss Australia every day. I feel a deep pain in my heart when I think of the wife I foolishly abandoned in favor of this hell.\n\nYou are the only one I can think of to turn to, father. I am locked inside a golden cage in a land that is foreign to me, and I do not know what to do. If nothing else, I can only ask that you forgive your son for being so stupid as to find himself in a situation such as this.""

What's done is done, and now I have no choice but to face the hell that I had unwittingly created for myself by coming to this place.\n\nI sincerely regret troubling my own father with my predicament, but understand that I have nobody else to turn to. This land is foreign and cruel. I have no friends, only scores of villainous men who pretend to respect me in public and no doubt laugh uncontrollably at me in private. I suppose I do not blame them either. I am a living, walking joke. They call me Tsar, but I know the truth. I'm a puppet, a figurehead. Even the King of England has more power over his domain than I do, and that is hardly exaggeration!\n\nI'm now convinced that Russia is one of the worst places on earth. The nights are long, the winters are longer, and the people of this land are irritable and violent. I have gained newfound respect for my forefathers, who somehow managed to keep this god-forsaken frozen hell under control. Our armies have seen a great many victories, but I cannot share their enthusiasm. How can I? They claim to be fighting on my behalf, but I have long since realized that this is not true. They do not fight for me, they fight for the idea I've been chosen to represent, and the men who hold me captive.\n\nI desperately want to leave, but I cannot.

Early sleeps turned into early mornings, and he hardly ever noticed the hugeness and the emptiness of the place. But as days turned into months that turned into years, things began to change. Late, sleepless, silent nights blended into lethargic, lonely days. More and more alcohol was brought into the palace, and everyone knew who was consuming it. He had bodyguards, sure, faceless children of emigres - but Mikhail knew he couldn't name a single one of them.\n\nOne of these long, sleepless nights, defined by Mikhail's wonders and regret, the powerless Tsar sat in a chair, overlooking a dark window. He couldn't see out of it - the streetlight outside was damaged, and the bright lights of the palace contrasted so deeply with the black night outside that Mikhail only saw his reflection. His mind wandered often, but tonight he could only think of one thing: his father. He had never endorsed Mikhail's visit to Harbin, even begging him not to go. Mikhail had attempted to write letters to his father, many times, with nearly a dozen letters in total written. And yet, he lamented, he had never received a single response.\n\nHe had once been close to his father, but his deafening silence had further crippled Mikhail. With a glass full of liquor in his hand, he wondered why his father refused to respond. Was it to punish Mikhail for leaving? Or perhaps, had he moved and not received the letters? A dreadful thought passed through the Tsar's mind: maybe his father didn't care to respond at all. He finished the brown liquid in a single belt - the first of many, he was sure. Mikhail missed his father. He missed his home, and his family. His mind shifted to one thing: another letter."

It had been artfully enclosed within the vanilla-colored envelope, the result of masterful practice and care by the Tsar. He sighed the deep, long sigh of a man preoccupied with the fate of his final letter. Gently taking it from his desk, he left his quarters to find his secretary: Fedor Orlov. "Mister Orlov...?" Mikhail asked quietly as he opened the door that led to his quarters. Orlov, sitting at his desk just outside, looked back, and stood. "I have... one more letter for my father. He hasn't responded to the others, but at this point, I feel like I needed one more."\n\nOrlov looked at the letter, and put his hands out to receive it. But as he did, meeting the Tsar's gaze, the tide of guilt overwhelmed his senses. The young man began to have tears well in his eyes. "What, what is it?" The Tsar asked. "Oh, my Tsar, I've done you a great injustice..." Orlov responded.\n\nOrlov proceeded to tell the Tsar his whole story: Shepunov had long been paying him to deliver the letters to himself instead of the post office, and on more than one occasion he had even witnessed the statesman burning Mikhail's letters. Upon hearing this, Mikhail felt something he had not felt in a long time: rage. "I see. Thank you..." Mikhail did not hand the letter to Orlov.

Mikhail turned to discover that the voice was that of his Minister of Finance, Ivan Mikhailov. "What a welcome surprise! Would you care to join me? I find a morning stroll tends to be better with company." Although Mikhail did not understand what his minister was doing here in his private residence, he wasn't about to turn down the opportunity to socialize.\n\nMinutes passed as though they were seconds while the two spoke, although It didn't take long for the subjects therein to get rather political. "I swear, there are some days when I would rather cast myself into Lake Baikal than continue to haggle with these White Army meatheads."\n\nMikhail gave a brief, nervous glance. "It could be worse, I suppose. Most days they don't even let me leave this house."\n\nMikhailov's pace slowed. "There are many things in this land that simply do not make sense, Your Majesty. The military holds more influence here than you could even begin to understand." The minister's pace finally slowed to a stop, and he gave a quick look around the premises that caused some concern for Mikhail. "Ah, I fear I may have said too much, my Tsar.

And you want to know what the worst part about it is? I can't leave, and no matter how hard I try, it's all in vain in the end."\n\nMikhailov was stunned. His spoon slipped from his hand, and landed back into his bowl with an ear-shattering clatter. "Y-your Majesty, I..."\n\n"Enough! I'm sick of pretending everything is fine, because it bloody well isn't. I can't even write letters to my family, did you know that?

It is a sad state of affairs when even Russia's holy sovereign is nothing more than a slave to the whims of his army. You are the Tsar, the Emperor of Russia. The military likes to pretend that this means nothing, but they have long forgotten their place. You have a god-given destiny to lead, and they have a destiny to follow in your wake.

As Boris Shepunov shouted for the Tsar's bodyguards to surrender, Volkogonov's mind drifted into dark places he would've rather avoided. Was his decision to side with Mikhail a wise one after all? What would happen if he tried to disarm his own superior with odds as hopeless as this?\n\nThe voice of his superior broke Volkogonov's introspection. "General Volkogonov, I want your men to move in. I've spent too long trying to haggle with these fools. Time to wrap this shitshow up." The general was caught like a deer in headlights. What would he say? Was this his moment? To betray the Tsar would be most dishonorable, but the alternative would surely spell his doom...\n\n"General? Have you not heard me? Get your men in gear!" Volkogonov gulped nervously. It was going to be now or never. No matter what decision he had made today, somebody was going to consider him a traitor. The only difference would be whether or not he'd survive after the fact.\n\n"Y-yes sir. All units, prepare to advance!" With that, the troops of the White Army descended upon the Tsar's residence. As he walked away from the line with the shame of it all weighing down his soul, Volkogonov could hear sporadic gunfire erupt."

They know what we're up to and they have the building surrounded! If only I hadn't accepted that bloody invitation, I wouldn't be in this mess to begin with!" Mikhail's hysterical shouting only caused an inescapable feedback loop of panic amongst the two. A sudden burst of small arms fire from outside interrupted their musings, followed in short order by an ear shattering explosion that shook the entire building. Mikhail let out a rather unflattering scream as a stray bullet shattered the window he was crouched by. The two men went prone to the floor, covering their heads as the symphony of gunfire reached its crescendo.\n\nAfter what felt like hours, the guns abruptly fell silent. The heavy breathing of both Mikhail and Mikhailov were now the only sound that remained. Mikhailov was the first to rise, peeking out the shattered window to see what had happened. No luck. It was getting dark, and the smoke emitted from the fighting made it hard for the old man to see.\n\n"What's happened? Did we win?" Mikhail asked nervously, still flat on the ground. The Tsar yelped as the door to his dining room was opened. The two men turned to see General Volkogonov, flanked by White Army soldiers.\n\n"Do not be alarmed, Your Majesty.

"Prince Nikita, your Highness! Allow me to be the first to welcome you and your family back to Russia."\n\nNikita gave a courteous smile and extended his hand to Shepunov. "Greetings, general. It's good to be back..." The prince, now flanked by his wife and two sons, Nikita and Alexander, tilted sideways to look past Shepunov and into the crowd behind him. "I say, where is my nephew? I would've liked to speak with him."\n\n"I apologize, your Highness, but His Imperial Majesty was feeling a bit under the weather today, and i'm afraid he was unable to be here.

Shepunov gestured for the royals to accompany him, and they obliged.\n\nDespite what the general had said, Prince Nikita found it rather odd that his nephew was not among those who had come to greet his arrival.

Vladimir was hand-picked by Boris Shepunov personally to head the White delegation to Tokyo. Although the general would never dare to question his superior's orders, there was one small hang up that he had with the idea: Abramov was a military man, and had no diplomatic experience whatsoever.\n\nHe wondered why Shepunov didn't just get the Foreign Ministry to handle it instead, but it was too late to do anything about it now. The Japanese were before him, expecting Abramov to be the face of the new Russian diplomatic mission. He knew the future of Russo-Japanese relations may hinge on the success or failure of this meeting.\n\n"In short, His Imperial Majesty wishes to look past any historical transgressions and promote a great renewal in Russo-Japanese relations. Rest assured, we approach as friends and equals." Abramov's statement sounded painfully rehearsed, and he hoped that fact was lost on the Japanese.\n\nHis Japanese counterpart turned to speak to one of his subordinates in a language the Russian delegation did not understand. The diplomat then turned back to Abramov with an unconvincing smile on his face. "Equals, you say? What an interesting perspective, to say the least. Do not worry, General, Japan is indeed open to strengthening relations. I sincerely hope that today's meeting shall be the first of many.

This was the first parade held since the reunification of the Far East, and Shepunov did not exactly hold high expectations for the display his soldiers were to put on. In the past, the White Army's troops were brigands in uniform, no better than the barbarous raiders he had seen several decades ago when he served under Ataman Semyonov.\n\nWhat he saw instead, was quite different. The troops marched in lockstep, their eyes focused upon their Tsar and their arms in salute. Their uniforms were impeccably well-maintained, and slung over their shoulders were the latest in small arms designs. Even an old White like Shepunov couldn't help but be impressed by the gallant figure the soldiers below had presented.\n\nAs the foot soldiers passed, and the famed Cossack riders came into view, Shepunov couldn't help but get emotional. After so many years, this was the army he had been trying to build. Not a ragtag collection of mounted raiders and militias, but a professional force ready to take on the world if it came to that.\n\n"Vladimir, I never thought I'd see the day when the White Army would resemble an actual military. This is simply incredible..." Shepunov's eyes were still on the riders as he spoke to General Abramov, who stood next to him.\n\nMikhail II, however, was the only man present who couldn't care less. What others saw as valiant warriors, he saw as the cold-blooded guards of his prison. The Tsar remained silent throughout the entire event, looking on in silent concern rather than admiration."

That is not to say, however, that things were any less strange.\n\nAs she made her way home for the day, Sofiya noticed a small group of people gathered around the sidewalk in front of her. Their attention appeared to be focused on something attached to the side of a building. Whatever it was, it had caused quite a stir. As she drew closer, she could hear the people mumbling amongst themselves. Finally, she was able to see what exactly they were looking at.\n\nAttached to the wall was a large propaganda poster, clearly meant to advertise service in the White Army. Front and center was an idealized depiction of a fierce-looking soldier charging a two-headed dragon with his rifle in hand. The dragon was clearly an evil creature, with one head colored red and the other a deep black. Wrapped in the beast's tail was a pole bearing the tattered tricolor of Russia. Captioned in bold letters were the words "Join the White Army, and deliver holy Russia from the clutches of radicalism!". The symbolism was not lost on anyone.\n\nSofiya could not help feeling twinges of concern. While this poster was fairly benign, similarly militaristic designs would not look entirely out of place in the previous regime.

It was all so tiresome.\n\nThe old general went for his alcohol. As the liquid graced his throat with a sting that had become all too familiar, Shepunov wondered what the Ataman would've thought about all this.

He should've known by now that victories usually raised more questions than they answered.\n\nDeep down, Shepunov missed those rough-and-tumble days in Chita, riding out with Semyonov and his cossacks on all sorts of daring escapades across the Siberian tundra. There at least, he could comfort himself with the fact that his enemies would face him head on. Nowadays, they took on a more sinister form; hidden in plain sight. The peace had made Shepunov complacent in a time when he needed to be more vigilant than ever.\n\nShepunov raised his glass for another sip, but this time no vodka was there to greet him.

His heart was pounding faster.\n\nThe cellar doors were thrown open with a harsh 'thunk', and suddenly orders were being shouted in the darkness of the cellar as at least half a dozen uniformed men marched into the room. The officer held deadly still as Shepunov's hounds sniffed around the room. He shut his eyes and held his breath, but before he knew it he felt a hand dragging him out of the corner and a bag go over his head.\n\nPavel was promptly pulled up the stairs and out into the sun. He savored the fleeting joy of feeling it on his skin again, but knew as he was loaded into a truck that he would not see it for a while. He was bound for prison and he knew it."

 WCH_superregional.10.desc:0 "It was a strange feeling. Mikhail was, at once, both a VIP in need of guarding and a prisoner awaiting exile as he was led in shackles towards the plane that would deliver him home. Not to Russia, his 'divine right', but to Australia. It was a chilly day, but not too cold. There was not a speck of snow on the ground, but the wind coming into the open hangar battered his face and tossed his hair. His escort was small, three lightly armed men and one of Shepunov's pencil-necked bureaucrats were there to guide him toward the small craft awaiting him.\n\n"Well then, Mr Andreevich," Stated the official as the group of five arrived at the steps leading up into the plane, "How do you feel?"\n\nMikhail moved to scratch the back of his neck, but instead simply tugged at the shackles he'd forgotten were there. "Great. Though, this is far from the procession I'm used to." He replied, the dry joke slipping out almost by reflex. One of the guards snorted, was promptly elbowed by his comrade, and deafening silence returned to the hangar.\n\n"Well, uh. Off you go, then." Returned the bureaucrat as the former Tsar's cuffs were undone. Mikhail headed up into the plane and settled into a cushioned seat. As he watched the crew prepare for the long journey, he tried to feel happy. He hadn't been able to all day, really. He should be able to, he has every right to be; he was going home, after all. But something nagged at him, a question ripping away any serenity he could find.\n\nHad he done enough? What would become of Russia? He had tried to push reforms, make it a better place, bring peace to the troubled land; and for sure, he had done some of that. But by the end, he had left it in the hands of Shepunov. The kidnapper. The traitor.\n\nSighing, Mikhail stared out the window and awaited his chariot to take him home."

 WCH_superregional.11.desc:0 ""Wake up, old man! It's time." the guard shouted as he unlocked the door to Ivan Mikhailov's cell. The prisoner lay unmoving in his bed, facing the wall of his cell. The door slid open with a metallic clatter that echoed through the walls of the prison, and the guards entered.\n\n"Hey! It's time, wake up!" No response. The lead guard got impatient and approached the still motionless Mikhailov. "HEY! GET UP!" he shouted, vigorously shaking Mikhailov. A look of worry overtook the guard as he backed away. The prisoner was ice cold.\n\nThe guard turned Mikhailov onto his back and put a finger on his neck to check his pulse. "What, what's wrong?" one of the guards asked from behind.\n\n"He... he's dead."\n\n"Was it suicide?"\n\n"I'm not sure, I don't think so."\n\nOne of the guards immediately ran off to find a medic, but his efforts were ultimately in vain. Ivan Mikhailov was dead, and nothing short of divine intervention would bring him back. An official autopsy conducted the next day determined that the former Minister of Finance had simply run out of time and passed away in his sleep, spared the humiliation of a public execution."

 WCH_superregional.12.desc:0 "The issue of the Zaibatsu is coming to a head. Over the past few weeks, complaints have reached our administration from various business owners across Russia. They are worried that the Japanese Zaibatsu are growing too powerful, and are swallowing every native Russian company in their path.\n\nAlthough he still sees benefit in cooperation with the Japanese, Regent Boris Shepunov shares some of these concerns. The expansion of the Zaibatsu shows a startling trend that has not gone unnoticed by our top economists, and it is argued that if nothing is done to curb their influence, the Japanese will soon have total control over our economy. This could obviously have disastrous consequences, and Shepunov is considering sending a diplomatic delegation to Tokyo to renegotiate the terms of our arrangement.\n\nOn the other hand, some of the White Army's command staff argue that our relationship with Japan is too important to risk over something like this, and are worried that attempting to renegotiate our deal would cause our important ties with Tokyo to sour.\n\nThe Regent eventually comes to a decision..."

 WCH_superregional.13.t:0 "A New Tsar"
 WCH_superregional.13.desc:0 "Prince Nikita Romanov knelt before the bishop, who held a crown in his hands. Today, Nikita was to be crowned as Tsar of all Russia, and he couldn't be more proud. When he arrived in Chita several years ago, Nikita never imagined he would be taking his nephew's place. The circumstances of Mikhail's removal troubled him, but the old prince was not going to let such lingering worries stand in the way of this moment.\n\nSlowly, carefully, Nikita reached out to take the crown. It was not the same used by the Tsars of old, but that mattered little. At the end of the day, the crown was merely a symbol of a concept far greater than material objects. The jewels could change, but the God-given authority they represented was eternal. Nikita gently placed the crown atop his head. From this moment onward, he was an emperor. The bishop went on to recite the next portion of the ceremony.\n\n"Most God fearing, absolute, and mighty Lord, Tsar of all the Russias, this visible and tangible adornment of thy head is an eloquent symbol that thou, as the head of the whole Russian people, art invisibly crowned by the King of kings, Christ, with a most ample blessing, seeing that He bestows upon thee entire authority over His people." The bishop then handed Nikita the rest of the crown jewels: a scepter and orb fit for a Tsar.\n\nFleeting doubts remained in the back of Nikita's mind. Would the military treat him the same way as his nephew? Only time would tell, but for now, Tsar Nikita I was the new face of the Russian monarchist movement. He brushed the worries aside. Russia needed a worthy Tsar now more than ever, and Nikita was more than eager to fulfill that role."

 WCH_superregional.14.desc:0 ""Dear Father,\n\nIt's probably been ages since you last heard from me personally. I apologize for not writing to you sooner, but know that it was not for lack of trying. You see, my life has become rather complicated as of late, and to lay the story out in its entirety would be a daunting task indeed. I write to you now not only because of the time that has passed, but also because you have likely seen the news by now and are confused beyond belief. If not, I will still try my best to explain the situation.\n\nAs I'm sure you are aware, I decided to stay in Australia after my service with the Fleet Air Arm. My life in the so-called land down under was relatively carefree, and I look back on those days with fondness. Sadly, it was not to last. Several years ago, I received an invitation by influential Russian emigres in Harbin to attend a banquet celebrating the legacy of our family. One thing led to another, and I found myself being crowned as the Tsar of All Russia in the frozen wastes of Siberia.\n\nDespite their generous show of goodwill, these old whites merely wanted to use me as a puppet to fulfill their dreams of domination over Russia and her people. I was kept as a prisoner in my own home, the days spent there becoming some of the darkest in my entire life. Despite the hopelessness of my situation, I had come to the conclusion that my arrival in Russia was a sign.\n\nNo matter the circumstance of my birth, a Romanov should never shy away in cowardice when his divinely-ordained realm needs him most. With the help of some like minded allies, I seized power from those corrupt White generals and became the Tsar I was always destined to be. I understand if this worries you, but know that while I did not choose this fate, may my soul be damned if I don't make the best of it. Our family's honor will be restored, I will make sure of that.""
