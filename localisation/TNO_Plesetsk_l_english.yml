 MIR_tukhachevskys_domain_desc:0 "During the retreat of the Front from its defeat in the West Russian War, Marshal Tukhachevsky rose into prominence as being one of the most capable generals of the war. Unfortunately, his rise coincided with another commander, Marshal Zhukov. To prevent rivalry from spreading among the ranks of the Front and retain its cohesion amid the harsh conditions of the Russian north, Grand Marshal Voroshilov devised a plan. He divided the Front into three and placed our marshal in the Plesetsk region: a spearhead pointed to the southern revisionists and traitors.\n\nBefore Tukhachevsky can begin his fortification efforts, he must account for his resources. He shall convene the officers and commissars, and divide work among the men as befits his plan. With the Red Napoleon at its helm, the Front shall know no defeat, and the Socialist Revolution shall continue its march towards an ever-brighter future."
 MIR_continue_fortifying_the_frontier_desc:0 "The region of Plesetsk is the shield of the Front. Bordering the revisionist warlords of the Komi and Vologda Republics, as well as the Finnish puppets in the buffer state of Onega, it will be the first line of defense in the case of an attack. To hold this strategic region, the Grand Marshal has appointed Marshal Tukhachevsky to secure and fortify Plesetsk, putting in the latter a task of exceptional gravity and trust.\n\nEager to prove to Voroshilov that his choice was not wrong, our Marshal has tasked the soldiers under his command to fortify the frontiers of the Front against illegitimate claimants to the mandate of the Union. The enemy shall not pass through where the Red Napoleon has tread. To that end, the troops will dig trenches, build bunkers and pillboxes, and erect tank traps to make the enemy pay for every single inch that they gain from the Front. Then, when the tide turns, Tukhachevsky shall lead the counterattack."
 MIR_finalize_aa_procurement_desc:0 "Though the Front lost the West Russian War in part due to revisionists and traitors working against the will of the Russian proletariat, no one cannot deny that the Front had done no less than catastrophic damage against the Nazi Reich. Afraid to face the combined will of the Russian worker again, the Germans have laid a bombing campaign against the former territories of the Union. Shattered and disunited, no one in Russia has means to defeat the bombing campaign, only to defend against it.\n\nFor a German plane to travel to Arkhangelsk, the most direct route takes them over the domain of Marshal Tukhachevsky. The Marshal, an ardent follower of socialism, shall not let the German bombers to bury the flames of the Revolution under a hail of shrapnel. He shall order the procurement of AA equipment finalized, as well as the construction and installation of them throughout his territory. No planes shall pass where the Red Napoleon stands."
 MIR_assemble_the_general_staff_desc:0 "Marshal Tukhachevsky may be the man who will save the Revolution from the sorry state it is in after the West Russian War, but he does not act alone. His general staff, who had served him since the beginning of the War, aids his decision-making using their accumulated experience. Now, too, the Marshal would need their aid. The lower ranks have finished construction, and the Anti-Air emplacements are in place, and now the high command must determine the course to pursue.\n\nThe General Staff shall assemble itself in Plesetsk. Their knowledge and expertise will help Tukhachevsky and the troops under his authority. They will plan the way forward for the Marshal to move forward and plan his offensives as well as defending actions. With his fellow workers watching his back, reminding him of his mistakes, the command of Tukhachevsky shall surely become invincible."
 MIR_the_road_to_vologda_desc:0 "To ensure a smooth process of fortification along the borders of Plesetsk, we will need more building materials to construct the bunkers, pillboxes, and fortresses that our plans currently demand. Fortunately, the State of Vologda, with whom we have an uneasy truce, may possess these goods, either from Moskowien or other states that trade within its borders. A diplomatic effort to convince the Vologdans to cooperate with their former comrades in the Front might worth a try.\n\nOur attempts to communicate with the State of Vologda will be two-fold: an emissary of peace requesting entry to its territory to trade for building materials in exchange for industrial goods made in the Front's factories and workshops. The next step would be the construction of roads leading into the State, to facilitate faster trading and closer relations, for now. Soon the Front will wash over these revisionists and avenge the betrayal of decades ago."
 MIR_import_supplemental_labor_desc:0 "For the task ahead of us, the number of hard work that each soldier must undergo will be hard and harsh. To relieve the burden of the average member of the rank-and-file in Tukhachevsky's domain, the Front has agreed to the importation of labor outside Plesetsk, or outside the Front itself. Whether they be from Komi, Vologda, or even the frozen gulags of Vorkuta, we will welcome all those who would work for the Front.\n\nTo accomplish this feat, we shall send our officers and commissars up and down West Russia, maybe even some to venture past Ukhta and into Central Siberia as well. These will look for laborers and workers to contract and bring back to Plesetsk. The infusion of a new workforce assembled from various parts of the former Union shall give us the ability to finish our construction projects in record time. Soon, this too will pass, and the workers of the Union and the world will no longer be bound by such concepts as "borders.""
 MIR_survey_the_resurgence_program_desc:0 "During the times of the Front's headlong charge into Moskowien in the Fifties, there was a plan to shield the Front from the nuclear wrath from Nazi Germany: the Resurgence Program. It called for the construction of a network of bunkers linked using underground railways to shelter humanity from the coming blast of nuclear fire. Coincidentally, the Front constructed a few of these bunkers in Plesetsk, artifacts of older age, with better construction techniques and materials. It may do us well to survey these and study their plans, even if we cannot replicate it flawlessly.\n\nOur engineers will enter the quiet and sedate rooms of these bunkers, as well as examining the quality of the underground rail. From their plans and the actual result, we shall learn to build more durable fortifications. These artifacts shall not remain so, for Socialism does not let any labor spent in blood, sweat, and tears go to waste."
 MIR_offer_our_thanks_desc:0 "The fortification work in Plesetsk has been going smoothly. The extra labor and material from outside the Front have helped it achieve rapid progress. The ground plans for the Resurgence Program has aided our efficiency in using the previously-mentioned two resources massively. With this steady development in mind, we can now perhaps stop and smell the roses for a moment. After all, isn't the world revolution to come a heaven for workers everywhere?\n\nWe shall offer our sincere thanks to the workers doing the hard labor in constructing these fortification efforts. For a time, in the middle of German bombing, they shall have extra rations, vodka, and cigarettes; luxury resources in Russia unable to afford simple pleasures. Their gratitude earned, we shall turn towards making the final push to finish the buildings as demanded by our plans. Soon the Front will reclaim its rightful place in this world - let this be a sign, a vision to the workers, of the revolution yet to come."
 MIR_final_fortification_initiative_desc:0 "The workers' gratitude is secure, and the work on the fortifications of Plesetsk almost finished. The time has come for Tukhachevsky to give the workforce of his domain, both civilian and military, the final push to finish the initiatives. Grand Marshal Voroshilov, watching from the Front's temporary capital in Arkhangelsk, would perhaps be more than a little surprised to see Tukhachevsky accomplish all his goals in such a short time.\n\nThe labor battalions of the Plesetsk command shall finish the remaining fortification units, be they bunkers, trenches, pillboxes, and anti-air emplacements. The workers, united in their struggle against capitalism and imperialism, shall finish the fight. After all of the fortification dues are done, we can finally look forward to matters northwards, especially in Arkhangelsk. The Marshal is old, and the Front must find a new successor soon, lest it tears itself apart. Clearly, given his work in Plesetsk, the Marshal shall choose Tukhachevsky."
 MIR_changing_horses_desc:0 "Marshal Tukhachevsky has honorably finished his tasking in the border regions of Plesetsk. Here, he was to construct fortifications to prevent the enemy from reaching the heart of the Front. He has succeeded with flying colors, not only accomplishing his mission but also giving the Front access to resources in Vologda and beyond. His architects and planners have found and analyzed the Resurgence Program, providing the entirety of the Front the ability to build better bunkers at lower costs.\n\nHis aim now changes. In addition to following the Grand Marshal's orders, he shall now bid to succeed him. There has been a rift growing between Tukhachevsky and the rest of the Front. The Grand Marshal and his protege, as well as his old rival in Marshal Zhukov of Ukhta, have embraced ideas that contradict Tukhachevsky's interpretation of Marxism. Only the Red Napoleon, with all his genius and might, can restore the Union, and following that, bringing the Revolution to the rest of the globe."
