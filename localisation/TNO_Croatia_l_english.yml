 #Ideas
 CRO_the_sham_kingdom:0 "The Sham Kingdom"
 CRO_the_sham_kingdom_desc:0 ""
 CRO_the_partisan_problem:0 "The Partisan Problem"
 CRO_the_partisan_problem_desc:0 "Since 1941, partisans have constantly harangued the Balkan governments set up by the victorious Axis powers. However, they refuse to die, and Tito continues to lead terrorists in a campaign against the legitimate government."
 CRO_serb_flight:0 "Serb Flight"
 CRO_serb_flight_desc:0 "After years of ethnic cleansing committed by the Ustaše government of the Poglavnik, Serbs have either been annihilated or forced into internal displacement in most parts of the nation.\n\nHowever, the few remaining Serbs have taken advantage of the government's inability to act and have decided to flee, leaving many villages abandoned and the economy ruined."
 CRO_italian_supervision:0 "Italian Supervision"    
 CRO_italian_supervision_desc:0 "After the Poglavnik's death, the King Tomislav was forced to accept Italian supervision in an effort to end the brutality of Ustaše rule, as Ciano disapproved of it. As such, Croatia is now being closely watched by the Royal Army and the PNF itself, with Tomislav being little more than a puppet."
 CRO_legacy_of_the_ustase:0 "Legacy of the Ustaše"
 CRO_legacy_of_the_ustase_desc:0 "The Ustaše never went away. They remain as a powerful political movement, and even worse, they feel betrayed by their Italian masters. It is probable that they are working with our rival, Germany, to work against us."

 CRO_bosnian_autonomy:0 "Bosnian Autonomy"
 CRO_bosnian_autonomy_desc:0 ""

 CRO_the_sham_kingdom: "The Sham Kingdom"
 CRO_the_sham_kingdom_desc: "While forced behind Italian heels, many within Croatia; both the new king as well as the people, had hoped for some advancement from their benefactors. Instead, Croatia exists as nothing but a plaything entirely beholden to the whims of Rome, while receiving none of the benefits. We reside in a nation with a reluctant king, an embarrassing legitimacy, and an irrelevant autonomy. Something must be done to rectify this one sided relationship."

 #Leader descriptions
 POLITICS_TOMISLAV_II_DESC:0 "Tomislav II, previously known as Aimone Roberto Margherita Maria Giuseppe Torino di Savoia-Aosta, was inaugurated against his will as the new Croatian king while the throes of WWII were still shaking Europe. Once a Prince of Italy's royal house, Aimone found himself at the head of a nation which he had no love for - he didn't speak a word of Croatian nor had he even ever been there, as he was picked simply because of his noble blood. Upon being forced into kingship, Aimone soon found that his title was nothing but a farce, a thin disguise for the iron fisted rule of Ante Pavelić, commander of the brutal Ustaše fascist movement. \n\nThe creation of Atlantropa brought further woe upon Croatia, already plagued by the ruthless ethnic and religious violence wrought on the population by the Ustaše, as the destruction of what little was left of the nation's fishing and naval industry caused the collapse of its already weak economy. The only thing resembling good news was that with Pavelić's death in 1959, Italy, now with Ciano at the helm, seized the chance to actively oppose the Ustaše, forcing them underground. \n\nNow, power stays firmly in the hands of a cadre of Italian advisors and military officers, with King Tomislav II being an unwilling farce of king ruling over a broken nation that hates him and the foreign oppression he represents. With dissent in the country reaching unbearable levels, Croatia might very soon reveal itself to be a powder keg sitting right next on Italy's borders - and the fuse is getting shorter by the day."
