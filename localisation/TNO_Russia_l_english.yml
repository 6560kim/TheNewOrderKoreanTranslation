 raiding.10.t:0 "보물!"
 raiding.10.d:0 "우리 병사들이 적을 박살 내고 쓸 수 있는 거라면 죄다 뿌리째 뽑아 가져갔습니다. 폭력이 만들어낸 혼란과 흥분 속에서 우리 병사 한 명이 잠긴 창고 문을 박살 냈습니다. 그 병사가 본 것은 꿈도 꾸지 못할 정도로 엄청난 보물들이었습니다! 금, 귀금속, 동상, 그리고 과거 러시아가 남긴 다른 것들. 이 유산들을 챙긴다는 것은 엄청난 부, 위신, 그리고 위대한 시대에 대한 향수를 의미합니다. 이번 교전은 폭력적이고 야만적이었습니다. 하지만 이 보물들은 위대한 시대가 우리 사람들에게 올 것이라는 신호일 겁니다."
 raiding.10.a:0 "과거의 유산들이군..."
 
 raiding.11.t:0 "과거의 기계들"
 raiding.11.d:0 "적을 분쇄한 후, 우리 병사들이 적의 창고와 병기창으로 돌진해 쓸 수 있는 것들은 챙기고 가져갈 수 없는 것들은 파괴했습니다. 우리 병사 한 무리가 엄청난 산업 장비가 보관된 창고를 우연히 발견했습니다. 그 기계들을 우리 공장으로 가져가 생산 설비에 설치하는 게 좋아 보입니다. 한 번에 기계 한 대씩. 우리는 어느 날 러시아를 재건할 수 있을 것입니다. 우리는 러시아가 과거 가졌던 영광을 되찾을 수 있을 것입니다."

 raiding.12.t:0 "과거의 기억들"
 raiding.12.d:0 "우리 병사들이 적의 황량한 군사 기지로 몰려들었습니다. 그 군사 기지는 시체로 뒤덮여 있었습니다. 우리 병사들은 문으로 뛰어들고, 전시와 같은 흥분 속에서 소리치고 울부짖으며, 패잔병들에게 무분별하게 총을 쐈습니다. 우리 병사들은 좁은 통로와 폭탄 맞은 방을 지나쳤습니다. 이들은 보급품, 무기, 장비를 찾아 캐비닛과 보관함을 박살 냈습니다. 그러다가 창고에 뛰어든 한 부대가 구 러시아의 유산을 찾았습니다. 병사들은 무기를 내려놓고 사진, 비디오 필름, 그 외 물건들을 긁어모으기 시작했습니다. 오늘 아침 그 물품들을 받았습니다. 우리는 무정부 상태 이전 러시아가 남긴 필름, 책, 그림에서 어마어마한 부를 찾았습니다. 그 물자들은 과거의 영광과 현재의 굴욕을 떠올리게 만드는 손짓이었습니다."
 raiding.12.a:0 "언젠가는 러시아가 이걸로 다시 한 번 통일을 이룰지도 몰라..."
 
 raiding.13.t:0 "음식 도난"
 raiding.13.d:0 "오늘 아침 도적과 범죄자들이 우리 식량 보급품을 약탈한 것을 발견했습니다. 최소 세 곳에서 곡물, 고기, 소금, 통조림을 보관하고 있던 창고가 약탈당했습니다. 남은 것은 엎어진 보릿자루 몇 개와 먹을 수 없게 된 고기 통조림 몇 개뿐이었습니다. 아이들은 배를 곯으며 잠자리에 들고 농부들은 사람들을 먹여 살리기 위해 분투합니다. 몇 주만 지나면 사람들이 먹을 것을 얻기 위해 서로에게 총을 겨눌 겁니다. 뭔가 해야 합니다."
 raiding.13.a:0 "이번 달은 배급량이 반 토막 나겠군"
 
 raiding.14.t:0 "도살당한 주둔군"
 raiding.14.d:0 "오늘 아침은 죽음과 패배의 소식과 함께 시작되었습니다. 도적 약탈자들이 우리 막사를 짓밟았습니다. 우리 주둔군은 소름 끼치고 끔찍한 방법으로 살해당해 흙밭에 버려졌습니다. 벽은 피와 뇌 조각으로 범벅이 되었고 병사 침실에서는 빛나는 연기가 피어오릅니다. 습격자들의 순수히 악의와 잔인함만으로 이런 짓을 벌였습니다. 우리 인력은 큰 피해를 보았습니다. 놈들은 어딘가로 사라졌습니다. 국경 지대에 부는 바람이 손짓합니다. [Root.GetName] 사람들은 공포 속에서 고개를 숙입니다. 최대한 빨리 그 야만인들에 대항해 뭐라도 해야 합니다."
 raiding.14.a:0 "전사자를 매장하고, 유족들에게 알리도록..."
 
 raiding.15.t:0 "손상된 기계"
 raiding.15.d:0 "우리 영토에 벌어진 습격에 대해 최신 보고가 올라왔습니다. 다행히도 우리 민간인 대부분은 무사했습니다. 하지만 산업 생산은 그렇지 못했습니다. 공장 장비들이 약탈당했고 많은 시설이 화재로 소실되었습니다. 산업 발전이 크게 후퇴했습니다. 현재 우리 생산량을 효과적으로 증대시킬 방법은 없습니다. 하지만 우리 사람들을 지킬 수는 있습니다. 기계는 잃어도 되찾을 수 있지만, 생명은 그렇지 못하니까요."
 raiding.15.a:0 "개새끼들!"
 
 raiding.16.t:0 "약탈당한 병기창"
 raiding.16.d:0 "장군들이 우리가 소유한 무기고 몇 곳이 도적들에게 약탈당했다고 보고했습니다. 보고에 따르면 소총과 탄약이 사라졌습니다. 몇몇 무기고는 모든 물품을 도난당했습니다. 놈들은 하룻밤 사이에 사라졌습니다. 놈들은 우리 국경 지대를 오래전에 통과한 것 같습니다. 우리 창고는 비었습니다. 놈들을 막을 무기가 갈수록 부족해질 것입니다. 뭔가 해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 곧 우리 목숨도 도둑맞을 것입니다."
 raiding.16.a:0 "이건 놈들 기운만 북돋아 줄 뿐이야..."
 
 raiding.17.t:0 "파괴된 마을들"
 raiding.17.d:0 "폐허가 된 국경 마을에서 보고를 받았습니다. 우리 사람들이 도륙당하고 우리 산업이 파괴되었습니다. 국경을 너머 습격해온 도적들은 분명 강력하며 야만적인 놈들이었을겁니다. 그렇지 않는다면 우리 방위군을 몰살시키고 우리 사람들을 두들겨팼을리가 없습니다. 집, 마을회관, 작업장에서 백여구의 시체가 발견되었습니다. 생존자들은 습격에 대해 말하며 공포에 몸을 떨었습니다. 도적의 공격을 효과적으로 막을 수 없게 되었습니다. 이 분쟁 지역을 통치하는 능력에 심각한 피해가 갔습니다. 지금이 우리가 제일 나약해진 순간입니다. 분노를 실어 반격하려면 먼저 무슨 수를 써서라도 살아남아 회복해야 합니다."

 #West Russian Wonders
 RUSwonder.1.t:0 "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Captured!"
 RUSwonder.1.desc:0 "We have acquired the Gorky tank factory, the largest producer of armored vehicles in West Russia. This factory was a vital part of Soviet industrial production and saw heavy usage during the West Russian War. In the aftermath of the WRRF's collapse, it fell into the hands of Nikolai Averin and his divisions of bandits, who used the factory to pump out tanks for their raids on Reichskommissariat Moskowien. An ignoble fate, for such an important piece of military infrastructure! Tanks are rare among the warlords of Russia, making anyone who can produce them a force to reckon with and making the factory a highly sought after prize.\n\nNow that it belongs to us, we can utilize Gorki's tank factory for a higher purpose than stealing scraps from the Germans. Regaining the capacity to produce tanks will be another step towards achieving the military capabilities of a full-fledged nation, and another step towards declaring a final victory in West Russia."
 RUSwonder.1.a:0 "The power of modern warfare, unleashed."

 RUSwonder.2.t:0 "Syktyvkar Arsenal Captured!"
 RUSwonder.2.desc:0 "We have secured the arsenal in Syktyvkar, a major stockpile of military weaponry that could prove decisive in securing victory in West Russia. Previously in the hands of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, it came into the possession of the fledgeling Komi Republic when the WRRF fled Syktyvkar. Komi used the arsenal to maintain order inside of its notoriously unstable capital and establish itself as a regional power, but, even with full access to it, was unable to prevent its loss. The arsenal contains firearms, explosives, tanks, and chemical weaponry, a fearsome collection for any would-be conqueror.\n\nHaving taken it, we are at a hefty advantage, proudly wielding the weapons that will bring us victory in West Russia. In the perpetual resource shortage of the post-Soviet order, every gun counts. Our control over the arsenal will afford us all the equipment we need to impose our authority over the region."
 RUSwonder.2.a:0 "Locked and loaded."

 RUSwonder.3.t:0 "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.3.desc:0 "After conquering the city of Izhevsk, we have secured our control over the Izhevsk Mechanical Plant, the single greatest center of arms production in West Russia. Izhevsk has long been used to pump out enormous quantities of pistols, rifles, and other small arms. After the collapse of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, Izhevsk and its factory became the property of Vladimir Romanov, the purported successor to Russia's late Tsar, who used it to build up his reactionary forces in a play for regional domination.\n\nNow that the plant is solidly ours, we can use it for the same purpose. In the Great Patriotic War and West Russian War, it was one of the primary producers of weapons for a huge number of soldiers. We can ensure that our armies are armed with new, modern firearms while our opponents struggle to assemble outdated arsenals."

 RUSwonder.4.t:0 "Krasnoye Sormovo Factory Lost!"
 RUSwonder.4.desc:0 "We fought long and hard, but we have lost control of the Gorky tank factory, a major blow to our vehicle production capacity. The tank factory, formerly used to great effect by the West Russian Revolutionary Front against the Germans, has long been a strategic lynchpin in the region, since it is one of the only industrial centers capable of creating heavy armor. Tanks are disproportionately powerful against the relatively lightly armed armies that make up most of West Russia's military forces; any warlord with them in possession can expect to be taken very seriously.\n\nThe factory gave us an undeniable edge in firepower, and will likely be used for very similar purposes by its new owners. We are far from doomed, but we should expect a larger quantity of tanks and armored vehicles in the near future and prepare accordingly."
 RUSwonder.4.a:0 "A troubling development."

 RUSwonder.5.t:0 "Syktyvkar Arsenal Lost!"
 RUSwonder.5.desc:0 "Our soldiers defended it in running street battles throughout Syktyvkar, but the massive arsenal stored in that city is no longer ours. Belonging initially to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the arsenal was abandoned when the Red Army fled the city in the late 1950's and used by the Komi Republic to maintain order and equip its military. It includes a great quantity of firearms, ammunition, grenades, and, perhaps most interestingly to the less discerning warlord, chemical weapons.\n\nWe have much to fear now that the arsenal has left our control. We have naturally acted according to the laws of warfare, but that same guarantee cannot be said of our opponents; it is entirely possible that the arsenal's new stewards will employ chemical weapons against us. This, combined with the new deficit in weapon quantity caused by the turnover, means that the balance of power in West Russia has shifted by a noticeable amount."
 RUSwonder.5.a:0 "We are outgunned, but not yet outmatched."

 RUSwonder.6.t:0 "Izhevsk Mechanical Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.6.desc:0 "With the loss of the city of Izhevsk, and the mighty Izhevsk Mechanical Plant with it, we may be in dire straits. The plant, the largest small arms factory in West Russia, is a prize coveted by any warlord worth his salt. Its usage dates back to the West Russian Revolutionary Front, the only force in living memory able to produce weapons on a quantity capable of challenging Germany. The plant went from their control to ours, and now lies in the hands of our enemies.\n\nNothing is certain in the chaotic battlefields of West Russia, but we can surmise that this has been a significant loss to our forces. Although we will not feel the loss immediately, the decrease in our productive capacity is sure to have negative effects on our ability to equip our troops in the future. Shortages are likely, and modern production techniques will once again become a luxury for our forces. We are far from finished, but this is a concerning development nevertheless."
 RUSwonder.6.a:0 "We will make up for their guns with our mettle."
 
 RUSwonder.7.t:0 "Vorkuta Gulags Caputured!"
 RUSwonder.7.desc:0 "As our men sweep over the arctic plains, the infamously dreadful Vorkuta Gulags have come under our administration. The dark complex of watch-towers, gloomy barracks, and labor camps strike a trembling fear in these icy wastes; the unbelievable torture of this natural prison serves as a reminder of the wickedness of men. The enemy's men lay scattered across the courtyard, buried in debris and torn to pieces by machine gun fire. With blood freshly painted on dark brick walls, the smell of gunpowder was thick and the silence after battle was deafening.\n\nWe were in a place of immense suffering, and whilst many of our men broke down doors to scurry in and rummage for loot, others lowered their weapons to gaze at the daunting site that dwarved them. With the Gulags largely preserved from war, however, this does pose a question: are we to close the site down forever and let it remain a relic of our barbarous past, or must we plunge our hands in the dirty realities of this war so that Russia may live on?"

 RUSwonder.8.desc:0 "With Miass now conquered, our men sweep through the city in search of anything of value in the ongoing conflict with our neighbors. Raiding teams zip across streets, firing at the remnants of enemy divisions holding out in homes and buildings scattered across the urban sprawl, and crackles of gunfire echo throughout the streets from skirmishes a few blocks away. A unit of our men had besieged an encampment holding out in the Ural Automotive Plant, and upon breaching enemy defenses, the Plant was prized from the few dozen men left clinging to their lives.\n\nWith this major manufacturing site under our control, our soldiers will now have greater access to off-road vehicles in later confrontations. This has great potential to improve our supply lines, and aid in improving the speed of our reinforcements. The powerful engines produced in the Ural Automotive Plant are renowned for their speed and dexterity over difficult terrain, and will definitely prove useful in our navigational and incursive efforts across the Russian anarchy. Truly, with the aid of the motor, this is a victory for our people and the future of Russia."

 RUSwonder.9.desc:0 "Our defeat in the plains of Southern Russia have cost us our control over the Zlatoust Arms Plant, a mighty and monumental tool in the wars against our bandit neighbors. The factory that had reliably constructed and manufactured arms for our men now sits under the control of our adversaries, and if we give them enough time before it is taken back they will begin to use the great instrument of war against us. Surviving the German invasion and much of the Russian anarchy, the plant is a symbol of warring resilience in the face of brutal conflict, and it is now pointed against us.\n\nLand dispute and skirmishes plague this side of Russia, and there is no telling of our fate in future conflicts without the factory. However, what is known is that this is a noteworthy defeat, and perhaps the beginning of our end. Our decrease in materiel production will inevitably lead to shortages down the line, and with our forces used to modern production technology, this could spell our undoing. Death does not approach today, and it may not tomorrow, but with less and less weapons to defend ourselves we must be cautious of a time where we are unarmed and alone in the brutality of this war."

 RUSwonder.10.t:0 "Vorkuta Gulags Lost!"
 RUSwonder.10.desc:0 "In our defeats across Northern Russia, the frontlines have pushed us out of the Vorkuta Gulag system and have effectively conceded the complex to the enemy. As we did retreat from the area, prisoners grew ever more feral and hysterical as they witnessed our defeat. The wild frenzy of conflict punished our men, and perhaps to the prisoners it was some kind of sick justice.\n\nWhilst we do have the opportunity to strike back, our men are tired and shaken by the evictions of war. The bitter chill of the arctic winds do not accommodate for the spirits of the defeated, and as honorable as our troops can be, the numbing cold could bring them no respite. We march to regroup in the frontiers of our territories, but with the wild panic of the gulags burned into the memories of our men, their courage for battle seems irrecoverable and may spell our coming defeat.

 RUSwonder.11.t:0 "Ural Automotive Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.11.desc:0 "Our men have fought valiantly in the city of Miass, skirmishing with the enemy and braving the metal shred of gunfire, but their sacrifices were not enough to defend the Ural Automotive Plant from the advances of the enemy. The factory's machines continued to crash and clunk in the haze and chaos of war, exchanging hands as the frontlines danced from street to street.\n\nWe retreat away from the city to encampments in the surrounding wilderness, plotting our recapturing of the factory. However, until then, we are to expect that our adversaries will make use of their new toys to produce the same vehicles that had aided us in our battles in the past. Whilst this is not a dishonourable defeat, it is a defeat nonetheless, and one that could spell our doom as the enemy grows stronger with every engine produced."
 RUSwonder.11.a:0 "A great loss for us."
 
 RUSwonder.12.t:0 "Zlatoust Arms Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.12.desc:0 "The Zlatoust Arms Plant burns bright in the distance as our men retreat into the wilderness to regroup, and explosions of ammunition caches are audible from the frontiers of the battlefield. Defeat looms over the troops as they gaze at the crumbling fortress they had fought for days in to defend. Overcome with a wicked cynicism, many turned away and continued their march, bitter and defeated by the enemy.\n\nThe arms plant, whilst not completely destroyed, has come under enemy control and will most certainly be exploited to produce thousands of arms in the coming weeks. Although our men did gather all they could to carry with us away from the battlefield, it remains an unspoken truth as of now that we will begin to experience tight weapon shortages as the enemy approaches further towards our encampments outside of the city."
 RUSwonder.12.a:0 "We have certainly lost an advantage today."
 
 RUSwonder.13.t:0 "Krasnoyrask Railway Junction Captured!"
 RUSwonder.13.desc:0 "Crashing through the forested mountains surrounding the city, our men have overrun the city of Krasnoyarsk, and with it we have taken the widely-discussed Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction. The tall and mighty station building stretched across the urban space and dominated our soldiers' view; it was a logistical fortress, stuffed with bulky metal trains resting on the platforms.\n\nWith a crucial junction of the Trans-Siberian railway now under our control, we can now more vastly improve our logistical abilities in performing the Herculean task of re-uniting Russia. Piling heaps of ammunition caches and supply crates onto the trains, we can deliver these resources to our frontlines far more effectively, as well as increase the speed in which communications can be delivered. Our grasp over the Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction will stretch our influence across Siberia, and is a step towards extending our power to reunite Russia under our watch."

 RUSwonder.14.desc:0 "Our men spill over the ruins of the Kuznetsk Basin, battling through the remains of enemy fortifications and pockets of wounded squadrons. With gunfire still crackling in the distance, the embers of burning structures clawed at the sky with roaring flames. Wind rushed through the Kuznetsk Depression, carrying with it the blackened stench of the coal reserves now under our control.\n\nWith such rich natural resources now under our administration, we have access to generate immense amounts of energy. The power produced by excavated coal reserves can promptly increase our manufacturing capabilities, as well as provide energy to the many citizens living within our territory. A highly valuable and sought-after location in Central Siberia, this prized asset under our jurisdiction must be put to use soon so we may reap the benefits of the coal mines before any of our enemies manage to snatch it from us themselves."

 RUSwonder.15.t:0 "Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant Captured!"
 RUSwonder.15.desc:0 "The recent fall of Novosibirsk and the retreat of enemy forces across the frontiers of the battlefield has left us in control of the now idle Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. Towering and dormant, the factory was constructed before the Great Patriotic War and has manufactured vehicles capable of flight for her administrators ever since.\n\nNow with the plant under our control, we will soon have access to a fresh arsenal of aircraft fit for any purpose for our armies. Motor engines roar, and squadrons of planes may fly in the Siberian skies bearing our insignia. To first dominate the plains and wastes of Central Siberia by land, we must tame the wild airs of our broken Russia. With this plant, this future may be ours for centuries to come."
 RUSwonder.15.a:0 "To the skies!"
 
 RUSwonder.16.t:0 "Krasnoyrask Railway Junction Lost!"
 RUSwonder.16.desc:0 "Our men hurried into train cars as the enemy's siege was nearing its completion. The crackle of gunfire and boom of artillery shells had shaken our men to the core, but there was some sense of comfort knowing that the trains left the Krasnoyarsk Railway Junction in the nick of time to escape enemy skirmishes.\n\nHowever, although we have our men's lives, we no longer possess the administrative and logistical crown jewel that was the junction in Krasnoyarsk. The extension to communicate and ship resources from one end of our territory to the other was invaluable, but now in the hands of our adversaries. By sacrificing that key location, we had given up our great stretch over Central Siberia and potentially our future in reuniting our shattered Russia."
 RUSwonder.16.a:0 "Curse our enemies!"
 
 RUSwonder.17.t:0 "Kuznetsk Basin Lost!"
 RUSwonder.17.desc:0 "Our men lay battered and bloody, their corpses sprawled across the Siberian frontiers. In the chaos of war and violence, our control over the Kuznetsk Basin was lost and with it goes our access to the immense amounts of coal deep in the ore-rich deposits.\n\nWith such a great power source taken from us, we are likely to experience shortages in production and problems with fuel conservation. We now are forced to turn to rely on finite resources of energy spread thin across our territories. If mismanaged, this could very well spell the end of our existence and chance to reunite Russia, dooming us to the anarchy our men have fought so tirelessly against."

 RUSwonder.18.t:0 "Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant Lost!"
 RUSwonder.18.desc:0 "With our recent defeats in the Novosibirsk region, our recent reports have made it clear that the enemy now controls the Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. With one of the largest aircraft manufacturers now in the enemy's hands, we have been dealt a swift and powerful blow that may lead us towards a humiliating defeat. The factory has been scathed by the tremors of war, but unfortunately our intelligence suggests that the plant may continue manufacturing operations.\n\nNow under enemy control, the factory may open a new front in the air against our men, and with our ability to replenish our planes at a continual rate now nullified, we face the terms of defeat on the battlefield from the air as well as from the front lines. It is only a matter of time before the skies belong to our adversaries, and our struggle towards victory will become ever more burdensome."

 RUSwonder.19.desc:0 "As our troops rushed past the far eastern frontiers, their assault on enemy lands was halted only by the sea. The great Pacific, open and wide, had met our men after bloody battle as the Port of Magadan had come under our control. The icy and choppy waters stretched for miles in every direction in front of them; the mysterious stretch of Siberian waters was a home to by far the most significant port in the Eastern Russian wastes.\n\nA hub of trade and smuggling, with a particular taste for Japanese and American goods, the Port of Magadan opens up greater opportunities for our administration to not only trade wares, but also make a name for ourselves across the globe. Indeed, with this invaluable port under our control, we pray to see our foot in the door to international recognition and trade."

 RUSwonder.20.t:0 "Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station Captured!"
 RUSwonder.20.desc:0 "With the city of Irkutsk recently taken by our Siberian armies, the mighty Hydroelectric Station has come under our control. Constructed under the orders of Genrikh Yagoda after the Soviet Union was pushed back to the corners of Siberia, this work of infrastructure has reliably generated energy for the entire city under his command. A mighty symbol of Russian mastery over nature, the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Power Station may also be a symbol of our control over the Siberian frontiers amidst the chaos of warlordism in the East.\n\nGiven the immense amounts of electricity gathered from the currents of the river, we can utilise the potential of the Hydroelectric station to send power to our manufacturing plants, factories, and the homes of citizens living within our territory. The concrete station towered over the Siberian wastes and churned through great amounts of the Angara's water to generate electricity. We will utilise the natural veins of our fractured nation, and with such a magnificent source of electricity in the region our energy supplies will never run dry!"

With most of the airbase left intact after the siege, we find that the field may be able to be put into purpose sooner rather than later. The aircraft that sit in the hangars sulk, their metal wings still and unused.\n\nWith an entire airbase now under our control, our territories can now support the squadrons of planes tearing across the ashen Siberian skies. With the airfield as an asset in our favor, our men may advance through the Siberian wastes knowing full well that pilots watch over them from the skies. The East is cold, and her winds are colder, but no such chill could render our determination to clash and to fly."

 RUSwonder.22.t:0 "Port of Magadan Lost!"
 RUSwonder.22.desc:0 "Even with our backs turned towards the sea and cornered by enemy forces, we have been forced to abandon the Port of Magadan and retreat into the eastern frontiers to regroup. Whilst battling the untamed wilderness of Siberia poses great threat to our men, our loss of the Port of Magadan will surely hit us even harder if we are not able to snatch it back from our adversaries.\n\nWith American and Japanese goods no longer accessible from the port, weeks remain before our administration and our men begin to starve from a lack of resources, food, and materiel. We must make the decision now to either tighten our belts and brace for impact, or we gather our forces and battle for the port once more. Men will die and heroes will be remembered, but what cost are we most willing to bear for our survival?"

Water still rushes through its crushing rotors, albeit dyed with our patriot's blood and now under enemy control.\n\nWe have no doubt in assuming that they will attempt to make best use of the facility's potential to power great machines and fuel their warring industry against us. Our soldiers watch from the distance as enemy troops and engineers tinker with the smoldering debris that surround the Hydroelectric station, consulting each other on the strategy required to take the facility back. What is certain, however, is that with each moment the dam is under enemy control, the greater power will be amassed in the enemy's war against our brave men."

Our recent reports tell us that our troops have recently lost control of Cheryomushki Airbase after an intensely fought siege, skirmishing between hangars and across airfields.\n\nOur men are weak and tired, shaken by their defeat. Moreover, with our retreat from the airbase, the enemy now has access to airfields and planes to support further aerial assaults against the advancement of our own forces. Cornered by our losses, we must now consider strafe bombing and ground support in any hopeful strategy to recover the appropriated airbase from enemy grips."

Many people view Lenin as the father of a political movement which has, through its stupidity and incompetence, led to the collapse of our nation. Others see Lenin as a bastion of a form of communism true to Marx and Engels, the legacy of which would be betrayed by his heir, Bukharin.

What a fun time it was! But now everything had given way. The old grey hut had lost its thatched roof, and a dead silence replaced the laughter and drunken banter that so often passes through its walls. Meanwhile, the pine trees of the forest loomed overhead, offering neither warmth nor comfort she had found with the humans. She lay there in the clearing, afraid to even look up at the canopy of the woods, and she wanted nothing more than cutting and running out into the countryside. But Sasha had faith in her companions, that they would return and they would hunt again, just like old times.\n\nThe sun rose and set. Night came and went. The eyes of the pine trees looked at her when she slept, when she went out to hunt the little critters that scurry in the undergrowth, and in her tentative attempts to find her absent friends. Hidden in the dense and lush undergrowth were other animals that promised harm, prey that she once tracked and hunted down, and strange men with unfamiliar smells. She was trembling. In these lands, she was utterly alone. Opening her eyes on the second dawn, she stood up on all of her four legs and trotted away. She still believed that they would be reunited, and then all the creatures of the forest would fear her again. But her survival was paramount, and on she walked to the woods, and the pine trees, high as their eyes might be, watched her with inscrutable purpose."

"God damn it," he mouthed to himself, "this really is a shit cigarette." He stamped his feet on the embers. Well, so much for smoking alone on patrol. He shivered. The cold morning air hadn't yet let go of him, though its grip was loosening every second. It would be dawn soon, and he stretched out.\n\nHe heard a twig snap behind him. He turned and leveled his rifle behind him, holding his breath and expecting the intruder to shred him in a few moments. It was a dog, with a missing left ear. "You bitch," he said to it, "you scared me." He wiped his sweat. The dog stared at him with a curious glance. He holstered his weapon and slowly approached it. It wasn't afraid of Vladimir, that's for sure. "Are you lost? What am I saying, of course you are." He laid his hand on its coarse coat, stroking it gently. It took it in stride, and the moment Vladimir stopped, it walked away into the distance.\n\nVladimir watched the dog until it was indistinguishable from the morning blue. He sat down and sighed. He took one of his last cigarettes and lit it, making sure not to spill it this time. Perhaps everyone in Russia was a dog, in a way. He thought of the raiders, the civilians, the workers, and the patrol guards; all of these had lost something. He felt it in his bones, that dearth, that absence. Russia was not home. Russia was not a hospitable place. All that Russia offered were inscrutable cruelty and incomprehensible existence. But maybe someday, like that dog, he would find a home, a place to belong.

Sasha wondered where she should take cover, as the clouds were at the precipice of a deluge. She walked on, thinking that she would find it, wherever she went.\n\n"We won't find anything to eat if this keeps up," she heard a deep voice say, "if your tracking keeps on being this bad." "Shut up!" came the reply, evidently from a younger man, "What the hell did you expect? I'm no tracker. I'm the son of a fa-" "Yeah, yeah. Just keep on looking." She came near them and looked at them. They were two men bent on the end of a deer trail. "If only Dmitri didn't die, we wouldn't be stuck with you-" the old man noticed Sasha, and stopped. She met his eyes, and he didn't look evil at all. He reached into his pocket. Two beef jerky's proceeded out. "What are you doing?" "Shh." He threw them in front of her. She smelt them and was about to devour them before training strained her body straight. The old man said, "Pavel, would you look at that, a trained dog!" and laughed. It had been a long time since Sasha had heard human laughter. He came closer and caressed her neck, gently bringing her to the trail. Pavel picked up the jerky. "Now, do you smell that?" She did. She cantered into the forest, the humans following.\n\nIt's been so long. Her heart ached. She had never been this happy. She remembered the old hut and her friends within. Now she had a home again.

Sergei wasn't stupid; he tried hunting the rabbits, but his shots missed, and when they connected, the bullets riddled his meal with lead. He still remembered the bitter meat and how it made him vomit. The bears towered over him, and he didn't have enough bullets to take them down. The stags seemed to sense his presence and ran too fast for him. His only solace was a pack of cigarettes thrust upon him by the party, as well as some slices of bread he had to ration carefully. He looked down, checking if they were still there.\n\nLeaves rustled in front of him. A dog with a missing left ear stood there, looking at him curiously. His mind sputtered awake at an idea. He put his hand on his pistol and approached the dog slowly. It broke into a gallop after its eyes met his. No, not again, thought Sergei. He knelt and fired. The shot clipped the dog on its hind legs, and it fell. Finally, dinner! He caught up to it to discover it still breathing. It looked up to him pleadingly. "I'm sorry, little one." A final gunshot rang through the air. Sergei stood and took out his knife.\n\nThe pine trees watched as a man butchered a dog. All that happened here were immaterial to them. But as the shadows grow longer and longer, they would turn to see from man and dog, back and forth. As the dusk darkened, their lines blur together, more and more, until the man was no more than a rabid dog, and the dog no lesser than a dead man.

A farmer pleadingly recounted all that he had built on the land, his watching children on the brink of tears in the background.

If they do not back down, we could easily be drawn into a war we are not for. Similarly, the Communes are not likely to be any help of note in any potential fighting, as their small size ensures. Ultimately, the balance of power in the region is in the balance, and whether or not we act will decide the fate of Orenburg and potentially of Russia itself."

He and his men had been given orders to form up along the border in preparation to cross it. That had been three weeks ago, and he and his men were beginning to tire of the waiting. From what he had been told by Colonel Oborin, the bastards on the other side of the Urals were preparing to invade League territory.\n\n He had known men from the Ural Guard, strong men and brave, every last one of them. The thought of abandoning them to their fate turned his stomach, and yet if that was the order he would have to go through with it.\n\n Konstantin turned from his position overlooking the border and walked back to his command tent. The only thing he knew for certain right now was that a request for assistance had been sent to the capitol and there was much debate among the higher ups on what to do. With a final sigh, he walked into the slightly warmer air of the tent.\n\n Before he could do much, he adjutant had handed him a message, one marked for his eyes only. Finally, it seemed, the brass had given him his marching orders."

His unit was currently stationed to act as recon for regular divisions stationed in the interior. His men were a motley bunch, made mostly of old backwoodsman and survivalists who had joined up for a steadier ration count. Despite their ragtag nature, they were loyal and very well disciplined.\n\n At the moment, Nikolai's men watched as an NKVD man from the Black Mountain patrolled the village below. Even from so far away he could feel the man's nerves, something was going on and it was nothing good. He had heard all he needed of the Black Mountain to despise its rulers, but he also understood the necessity of taking control of the region --even if he would prefer to storm the Mountain and kill every NKVD bastard within.\n\n The subject of the man's nerves quickly became apparent when the screaming started. He could see men in a different uniform, a very familiar uniform, moving in on the village from the South. The NKVD forces within the village were bloodying their attackers, but were slowly being pushed back for their trouble.\n\n Breaking radio silence for the first time in almost three weeks, Nikolai contacted his commander. After explaining the situation he awaited his orders."

This means a war with Orenberg will almost certainly lead to them invading us in response. A war that we expect, but aren't quite prepared for.\n\nWe are limited to two options. Honor demands that we enforce our words with military force. Regardless of what we are up against, we are decisive. We do not bother with endless debate like the communes. We will bring this section of rightful Russian territory back into the fold, and anyone who stands in our way will be crushed as well.\n\nAlthough...would it be wise to wait?

The deal we gave him was not good enough, and his guard is prepared to resist us at all costs. It seems the Ural Guard does not fear us, and is prepared to try and fight us like they have against so many others. And, ordinarily, we would be happily obligated to challenge them.\n\nBut there is a complication. On the other side of the mountains, another power will back the Ural League up. They have forces that can match us, and they have the equipment to back the League up. It will mean a massive war with another major power, at an inopportune time.\n\nWe have two choices. Either we get involved with a massive war which will only end when the other power is defeated, or we slink off back to the shadows after being confronted by another claimant to Russia. It's really a matter of if we think we can win. Is a fight right now advantageous or not?"

It states, quite plainly, they will declare war on us if we attempt to enforce our demand in any way. This is,quite obviously, a big problem. Not only because whatever the hell they're doing in there will continue, but because it makes a massive war extremely likely.\n\nNow, the sensible thing to do would be to back down. A war isn't good, especially one that we may lose. Taking our time, getting to full strength, and preparing for the war would be a better idea. A sudden action that is taken without thought could destroy all that we have built and strived for.\n\nThe moral thing to do would be to send our army to crush this maggot that crawled out of the corpse of the Soviet Union, and anyone who wants to defend the crimes they have committed.

They say we cannot afford to look weak by allowing the invasion to proceed uncontested and we shall win the undying loyalty of the people of the southern Urals by coming to their rescue. Once the war is over and our rival has been defeated this will make it easier to persuade the local governments that they would be better off integrating into our state. \n\nOur generals agree that we cannot risk humiliation by sitting the crisis out, but they do not believe it is worth coming to the rescue of the Ural states, pointing to our own plans to annex the region sooner or later. Instead they advocate for our own intervention in response. With the armies of the southern Urals already busy fighting our rival we would be free to sweep in and capture most or possibly even all of the southern Urals. This would also allow us to continue our preparations for a possible future war against our rival. \n\nThe third option would be to avoid getting directly involved in the situation while we continue preparing for a war on our terms.

On one hand, we could agree to integration into the Russian state, surrendering our sovereignty as an independent Kazakh state for status as an autonomy within Russia. On the other hand, we could refuse, and open ourselves to potential invasion by a potentially agressive Russian power.

We will bring this section of rightful Russian territory back into the fold, and anyone who stands in our way will be crushed as well.\n\nAlthough...would it be wise to wait?

 ### Finland Diplo ###
 russiadiplo.37.t:0 "The Viipuri Conference"
 russiadiplo.37.desc:0 "In its short existence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Finland had rarely been inactive. Orbiting our former overlords in the east as we do, diplomacy has always had its place as the shield of our young nation. The Soviet war of aggression in the thirties had been feared, and diplomats had spent their entire careers trying to prepare for it. Now, the era of Russian unification has set a new crisis into motion.\n\nOnce merely one of many risible "government of national unity" , our opponent now stands on the border of our forward line in Onega. Every possible regional rival has been vanquished. Now this unifier has come for the last few pieces of Russian land in western Russia that is not directly shielded by the Germans. And they'll want it quickly, for our military analysts predict the rise of threatening rivals in Siberia and the Far East. The logic of unification demands that the government of western Russia plucks every low hanging fruit as quickly as possible.\n\nRather than use blunt force, this new western Russian state seeks to enter into talks with our government, and has proposed that a conference take place in Viipuri, Karelia. It is perhaps a mercy that this jumped up war band prefers diplomacy. But no amount of words can change the strategic situation that Finland stands alone, that our military buffer zone in Onega shields our population and industry from warfare, and that abandoning it without a fight might invite our future subjugation by Ivan. The Russian's bluster of a massive army crashing onto us does not change the fact that their army is equipped with scraps of decaying Soviet equipment, while ours is modern and well armed. This might be our best and only chance to delay or prevent the formation of a hostile government on our doorstep.\n\nIn the halls of the foreign ministry, there is constant dialogue. Hawks demand a general mobilization order. Doves beg the government to make use of this reprieve to open dialogue with the Russians and see what they desire. No matter our decision, the Russian ambassador waits wordlessly. He probably already knows what course of action we intend to choose."

The government of Finland isn't staffed by fools; the same reasons why our government desires Onega back are the reasons why they refuse to return it. Both of our nations desire to hold strategic ground that might prove essential in any future war between Russia and Germany, or between Russia and Finland. The Finnish generals remember the first winter war, where the Red Army eventually overran the Mannerheim line on the Karelian isthmus.\n\nA more bloodthirsty government than ours might have not bothered with diplomacy. If we cannot convince the Finns to see reason, then we can punish them for their perfidy. They have seen fit to enslave Russians for its protection, to hide in the shadow of the German hegemon. We will weep for the brave men of Onega, forced into servitude by cowardly Finns. But we shall shed no tears for Onega's backers in Helsinki."

Some cynics in our government suspect Helsinki of merely stalling for time to order a full mobilization. The fact remains that war can be avoided. Before anything else, however, Helsinki wants to know our terms.\n\nOnega must be returned to us, its population freed from their janissary duty for Finland. That much is essential. This does not mean, however, that the Russo-Finnish frontier should remain a dagger pointed at Finland's heart. We could simply demilitarize Onega, and sign a nonaggression pact for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Finns would probably accept such a deal, and Helsinki would likely see it as too good to be true... Thus, a better deal would be the return of Onega in full, with our troops in the region. Eastern Karelia will be also be integrated to Russia as an autonomous region, with the Finns granted an open border into the region. This would return to us the arctic port of Murmansk. South-western Karelia and its critical city of Vyborg, or Viipuri in Finnish, would stay under Helsinki's control. Demilitarized zones and non-aggression treaties will follow, preventing any future war between our peoples.\n\nOf course, we could just demand it all. No matter how attached the Finns are to Vyborg and south-western Karelia, their paltry army cannot save them for long. Onega's ramshackle mob of conscripts will not slow us long, if they choose to fight their countrymen at all.

 russiadiplo.40.b:0 "We reject the offer."

 russiadiplo.41.t:0 "Russia Requests Muurmanni"
 russiadiplo.41.desc:0 "As expected, Russia wants sovereignty over Onega back. They also require us to give them back the Kola Penninsula, home to the Arctic port of Murmansk. To accommodate for Finnish population in the region, this land would be integrated into a new Karelian Autonomous Zone, sharing an open border with Finland and a minimal security presence. The borders of our nations would be demilitarized, and a treaty of non-aggression would guarantee a return to peaceful relations. Additionally, the rest of Karelia will be given limited autonomy under a Finnish administration, with military access and open borders to both Finland and Russia.\n\nAbandoning Kola and Muurmanni is seen as a bridge too far by many in our nation. This is a great deal of land, and many of our citizens have moved there and call it home. Refusing this deal might thus be in our best interests; the Russians might then reduce their demands to Onega if fate smiles on us."
 russiadiplo.41.a:0 "Tell the Russians that Muurmani is ours."
 russiadiplo.41.b:0 "We can't risk it. Muurmani must be abandoned."

 russiadiplo.42.t:0 "Russia Requests Karelia!"
 russiadiplo.42.desc:0 "The Russian demands were laid out during the conference, and are widely seen in Helsinki as a bad joke. Couched in diplomatic formulas is the demand for all of Karelia to return to Russian ownership. Viipuri, our second greatest city, would be peacefully given to the Russians. Hundreds of thousands of Finnish citizens would have to be evacuated, and at least one quarter of our industrial base would be given to the Russians. This would be quite generous of us, considering the miserable failure of Red Army attempts to capture the city during the Winter War.\n\nThe Russian demands are no joke, however, for they are quite insistent that these demands must be accepted or rejected in their entirety. These demands for the peaceful drawing and quartering of Finland are too insane to contemplate."
 russiadiplo.42.a:0 "Prepare for war, and expel the Russian negotiators."

 russiadiplo.43.t:0 "Finland Denies Our Offer"
 russiadiplo.43.desc:0 "The Finns have a reputation for being a dour, silent people. Today, their whimsical sense of humor was on display as the negotiators of the Republic of Finland argued that the people of Onega have a right to independence and self-determination. Freed from their puppet master's strings, these unfortunate Onegan civilians now desire nothing more than an end to Russian bullying, according to the Finnish negotiator's logic. This backwater of a backwater Russian province, we're being told, has long aspired to fly free on the international stage as its own nation.\n\nIf the Finns had no interest in diplomatic talks; they could have simply told us so. Now as our negotiators head home, our generals are receiving their orders. We are going to have to do this the hard way after all."
 russiadiplo.43.a:0 "Let's smoke these jokers."

 russiadiplo.44.t:0 "The Viipuri Concordat"
 russiadiplo.44.desc:0 "The Finnish government has agreed to our proposals! Onega will be returned to Russia, and its land, demilitarized.\n\nOur soldiers on the Onegan border have begun celebrating upon hearing the news. Vast bouts of drinking, dancing and singing have been organized in the no man's land along the border, with the newly liberated Onegan militias joining in to celebrate the rebirth of Russia with their brothers to the east. Finnish forward units on the border have mostly retained their positions, but a few have been lured over to the celebrations. Their presence has not been accepted everywhere, but the majority of our soldiers have welcomed their Finnish counterparts. In an era of war and strife unending, peace and friendship deserve celebrations by soldiers weary of fighting."
 russiadiplo.44.a:0 "Peace in our time."

 russiadiplo.45.t:0 "The Back-Up Demand"
 russiadiplo.45.desc:0 "The Finnish negotiators have pushed back on our demands for eastern Karelia. They claim that they cannot let vast amount of territories be transferred, lest they betray thousands of Finnish citizens. The fact that this land was ours before 1936 has not gotten our negotiators anywhere. Helsinki's diplomats have wryly commented that the 1936 borders must not have been satisfactory to the Soviet Union, as it attempted to invade Finland to correct them. Despite several attempts to reassure the Finns that we are not the successors of the Soviet Union, their negotiators have stayed on their position.\n\nIt might still be possible to scale back our demands to the return of Onega, sweetened by offers of a demilitarized zone and a non-aggression treaty. On the other hand, our generals have remained on standby for a different type of negotiations. Perhaps it is time to make a more convincing argument for eastern Karelia by force of arms?"
 russiadiplo.45.a:0 "Keep the negotiations alive."
 russiadiplo.45.b:0 "War over eastern Karelia."

 russiadiplo.46.t:0 "Finland Accepts Offer For Murmansk"

Vast bouts of drinking, dancing and singing have been organized in the no man's land along the border, with the newly liberated Onegan militias joining in to celebrate the rebirth of Russia with their brothers to the east. Finnish forward units on the border have mostly retained their positions, but a few have been lured over to the celebrations. Likewise, our soldiers have finally peacefully crossed the border into the newly established Karelian Autonomy, joining their Finnish counterparts in celebration. While some of the Finns view their presence with caution, the majority of our soldiers have been welcomed by their Finnish counterparts. In an era of war and strife unending, peace and friendship deserve celebrations by soldiers weary of fighting."

 russiadiplo.47.t:0 "Finland Denies Our Demand For Karelia!"
 russiadiplo.47.desc:0 "The Finnish negotiators have been given our demands, and have issued their response. They accuse us of plotting to destroy the Finnish nation, and to dismember them by 'peaceful' means. Viipuri, as they say, as well as Karelia, is rightfully Finnish, and shall not be controlled by our government, which they claim has proven to be overly revanchist and a threat to peace.\n\nWith this, all hope for a settlement has ended. There is not to be a peaceful solution to the Karelian question - rather, the matter must be settled by force of arms. Let our tanks take the field, and the spoils go to the victor!"
 russiadiplo.47.a:0 "To war!"

 russiadiplo.48.t:0 "Russia Asks For Onega"
 russiadiplo.48.desc:0 "Following our denial of the previous Russian demand for the city of Muurmani, the Russians have returned to the table with another deal. Russia wants Onega back, and is willing to keep it demilitarized as a sign of good faith. A treaty of non-aggression would be signed after the territorial exchange, and peace will be the order of the day between Russia and Finland. No mention has been made of eastern Karelia, nor of the critically important city of Viipuri.\n\nWe would be fools to refuse this offer. However, some in our army still insist that there must be a trick to the Russian offer, and that none of their generals have forgotten the shame of the Winter War and the humiliation of Finnish control over Onega. The Russians expect an answer rapidly, and so we must accept or reject this magnanimous proposal."
 russiadiplo.48.a:0 "Accept the deal."
 russiadiplo.48.b:0 "Reject the deal."

 russiadiplo.49.t:0 "The Only Option Remaining"
 russiadiplo.49.desc:0 "The Russian negotiators have not made any counter proposal since our refusal to hand in Karelia. Today, the men representing this new government of Western Russia have simply not turned up to the peace talks. As these diplomats have been observed leaving Vipurii, our scouts in Onega have reported vast mobilizations beyond the frontier. It looks like the Russians have only left us one final option: defend our territorial claims through force of arms. Already our generals are sending out the mobilization order while our Onegan conscripts dig in new lines of fortifications. The long dormant Winter War has begun anew."
 russiadiplo.49.a:0 "The spirit of thirty six lives on in Finland!"

 russiadiplo.50.t:0 "The General Staff Assembles"
 russiadiplo.50.desc:0 "The Onegan conscripts have been busy on the borderland, digging trenches and settling into their forward positions. Ever since we've left the peace talks, the Onegans have followed their masters' bidding and begun preparing for all out war. It is regrettable that we must fight our Russian brothers, but the Finn's arrogance has brought this upon us.\n\nOur General staff's analysis predicts a rapid collapse of the Onegan militia. Beyond them, the lakes Onega and Ladoga create choke points that the Finns intend to defend bitterly. A rapid breakthrough followed by a push into eastern Karelia will bring the Finns to their knees before they fully mobilize!"
 russiadiplo.50.a:0 "War it is, then."

 russiadiplo.51.t:0 "Onega Returned!"
 russiadiplo.51.desc:0 "The Finns have at least seen reason on the Onegan issue. They've released our Russian brothers from their bonds and have agreed to evacuate Onega.\n\nIn exchange Helsinki expects a non aggression pact as well as a demilitarization of Onega. To prove our intentions, only limited military police have moved into the new Onega district, while our diplomats in Vyborg have remained in Finland to hash out the terms of this new treaty.\n\nOur soldiers in the field drink and celebrate. They are joined by many Onegans, and quite a few Finns. There will be peace between our nations, no matter what else the future bring our people."
 russiadiplo.51.a:0 "Peace, a dream so fragile..."

 russiadiplo.52.t:0 "Murmansk Returned!"
 russiadiplo.52.desc:0 "The Finns have caved in! Eastern Karelia and Onega are ours. The port of Murmansk will be returned to us, within an autonomous Karelian Region. Eastern Karelia will be demilitarized, and freedom of movement will let the Finnish citizens of the region visit their relatives and business partners in Finland proper.\n\nFinnish soldiers evacuating the region have done so with a heavy heart, according to our scouts. But this is for the best. As our diplomats in Vyborg have convinced the Finns, resistance to this demand would have only resulted in a costly, futile war of resistance. Our army is not the disorganized mess it was during the first winter war, and the Finnish observers are well aware of this. Far better for a non-aggression and friendship treaty to be signed than for blood to be spilled on the frozen northern soil."
 russiadiplo.52.a:0 "Bloodshed has been averted."

 russiadiplo.53.t:0 "The Finns' Betrayal"
 russiadiplo.53.desc:0 "Service for safety and peace, the Finns assured us. In exchange for martial sacrifice our families would be returned to us. Today Helsinki's ever simmering contempt for our army has been amply demonstrated as the Finnish delegates in Vyborg have turned Onega into just another bargaining chip in their dealings with west Russia. Our land is to be peacefully turned over to the new western Russian state.\n\nOf course; this is not all totally bad. The fact that the Finns are capable of having negotiations with this new regional unifier is a proof that this new government isn't made of crazies. Compared to the damned communists, or to the accursed traitors of the ROA, or the rumor of crazy German and religious fanatics, this new government of west Russia is run by sensible men and women.\n\nNow the men await our instructions. Used to their independence, and having prepared themselves for a decade for just such a war, the men might follow us in a bid for nationhood. But such a bid will have to be done without Finnish help. The resulting war would be ugly, and most likely futile. Perhaps it is just better to take part in this new project of the Russian people?"
 russiadiplo.53.a:0 "At long last our vigil comes to a peaceful end."
 russiadiplo.53.b:0 "This new state is just as illegitimate as the others. We fight!"
 
 russiadiplo.54.t:0 "Onega Refuses The Deal!"
 russiadiplo.54.desc:0 "We've seen crazy things during the Russian Anarchy, but none so crazy as Onega's refusal to accept the Finnish diplomatic decision. Having spent the better part of a decade preparing for an apocalyptic showdown with the WRRF, the men of Onega now believe they can take on us without any Finnish support and win. They claim to be attached to their independence, their former prison in Onega apparently having become their home.\n\nThe soldiers in the field are disheartened when told of this new senseless enemy. Having to retake Onega through pointless bloodshed is a grim new for our men, from general down to the lowest grunt. But we have to get this done. At least the Finns will stand by while we annihilate Onega's madmen."

 #RUS.1049.desc:0 "Following a recent string of victories in his Russian campaigns, General Secretary Momyshuly, the military leader of Kazakhstan, has laid claim to all of Russia. Declaring that the Kazakh Red Army will assume 'provisional leadership' of a 'new Soviet Union' before eager crowds in Kyzylorda, Momyshuly made it clear that military force would be used against any who denied the legitimacy of the new government.\n\nMost of the other Russian states were quick to reject the Kazakh's claim, but none can deny that the Kazakh Red Army has risen to become one of the most powerful forces in Russia. The international community's reaction has thus far been muted - this is not the first time a post-soviet warlord has made grandiose claims toward reunifcation, and the upstart General still has a long way to go if he intends to make this claim a reality."
