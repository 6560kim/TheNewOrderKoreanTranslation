 NIK_THENEWORDER_DESC:0 "As the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed at the end of the West Russian War, it was in Syktyvkar, capital of the Komi ASSR, that the civilian government of the Front found themselves in. From the witches' brew of WRRF officials, Soviet political exiles, refugees, and those who would be unwelcome in other statelets, the Komi Republic took form, establishing a constitution and democratic institutions which served to end the cycles of violence which had afflicted it.\n\nHowever, all is not well in the Republic - political conflict and scheming is reaching a crisis point, and it seems that the days of this democracy are limited."

 ###Leader Bios ###
 POLITICS_NIKOLAI_VOZNESENSKY_DESC:0 "Originally only a middle-level Soviet statesman, Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky found himself as the only guarantor of democracy, flawed as he is, in a small piece of the former Soviet Union. Being remarkable among his peers for extraordinary talents in the economic science and administrative work, Voznesensky was chosen by the Red Army Stavka on the eve of the West Russian War to oversee the recovery mission in the Komi ASSR. For his service to the Soviet province, Voznesensky acquired a considerable popularity among the people of Komi, who saw him as the benevolent statesman wishing to put the benefit of a common man ahead of the bickering and intrigues between the power-hungry Soviet cliques.\n\nAs the result of endless power plays between the Front and the hardline Communist bureaucrats in Syktyvkar, the now-president of the Komi ASSR Voznesensky remained as the sole figurehead in the Republic who could boast about the public support. Disillusioned with the Orthodox Marxist dogma and remaining bitter about the incompetence and pettiness of the Soviet higher-ups that nearly brought Komi to destruction, he reshaped the political system of the Republic into a representative democracy, where the voice of every man or woman can be heard and will be heard, breaking away with the single-party dictatorship.\n\nAlthough the hard efforts of Voznesensky brought daily bread and a sense of confidence for average Komi citizens, the reputation of Syktyvkar brought many unsavory people to the city who seek nothing but eliminate the democracy of Komi through her own institutions. But challenges to Voznesensky come not only from the extremists, but also from his fellow democratic politicians, who question the capability of Voznesenky to maintain the republican values, citing his abrasive and inappropriate behavior for a man of his position and his embarrassing ties to various Socialist groups. However, despite the political pressure, Voznesensky is not a person who wants to abandon the system he envisioned without a fight."
 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DESC:0 "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina was one of the children of Josif Stalin, a Georgian member of the Soviet Union's Central Committee and one of Nikolai Bukharin's fiercest rivals. Although her father vanished from the historical record during the Great Patriotic War, Svetlana was able to safely survive the chaotic evacuation of Moscow and came to find refuge in Sykvytkar, capital of the fledgling Komi Republic. While her father was infamous in Party circles for being a hardliner and socialist ideologue, his parenting seems to have driven Svetlana in the opposite direction, and she quickly associated herself with Komi's rapidly growing political center. They welcomed her as a stabilizing force in a chaotic political system, and she quickly became a figurehead for the fragile center to rally around.\n\nNow that the political situation in Komi has deteriorated, Stalina has stepped up and decided to take the reins of state herself. Although she has resorted to some rather authoritarian methods to maintain order, she insists that they are temporary measures in the name of stability, and that she will soon fully restore democracy to Komi. Some are skeptical of her claims, but her actions still trend toward the center, and she is a far more pleasing candidate for many than the alternatives."
 POLITICS_SVETLANA_STALINA_DEM_DESC:0 "Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina has been praised by her supporters as one of the few voices of stability or sanity in western Russia, and by her enemies as an authoritarian in denial, an opportunist who would take any chance she could to destroy the perceived radicalism she so hates.\n\nWhatever the case, Stalina's success as a politician is as unmatched as her story tragic. Her father, Iosif Stalin, was a Soviet bureaucrat and early supporter of Bukharin, who had died in an industrial accident rumored to be orchestrated on the orders of the Soviet government. In the long period following the death of Stalin, she has lost more and more - her mother, in the Great Patriotic War, her husband, purged by the West Russian Revolutionary Front, and her eldest brother, killed by friendly fire during the collapse of the Front at the end of the West Russian War.\n\nIndeed, Stalina claims that the war is where she first tasted the bite of radicalism, and when she vowed to oppose it at all costs. Stalina's party, the Sovereign Democratic Party, or PSD, gained prominence in the Komi Republic as a big tent comprised of big tents, a place for all who valued a safe and stable Russia over all else. Though Stalina's policies often borrow from left-wing populist principles, it would be most unwise to mistake her for a Marxist, as her father was. The basis for her political stances exists in the principles of "sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism" - the construction of a strong, independent Russia through an assertive foreign policy, heavy support for public welfare, and a strong, modern military.\n\nThrough the democratic process she fought so long to protect, the people have given Stalina their mandate, and the Woman of Steel stands prepared to defend her beloved Motherland from all enemies that may assail it - even if that danger is the unchecked will of the people itself."
 POLITICS_ANDREY_ZHDANOV_DESC:0 "Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov - a name surrounded by either love or suspicion, depending on how much one actually knows about the man. Zhdanov is one of Komi's key politicians, a proud socialist leader with experience from chairing the Leningrad Communist Party before the Great Patriotic War, Zhdanov ended up entangled with the government of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, serving as an influential figure in an attempt to encourage Russian cultural unity against the Germans.\n\nHowever, the Front fell, and with it, Zhdanov's beloved universal cultural program. When the government fled to Syktyvkar and promptly dissolved, Zhdanov stayed behind, forming ties with Mikhail Suslov in the series of coups and power struggles that preceded the formation of the Republic. Despite his more authoritarian socialist stances in the early days of the Republic, Zhdanov has recently taken to pushing for more libertarian initiatives - democratization of a Komi socialist state, encouraging growth of minority culture, and reconciliation with the center-left. Additional initiatives he has supported include a greater synthesis of universal culture, science, and ideology into a general doctrine of Zhdanovshchina, increasing prioritization towards research into scientific management within the Communist Party, and creating standards for 'revolutionary art'.\n\nStill, paranoia seems to follow him, as persistent rumors push the idea that his true nature is not truly changed, but rather lying deep below the surface, waiting for him to acquire true power."
 POLITICS_ALEXEI_KOSIGIN_DESC:0 "An economic mastermind, Alexey Nikolayevich Kosygin is one of the many people to have made himself part of the chaotic politics in Komi. Starting as the director of a textile mill, he was a supporter of the Bolshevik cause but only began to climb the hierarchy of the party and its nation-wide bureaucracy a few years before the war. By the time the Great Patriotic War had begun, Kosygin had been noted by the Soviet leadership as a trustworthy Party member and an overall clever individual. During the small time window between the beginning of the German invasion and the complete collapse of the motherland, he played a key role in evacuating industry to the east. His whereabouts following the dissolution of Bukharin's government remained unknown, until years later, when he emerged in the newly formed Republic of Komi. There, Kosygin distinguished himself as a brilliant economist, and a vocal proponent of the Center coalition that held the country together.\n\nSoon, he would found the Union of Young Reformers, a party of his own which still allied with President Voznesensky, but clearly followed a separate agenda. Eventually, while the coalition he belonged in held out against radicals, the Young Reformers were able to usurp power from the dominant coalition leader, and now Kosygin has become the new President. Unlike Voznesensky and his absurdly close relation with certain factions of the Left, he has been clear on this issue: there will be no negotiation and no alliances with radicals on either side of the political spectrum, no matter what. The democrats must stand on their own, and create an economic power that can challenge other contenders for the reunification of Russia - Kosygin always being the designer of these ingenious plans for reform. How far these reforms will go remains to be seen."
 POLITICS_MIKHAIL_SUSLOV_DESC:0 "Despite his humble origins, having been born in a rural community near the Volga, Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov has made a name for himself in his homeland. Starting from the Communist Youth, Suslov quickly became a prominent member of the Bolsheviks in Rostov and even managed to entangle himself in the local administration of the Party.\n\nWhen the Germans attacked, Suslov was designated to orchestrate guerrillas in the Caucasus. With the arrival of Wehrmacht forces, he was nowhere to be seen. There were rumours that he continued fighting in the woods, or that he was hanged by the garrison, but these rumours were soon proved false for the people of Arkhangelsk, as the man appeared in the city so far away from his home. Soon, just like when he was young, he entered the political stage of the West Russian Revolutionary Front. Climbing up the hierarchy, he became one of the most prominent WRRF politicians, and soon, was granted the prestigious position of Minister of Foreign Affairs. With the passage of time, Suslov was becoming even more influential and it was believed he could be the next Premier. Then, the West Russian War happened.\n\nAs the West Russian Revolutionary Front collapsed, Suslov found himself in the city of Syktyvkar, along with economic planner Nikolai Voznesensky. Together, they carefully created the Komi Republic, but soon this uneasy pact would end as each side had a different vision for the country. Suslov quickly used his position as leader of the red paramilitaries to gain power and influence, and managed to make himself an integral part of the Republic in political and military affairs, which meant removing him from the equation would not be easy. Having remained a puppet master for a long time, Suslov has finally come out to assume leadership as the Komi Republic has become a socialist state, allowing him to carry out his plan for governing the country."
 POLITICS_BORIS_PONOMARYOV_DESC:0 "Boris Nikolayevich Ponomaryov has long been the face of the Komi Republic's Socialists, yet he is not its true leader. A relatively unremarkable historian and party functionary in the final years of Bukharin's Soviet Union, by sheer luck, he was able to flee the German invasion. With the collapse of the united Front in West Russia, Ponomaryov had to once again abandon his comfort, and headed to the newly established Komi Republic, a safe haven for political radicals and revolutionaries like him.\n\nIn Syktyvkar, he was able to come in contact with many supporters of the Revolution, those who wanted a return to the ways of old, before the glorious Union fell. As far away as that dream seemed, it still gained the support of Ponomaryov, who was quickly entangled in the webs of the left wing of the Republic. One man who was particularly keen on including him in his machinations was Mikhail Suslov, the "Puppetmaster". By propelling him to prominence in the party, and securing him a position in the National Assembly as well as some degree of power, Suslov could ensure Ponomaryov's loyalty, who was satisfied with what he had.\n\nNow, the socialists have finally made their move, and one of their loyal members has been expectedly assigned the position of General Secretary. As nothing more but a puppet of the men pulling the strings, Ponomaryov lacks real influence, and remains merely a strong figurehead for the government and population, as well as a way for his allies to remain in the shadows. However, he is absolutely content with that."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DESC:0 "The story of Sergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky is as anomalous as his personality and political views. Born to a Russian merchant and Jewish seamstress, Taboritsky was nevertheless a staunch Russian monarchist and earnest anti-Semite from an early age, trying to get rid of the "Cain's seal" inherited from his mother. Becoming an exile in the Weimar Republic following the Russian Civil War, he acquitanced himself with Russian reactionary circles, reinforcing his beliefs and helping to spread the infamous 'Protocols of Zion' in Germany. Along with his long-time friend Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, he assassinated a former Russian Kadet politician Vladimir Dmitrievich Nabokov in attempt to bring revenge upon those whom he considered the main instigators of the revolution that ruined the Russian Tsardom. As the NSDAP came to power in Germany, he became one of the most enthusiastic collaborators with the Nazi regime among the White émigrés, hoping that the German dominance would pave a road for the restoration of monarchy in Russia.\n\nLike others, Taboritsky joined Vladimir in Vyatka, but soon he became displeased with who he claimed was the 'impostor Tsar', sincerely believing that the true Emperor of Russia, Tsarevich Alexey, miraculously survived and will arrive to his subjects should they prove their loyalty to their rightful ruler. Few in Vyatka could share his eccentric beliefs, but soon he found his following in Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nA person too unhinged for his enemies and friends alike, Taboritsky, however, succeeded to outplay them all and emerge as the sole ruler of the city, claiming the title of the Imperial Regent for Tsar Alexey II for himself. Few expect Taboritsky's delusions to come true, but few doubt his rule will be anything but ferocious one, as his zeal is fueled by long-standing hatred for Bolsheviks and anyone who betrayed the Russian Tsar in his darkest hour."
 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_BURGSYS_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_SERGEY_TABORITSKY_DEAD_DESC:0 ""
 POLITICS_LEV_GUMILEV_DESC:0 "Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov, the only child of famous poets Anna Akhmatova and Nikolay Gumiylov, spent most of his youth being persecuted by the Soviet power for his unreliable ancestry and unorthodox scholarly views. In the years of his exile and wandering across Russia, he thoroughly studied history and ethnography, introducing the concept of passionarity, which postulates that the rise and fall of every historical ethnos is driven by the Passionaryy, the few people who change their environment and society to their vision, driving the history of their people forward. Instead of reducing his discovery to a merely academic matter, he saw that the salvation of Russia lies in the practical application of his theory and fancied himself as the one who will bring the passionarity of the Russian super-ethnos to its maximum heat. Being rejected and ignored by Russian warlords, Gumilyov found his supporters in Komi, among those Russians who felt betrayed and disenfranchised by the Bolsheviks and democrats alike.\n\nGumilyov's deep erudition, amiable personality and impeccable charisma attracted almost every shade of the right-wing in Ust-Sysolsk under his banner, making him the patriarch of the Russian nationalism overnight. The Passionaryy initially were considered an underdog of the Komi politics, however, as Gumilyov proved himself not just as an ardent Russian patriot and charming, if slightly eccentric, ideologue, but also as a ruthless manipulator who does not shun any means to achieve his goals, the right-wing extremism became a force that prevailed over every other political group in Komi.\n\nThough Gumilyov emerged as an indisputable master of Ust-Sysolsk, his ultimate agenda remains unknown to anyone due to his chameleonic and sometimes even opportunistic nature. Whether if he wishes to appeal to the whims of his nationalistic supporters or he decides to pursue his own dream of the Eurasian civilizational empire, the whole Russia stands in waiting of his Scythian advance to bring the dying Western world down."
 POLITICS_SVETLANA_BUKHARINA_DESC:0 "Svetlana Nikolayevna Bukharina was brought up at the very top of Soviet society, being the daughter of General Secretary Nikolai Bukharin. She spent her youth in the Union's best academies, attending galas and cultural exhibitions with the Party's uppermost echelons, and carefully observing her father's debates and political maneuvers. When the Union disintegrated and Bukharin vanished, so did Svetlana. Rumors flew that she had escaped with her father and gone into hiding, gotten "disappeared" by a political rival, or even hiding in a secret bunker complex beneath Moscow. Those rumors were quashed when she eventually resurfaced in Syktyvkar, capital of the (relatively) democratic post-Soviet Republic of Komi. But her idle years had not dulled her political edge.\n\nMany in Komi's socialist movement saw that having her as a figurehead would be a massive propaganda coup, and quickly worked to gain her willing support. But they did not anticipate that she would have ambitions of her own. Through careful manipulation and backroom deals, Svetlana was able to build up a powerful support base, and ended up launching an internal coup against the ideologues who once tried to control her. Now that she sits at the top of Komi's political ladder, people wonder - or fear - what her next move will be. Few believe that her vaulting ambition has run out, and many suspect she may soon turn her eye toward the rest of her father's former domain..."

 NIK_the_minutes_of_the_congress_desc:0 "Another year has passed, and our coalition's Congress has managed to run our republic as well as they can, given our... unfortunate situation. However, the cracks are beginning to show, and factionalism within the republic and even our coalition is growing at an incredible rate.\n\nIf we are to continue our custodianship of Komi, and prevent the radicals from taking power, we must act quickly and decisively to put our enemies down."
 NIK_the_last_years_of_the_voznesentsi_desc:0 "Our ruling coalition is headed by the most left-wing democratic faction - the 'Voznesentsi' under Nikolai Voznesensky. Under their guidance, Komi has seen significant improvement, rebuilding from the bombs, lowering the death toll, and attracting refugees to our towns and cities. However, all is not quite well. Voznesensky's ties to the far left, specifically Andrei Zhdanov, are quite alarming, and a source of constant discomfort among the more conservative members of the coalition.\n\nTime will only tell if the Voznesentsi will be able to keep their position at the head of the party, or another wing will take their place."
 NIK_speak_with_stalina_desc:0 "Svetlana Stalina, daughter of the famous Soviet bureaucrat Iosef Stalin, is one of our most valuable assets in crafting effective means of keeping radicalism down. Her plans, though often ruthless and prioritizing effectiveness, are generally excellent, and have proven a good foil to our rivals' constant scheming.\n\nKeeping her loyalty, and opening our party up to more of her influence, is considered by many to be a critical part of keeping our hegemony. Despite several of the more principled democrats' complaints about her alleged authoritarianism, approaching her can surely only help us."
 NIK_our_paramilitaries_reports_desc:0 "Straight from our paramilitary commander, Petro Grigorenko, comes the latest observations of the eyes of the streets. The previous reports have not given us much confidence in our abilities to control the ever-so-important avenues and roadways of the Komi Republic, and this report is no different.\n\nMore and more, the paramilitaries under the control of Suslov and Gumilyov march onto the streets, controlling warehouses, voting stations, and even entire neighborhoods of Syktyvkar, while our forces falter and shrivel in both their control of democratic-aligned districts and the ability to defend what we have left. We must do something about this now, before the citizen of Komi cannot turn his or her eye without seeing radicals damaging our democracy."
 NIK_the_government_in_check_desc:0 "Nothing in our government has been spared from danger, in one way or another. While we have essentially twiddled our thumbs, both the left and the right have plotted, calculated, and made their moves - with no counterattack from us.\n\nWe are essentially a king with two rooks flanking it. There are only a few moves we are allowed to make, and we must make the right one - lest a mistake is made, and our game is over. The plans to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi must be observed and changed with haste. The fate of the Republic depends on it."
 NIK_eyes_to_the_left_desc:0 "While Gumilyov is a small pest in the byzantine game of Komi politics, a far greater threat must be dealt with: the radical leftists, led by the puppetmaster Suslov and his cronies. With the streets becoming ever more occupied by his paramilitaries, and his poll numbers showing a gradual increase, the emergency to deal with is on this side of the political spectrum.\n\nTo counter this, we must become the Suslov of democracy. No minion of the Communist Party shall be spared from the watchful eyes of our government, and soon, the plotting leaders of the far left shall have to contend with our plans to take them down."
 NIK_observe_leftist_paramilitaries_desc:0 "In our nation, marching paramilitaries down the street may as well be our way of greeting each other. The paramilitary is the lifeblood and invisible hand of every party, including ours, and every plotter with a bit of sense knows it.\n\nBecause of the status and importance of the paramilitary in our Republic, simply watching what their thugs do and say will grant us access to valuable information regarding their plans. Through agents and citizen observations, we can figure out when and where the enemy is - from hour to hour."
 NIK_the_spreading_red_influence_desc:0 "From the mundane restaurant conversations to the poll booths, talks and areas begin to take on a shade of red and gold, hammer and sickle. Those who speak of them in a positive light are no longer far-leftists, but slowly, also ordinary citizens.\n\nThe dissemination of communistic and socialistic propaganda must be halted through our paramilitaries, and our own information for the citizens will replace it. Polling booths will become more guarded, and suspected citizens shall be checked for any left-wing activities. We shall stop their efforts here."
 NIK_the_strike_from_the_right_desc:0 "Even if they are helping us defeat the leftist threat, it seems the situation on the right has not developed to our advantage.\n\nWhile we have been dealing with the communist threat, it seems the fascists have taken advantage of this opportunity to expand their influence and scope. Much like the left, talks of new graffiti, voter intimidation, and paramilitary assaults from Gumilyov have spread throughout our political sphere, and shows no sign of stopping anytime soon. A meeting must be called, and a plan to deal with this new threat must be drafted and carried out."
 NIK_a_new_face_question_desc:0 "Apparently, due to our efforts to crack the left, a split in their party has developed. While this is good for us, very much so, a conundrum has appeared: we do not know who exactly is splitting from the Communists.\n\nThe person has already gained much influence in the party - that much is already known. Said person also was, reportedly, once a lieutenant of Suslov, but has broken away on his (or her) own accord. And whoever this person is now wields much power on the left. Anything about this new leader is derived from those three tidbits of information, and that is all. We must try to find out who this new contender in the political game of Komi is, and quickly - before this new splinter of the left moves to attack."
 NIK_eyes_straight_ahead_desc:0 "While it might seem tempting to classify one side or the other as the "greater evil", our belief is that both sides are a dangerous force to democracy, and that dealing with one side will only strengthen the other.\n\nThe true solution is not to attack others, but to defend ourselves. Democracy can, and will work - all that is needed is the will of our government to fix the problems that are afflicted on us, and the will of the people to resist radical aggression. Stimulating both of these things will help us tremendously in our survival, and allow the Republic to continue existing for the people."
 NIK_distance_from_zhdanov_desc:0 "A source of uneasiness among our government is regarding our leader, Comrade Voznesensky, and rumors surrounding his connections. Allegedly, Voznesensky has ties with the far-left Andrei Zhdanov, even a friendship on the personal level.\n\nEven though we believe these rumors are a Suslovite plot to divide us, they are still deeply concerning, and of course, rumors come from somewhere. Just in case, it is best to implore Comrade Voznesnesky to cut any ties with Zhdanov, and to distance ourselves from any of his parties and actions in general."
 NIK_reinforce_the_center_desc:0 ""Remember, comrades, that the Republic's hopes do not lie in the evil lies of the radicals. Such falsities are there to lure those of us who may not be confident in our governing, to snare them and to brainwash our citizens to serve the aims of the radicals! The solution to these lies is to hold out. No more citizens shall be lost to Suslov or Gumilyov!"\n\nStalina's speech to the legislators outlined our plan to combat the radicals. The center must hold, and to do so, we must muster every effort we can to preserve it and stop others from falling into the hands of the far-left or far-right."
 NIK_the_face_of_the_movement_desc:0 "Svetlana Stalina: asset, orator, fighter.\n\nStalina has in recent times become ever-more important to maintaining the flame of the Republic, and has quickly risen in publicity and fame to the citizens of Komi. An avid anti-revolutionary, her speeches and actions directly confront the threat of the enemies in Syktyvkar and beyond, driving many to our democratic ideology. Now, we will need her more than ever, to stamp the radicals out."
 NIK_let_them_burn_themselves_out_desc:0 "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, is how the saying supposedly goes. Of course, they are not actually our friends, so to speak, but they are very useful tools for cementing our Republic.\n\nThe left wing and the right wing hate democracy, this is true, but to them, there's something even worse than that, that they declare their mortal enemy to combat at all times: each other. Even now, their paramilitaries battle in the streets, looking to obtain ideological supremacy throughout Syktyvkar and the Republic. Of course, once the 'winning' side of these battles are depleted... they won't even bother to put up a fight against us."
 NIK_eyes_to_the_right_desc:0 "Shadows lie in wait throughout our Republic. Their darkness hides under the surface of Syktyvkar, waiting, biding their time, plotting to strike.\n\nThese shadows belong to none other than Lev Gumilyov, united leader of Komi's right wing paramilitaries, and possibly some politicians. While the left can be negotiated with, the plots of Gumilyov will not stop until our downfall. We must focus on the right, and bring them down - starting by listening with our eyes and ears."
 NIK_armed_activities_desc:0 "Right-wing paramilitaries in Komi are well-known for showing little restraint in their intentions and armament. Through the streets, they march with pipes, daggers, and even pistols and rifles in order to intimidate anyone who would be willing to speak out or confront them.\n\nHowever, there is a method to Gumilyov's madness. By keeping track of patterns, noting down locations, and documenting actions, it is possible to obtain information that Gumilyov may not want us to know about - all the better for us."
 NIK_the_extent_of_the_shadow_desc:0 "While Gumilyov is agreed among our government to be the general leader of the far-right, we have not been able to agree on much else. Gumilyov's specialty is distorting and hiding his connections and ties, which sometimes makes it near-impossible to determine how much of his influence is present within our Republic and its institutions. To defeat Gumilyov, we must first reveal where Gumilyov hides. Through our observations and research, the puppetmaster of the right shall finally have his agents brought to light. "
 NIK_the_strike_from_the_left_desc:0 "Crudely sprayed red stars on alleyway walls. Red and gold flags waved in the air and hung from neighborhood houses, if only for a little time. The hills have eyes, the walls have ears - and the body parts are all from Suslov.\n\nSince our campaign against Gumilyov and the right began, a surge in communist activity has been present throughout the streets of Komi. Taking the opportunity and striking our blindspots, they have begun their own campaign against the right, looking to finish them off for good. While this is ostensibly good for us, the left will have a new target when Gumilyov is gone for good: us. We must make preparations and plans for this scenario, before we are caught off guard by a powerful, and influential, red army."
 NIK_believe_in_svetlana_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the only politicians that may be able to crush Gumilyov, Svetlana Stalina is one of our most important assets in the battle against the radicals. Not only do her speeches inspire our politicians, but also motivates our supporters, making them even more willing to fight for their country.\n\nSvetlana is the way forward, and if we are to crush the right (and the left) and bring order to Komi, she must carry the torch of democracy and the flame of the will of the people - of which we have full confidence in her. It is up to us to follow her examples, and stabilize the Republic for good."
 NIK_the_interlude_desc:0 "It seems, if only for a temporary period of time, that things have finally calmed down again. The plotters have retreated out of the public eye, most likely so that they can continue plotting in the dark. The streets have become tranquil, and the legislative sessions are less and less chaotic.\n\nThere is, however, a reason for this calm. Soon, democracy will once again be tested in elections throughout the Republic of Komi. Each and every faction that wishes to see their leader in power now must plan and consolidate, calculating public support and paramilitary control of areas. The time of movement has ended. The time of strategizing has begun."

Each year, a new assembly is elected to the legislative house of Komi, and this election is no different than every year's election: a high-stakes contest where each candidate for the head of the house campaigns to control the Republic, and everything valuable within.\n\nAs per tradition, it is now time to choose our candidate for leader of the democratic party. Each of the three candidates - Voznesensky, Kosygin, and Stalina - will express their positions and why, exactly, they deserve to be the leader of the democrats - and the people. After, we will select a candidate, who, hopefully, will be the best choice for our nation."

We must now begin the process of readying the poll booths, sending out fliers, organizing locations, and more of the standard procedure that bores our legislators to no end.\n\nAs usual, we will call up ready volunteers to do their duty to democracy, and do these tasks for us. And in all of this, of course, we must also be aware of the radicals, for their idea of 'preparations' is something much more sinister..."
 NIK_ensure_internal_stability_desc:0 "In recent days, it has been reported that our party is a "mess"in certain areas, such as the fact that debates over sometimes trivial things can run hot and wild between our Deputies, as well as growing factionalism and refusal of cooperation between party members. While, normally, this has been allowed under the perpetrator's defense of "freedom of opinion and expression", the upcoming election is one of the most critical in our history, and the democratic party cannot permit these problems any longer.\n\nThrough distinct methods, we will ensure that everyone sits down and shuts up - united as one party. No longer shall the chamber erupt into argument every other speech, and no longer shall we tolerate the cracks between our wings. We will be as one, together - we must be, for the radicals shall come as one as well."

It is no coincidence that the bombs always rain down at specific times and more on certain days than others, that their Wehrmacht seeks to enjoy the coffee breaks at their designated hours and days and not any other. They will not stop our "little" democracy. All it takes is a little calculation, and any interruption of the election will no longer come from the air."
 NIK_protect_the_people_desc:0 "A person should always feel safe in their own home - whether from the inside or out. While they do not dare touch our cities, bandits and thugs have been known to roam the countryside, seeking to rob and maim to their heart's content. In addition, the German bombings have been a constant source of casualties, blasting apart anyone that is unfortunate enough to be near their dastardly weapons.\n\nPeople cannot vote if they are busy with other things, such as surviving. Therefore, we must embark on a program to cleanse the bandits from our countryside, guard our borders from any foreign incursions, and defend ourselves from the air raids. Only then shall democracy flourish."
 NIK_watch_the_radicals_desc:0 "The radicals have never believed in the democratic process, even if they say otherwise. While they have been rather quiet in the days leading up to the election, it is always possible they may come out of the shadows at any time. The chessmasters on either side still have aces up their sleeves, and there is no telling exactly what they have in store.\n\nObservation of the paramilitaries are necessary, and any left-wing or right-wing activity will be snuffed out and found. If they have any "funny tricks"they wish to play, we will know - and we will fight back."
 NIK_something_wicked_this_way_comes_desc:0 "Months of rigorous preparation. Days of campaigning. Enjoy it or dread it, participate in it or flee from it - the election comes all the same.\n\nNow comes the trial of democracy, and the ruling with it. Each and every preparation that we have done for this event will now either pay off or let us down. This critical election decides our fate, and the future. Some doubt our chances, and others wish us dead, but no matter what happens - democracy will always prevail in the end."

 NIK_the_affairs_of_the_legislature_desc:0 "As much as our detractors enjoy condemning our Republic for its excess of political intrigue and the occasional bout of violence, there is more to Komi than scheming and intriguing. The policies of the National Assembly, while bitterly contested, as all things are, are a critical element for the thousands of people who are affected by the government's machinations each year. Opening the National Assembly for the year, appointing new party whips, and ensuring that everything functions as normal shall ensure that the functions of the Republic's institutions are as strong as ever.\n\nAdditionally, this will give us the opportunity to cut through precedent and tradition, changing long-standing laws and improving life for the multitudes of citizens of the Republic. Through the tactful exercise of state power, backed by the people, anything becomes possible."
 NIK_bill_the_1962_budget_desc:0 "The 1962 budget of the Republic is a critical document providing a comprehensive list of appropriations for each and every program administered by the government of Komi. However, even with the ruling coalition's dominance of the National Assembly, its passage is not entirely guaranteed. Historically, compromise has been necessary to pass budgets, as every party within the coalition has different ideas on what should be funded.\n\nThe budget, thusly, has become an exercise in pork-barrel spending, with Deputies given appropriations for pet projects to keep them loyal. With the increasing unpopularity of President Voznesensky, however, the National Assembly could, possibly, not be quelled by the usual tricks. Numerous advisors and allies to the President have hinted to him that the usual methods of getting the government on his side will be much less effective during this term, and additional means may be necessary to ensure that the Republic gets what it needs in terms of funding."
 NIK_bill_the_infrastructure_repair_bill_desc:0 "While the Republic has a department of transportation that handles repairs to infrastructure and replacements to damaged watercraft and transport vehicles, the department has constantly delivered complaints about how its funding is insufficient to deal with every issue that it currently faces. A new bill has been proposed to the National Assembly to pass through a special appropriation for the department of transportation, which is to be dedicated specifically to providing aid to their infrastructure repair division.\n\nHowever, certain aspects of the bill are undecided, specifically, labor laws and the exact source for the funds which are to be dedicated. These matters must be decided on in the National Assembly before the bill is to pass."
 NIK_bill_the_mandated_minority_representation_bill_desc:0 "There lies a deeply concerning trend throughout our Republic of inequality in the National Assembly. The majority of the Deputies are Russian, with an extreme minority of the National Assembly made up of the peoples that the Republic bears the name of - the Komi. The proposed bill, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina's PSD, makes a stand for a certain quota of minority representation, with new districts drawn to ensure more minorities are sent to the National Assembly, and the rich cultures of the Komi can be protected from a lack of representation.\n\nUnusually, Stalina and the Left have aligned on this matter, with a large contingent of the Voznesentsi, the PSD, and the Communists supporting this measure. The fate of the bill seems to rest on the groups that can be rallied to support or oppose it - a more moderate bill could gain the support of more of the center, who are concerned about the political ramifications of mandated representation, and marginalize the Left."
 NIK_bill_the_defense_of_the_republic_bill_desc:0 "The Komi Republican Army is a formidable force in the Russian wastes, but has its own set of problems - namely, its small size. Due to our small population and necessarily inefficient census system, the Army doesn't get quite as much manpower as it needs from our current conscription policies. Several solutions have been raised in the National Assembly to address this issue and defend the Republic from hostile neighbors.\n\nWhile the official line of the ruling coalition is to increase the conscription period from one to two years, the Left has proposed an addendum - a loosening of the laws that ban certain people from volunteering for military service, due to participation in certain political organizations. While this is a drastic measure, it could assist the Republic in getting the manpower it needs. The solution, as always, will be decided in the National Assembly."
 NIK_bill_the_equal_zoning_bill_desc:0 "Redistricting is a concern that has long affected many elements within our Republic, from the disenfranchised refugees on the peripheries of our cities, to the politicians attempting to organize their re-elections. The process is infamously arduous within Komi and Syktyvkar specifically, thanks to the bombings and high volume of population transfers thanks to refugees and our lack of resources to run accurate censuses.\n\nThis, naturally, has lead to an environment in which more or less any sort of population distribution can be constructed and made to look official, without cooking the books too much. Behind the curtain, the President has spoken to several Deputies on the redistricting board - giving a favor to certain politicians to make them unassailable in their districts could be just the 'incentive' they need to throw more of their support behind the government's initiatives."
 NIK_bill_the_municipal_pacification_bill_desc:0 "The paramilitary situation has been said to be getting completely uncontrollable, with a general uptick in overall violence over time. Several politicians in the National Assembly, spearheaded by Svetlana Stalina and Alexei Kosygin, leaders of the democratic centre, have proposed a rather drastic bill, one that has been said to increase police powers within 'problem areas' of the Republic to levels not seen since the days of Bukharin. While many politicians in the National Assembly have railed against the bill, calling it a tyrannical government overreach, and a naked attempt at shutting down political opposition to the current ruling parties, one can also argue that this opposition is just an attempt to prevent these politicians' illicit sources of assistance from being persecuted. Whether they like it or not, the bill will come up to vote, and it will all come down to the democratic process."

Already, the previous National Assembly has been arrested and imprisoned, with only those determined to be loyal allowed to take their seats. The era of bourgeois democracy is over in Syktyvkar, it seems - at least, if Ponomaryov and his shadowy backers have anything to say about it."
 NIK_pcoup_appeal_for_a_united_party_desc:0 "The Left, in general, has accumulated a reputation for internal factionalism and bickering within its institutions. However, this is not the time for infighting. To consolidate the influence of the Revolution in Komi, we must cast aside the particularities of our ideological interpretations for now, and focus on effective and constructive governance.\n\nThe General Secretary, with backing from Premier Suslov, will pass a decree immediately, banning factionalism and suspending political activity outside sanctioned events, until the duration of our current crisis is over."
 NIK_pcoup_find_zhdanovs_connections_desc:0 "Andrei Zhdanov. The 'official' leader of the Communist Party in Komi, who has been temporarily sidelined with Suslov's endorsement of Ponomaryov for provisional General Secretary status. The man is considered by many within the Party to be... eccentric, but he is nothing if not skilled and well-connected.\n\nIn order to secure our rule, we must consult Zhdanov in order to link up with his more 'unconventional' allies, and work together to save our new Republic."
 NIK_pcoup_repurpose_the_systems_desc:0 "Now is not the time for idealism. The bureaucracy of the old Republic was crucial for keeping its basic functions online - the essential organs of the state continue to exist under our management, maintaining a sort of bitter standoff with the new ruling party. To ensure that we are capable of governing at all, during and even after the Revolution, addressing the remaining government bureaucrats and reassuring them of our benevolent intentions is a course of action we must follow."
 NIK_pcoup_on_suslovs_orders_desc:0 "While Ponomaryov may be the General Secretary of the Party, and thus the head of state of the Republic, we must remember that a single man does not a socialist system make. Mikhail Suslov, Chief Ideologue of the Communist Party and Premier of the Republic, can be trusted to maintain the essential democratic functions of the Communist Party. Empowering the Premiership to make decisions regarding appointments to high positions, as well as several other functions that were formerly only granted to the President of the Republic, will ensure that the head of the new socialist republic never becomes a dictator."
 NIK_pcoup_lock_down_syktyvkar_desc:0 "The Revolution against the previous government caught many by surprise, and cast Syktyvkar into a state of absolute chaos, as well as destabilizing other urban centers throughout the Republic. While the capital itself is solidly under our control, we must recognize that the outlying rural areas could very well be hosting remnant Republican Army units, and reactionary partisans. Thusly, the Presidium of the Komi Soviet Republic shall pass a decree limiting travel in and out of Syktyvkar, until the current crisis has elapsed."
 NIK_pcoup_mobilize_suslovs_men_desc:0 "Whilst certain socialist heroes and patriots within the old Republican Army have collaborated with our new government, and furnished us with weapons, armored vehicles, and manpower, this is not the entirety of the resources that we are capable of mobilizing. Before the Revolution, Premier Suslov oversaw the creation of numerous socialist paramilitary units and partisans, tasked with working alongside the Party to secure true proletarian rule over the Republic. Now that our control has been established, we can officially commission this reserve into a reorganized Komi Red Army, and establish a truly reliable armed forces."
 NIK_pcoup_hunt_down_Taboritsky_desc:0 "Ivan Serov. The accursed traitor to the Party, that nearly sabotaged our efforts once before. The man that very nearly could make one believe in the myth of "red fascism".\n\nBy the unanimous decree of the Party, Serov is to be brought to justice, effective immediately. In a way, he is to be an example to all of the Republic - an example of the fate that we will bring upon fascists and terrorists. The old Republic was utterly unwilling to resist the forces of reaction, but we will never repeat that mistake."
 NIK_pcoup_paralyze_the_army_desc:0 "The Komi Republican Army, with the exception of the units and officers that sided with us, is something that one could truly call an inherently reactionary organization. With our establishment of a parallel Red Army to replace the Komi Republican Army, the time has come to officially dissolve the reactionary institutions of the previous armed forces. Generals will be imprisoned, fascist infiltrators will be smoked out, and equipment will be repurposed for more constructive causes. The effect on our army shall be significant, but it shall be temporary, and it shall be worth it."

From every building in Syktyvkar, the red flag waves, and in our other cities, proud parades march down main boulevards that were until a mere month ago, dens of the bourgeois. The old Republic has finally come to an end - the capitalist transitionary phase has been snuffed out by the proletarian revolution, and our new socialist republic has been birthed from its ashes.\n\nThe time is nigh for the end of our inward focus, and the beginning of our rightful reclamation of the Soviet Union. The Russian people, and soon the peoples of the world, shall welcome us as liberators!"

The people of the Komi ASSR have cried out for the return of socialist guidance ever since the fall of the Front, and it has finally arrived. General Secretary Zhdanov now presides over the Republic, with his allies filling every post within the executive and National Assembly. The Communist Party has returned, and the people rejoice!\n\nHowever, this is not the time for idleness. Enemies of the people reside behind every post and square of the former Republic - liberals, social-fascists, and the reactionaries that the old government allowed to grow unchecked permeate every 'resistance movement' and hidden-away rival government in the lands that we have liberated. Under comrade Zhdanov, always the grand forward-thinker and visionary of the Party, we will bring them to an end, and uplift Komi into a new age!"
 NIK_zcoup_the_peoples_alternative_desc:0 "Let the people of Komi realize - from the capitol building to the common citizen, that Andrey Zhdanov is what the people have craved for so long. He is a man of passion, who has a strong head on his shoulders, and his affable personality and relatable characteristics make him down-to-earth when compared to the stoic Suslov.\n\nThe government of Komi has failed to provide the people with the voice necessary to show their support for Zhdanov, so in his wisdom, he has chosen to force the gates open and let the citizens express their gratitude, and he he will make this fact well known to anyone who is willing to listen!"

 NIK_zcoup_peoples_political_struggle_desc:0 "It would be silly to think that only those in the high castle can make decisions. Who are we to say that we must shut ourselves off and decide what the people want? Zhdanov's Komi is not a palace of nobles! We must encourage the citizens that it is their word that decides the future of this country.\n\nThose more politically-engaged will be encouraged to join local organizations dedicated to debating the ideas of socialism, while others will be recruited into government offices - the old, the young, the men and the women, all will lead Komi forward!"
 NIK_zcoup_freeze_the_activities_desc:0 "The capitalists and fascists will forever hide in the shadows, waiting for their opportunity to strike and ruin our efforts to advance humanity forward. That is why Zhdanov has proposed an idea - we will take measures, both legal and perhaps not so legal, to slow down the efforts of the opposing parties.\n\nIn his wisdom, Zhdanov will force them to pace their steps in such a way that anything they do will simply be countered with ease. None may bring down humanity, so long as they bear the torch of socialism!"
 NIK_zcoup_seed_the_files_desc:0 "Many things can be said about the capitalists - but the more radical of Zhdanov's government, including Zhdanov himself, see the democratic center as nothing more than a tool to eventually bring in the fascist menace. Much of Komi's population would not agree with this idea, however.\n\nWe have decided to take a course of action that would be inevitable. With manufacturing corruption and bribery within the democratic elements of Komi, we will hasten their downfall and expose them for what they would turn into."
 NIK_zcoup_silence_the_unswayed_desc:0 "There are those who remain who do not share the same vision as us. No, to go a step further, they seek to ruin, torment and corrupt our vision into something else. We will not allow ourselves to be destroyed by reactionary elements. Many times has this happened in history, but it will not happen here. These voices who wish to bring Komi to ruin will be brought down.\n\nAnd such dissent will be silenced forever."

We have safeguarded its existence, and no more will we have to worry about a counter-revolution, or any menace that will taint Zhdanov's vision of a pure, socialist Russia. With the support of our people, nothing will halt Komi's advance. No capitalist or fascist will be allowed to stand in our way. With Zhdanov at the helm, and the countenance of the government, Komi will be unbreakable!\n\nNow that we have ridden ourselves of any guilts, regrets, and mistakes of the past, there is only one path to take.\n\nForward!"

 NIK_bcoup_bukharinas_coup_desc:0 "As Komi spiraled into chaos, Svetlana Bukharina saw her chance and took it, securing the government under the Communist Party. However, this control is incredibly fragile and is at constant risk of being overturned by our opposition. We must act quickly to ensure that the revolution here in Komi succeeds!"
 NIK_bcoup_the_legitimate_option_desc:0 "Just shy of 20 years ago, the Soviet Union was beaten by the Nazi menace. However, this did not mean the end of communism in Russia, as the WRRF maintained control over west Russia until the end of the West Russian War. Despite what some on the right may say, it has only been a few years that Komi has not been under a truly revolutionary banner. Considering all of this, it is a truth that a Komi under communism is the only Komi with any legitimacy. Such a fact is something that we will broadcast far and wide all across Komi, even reaching into the most isolated parts of the countryside, for the people must know of our legitimate cause!"
 NIK_bcoup_fully_seize_the_party_desc:0 "In order to be able to fully control Komi and prevent more chaos, we must first secure control of the Communist Party. While Bukharina does control the majority of the party, there are still those whose loyalties are not to the Revolution and Bukharina. These are primarily Zhdanovites and the most otrhodox of communists who see any change as counter-revolutionary. Of course, beyond the ideological differences in the Party, there are the rats who seek to undermine us from within. We can try to find common ground with the ideological dissenters so that we can avoid infighting, but we must also be certain to to carefully investigate so that we can find and handle any and all people within the Party who want nothing more than to bring ruin to the communist dream."
 NIK_bcoup_propaganda_blackout_desc:0 "All across the radio waves and streets of Komi, propaganda blares. A solid chunk of it is our propaganda, but the rest of the propaganda comes from the desperate attempts of the center and the right to win the people over to their side. Under no circumstance can we allow this to happen. In order to counteract these propaganda campaigns, we must blot it out in any way possible. On the streets, we shall inspire the devotees to tear down the reactionary posters, showing that we will fight them on every front possible. While we rally against the posters and other such physical propaganda, we will also utilize what technology we have to find and eliminate the radio stations that the reactionaries blare their propaganda from. With luck, we can end any and all threats to the revolution!"
 NIK_bcoup_we_are_benevolent_desc:0 "Long ago, Marx wrote about the spectre of communism. He said that it haunted Europe, and that it was a nursery tale that left all in fear. Despite the existence of the old Soviet Union, this spectre haunts many in Komi, from the elderly to even the youth. We need to show the people that despite the current chaos in Komi, we are a benevolent force. While it may be difficult, we have to assist those who have been caught in the fighting in whatever way necessary. By reaching out to the people and helping them in these times, we also gain the benefit of the moral high ground. After all, none of the other parties in Komi would be willing to spend resources on the people in a crisis like this. The people are our lifeblood, and we must support them!"
 NIK_bcoup_fight_to_save_us_all_desc:0 "Komi is a place where there are many, many threats arrayed against the people. Whether it's the fascism of Serov and Safarerivch, or the so-called "democracy" of Stalina, there are countless threats that seek to snuff out the flame of socialism and plunge the people into eternal darkness. Under no circumstance can we allow this to occur. Of course, we must be certain to inform the people that these threats are, as of right now, a constant presence to our safety and freedom. After all, it would not do any good for the people to be misinformed about their present situation. For all the people of Komi, from the children to the elderly, we will fight for their freedom!"
 NIK_bcoup_make_peace_where_we_can_desc:0 "While there are many elements in Komi that must be exterminated in order for the state to stabilize, there are also a surprising amount of elements that can be negotiated with. Some of Zhdanov's old contacts in the DSNP can hopefully be brought over to our side with some negotiating. It is also fairly likely that not everyone involved in the fighting is totally devoted to seeing their particular ideology through. With the right broadcasts and propagandizing, combined with continued victories against the reactionaries, we can hopefully peel off more and more of the enemy soldiers. With deft maneuvering, we can hopefully peacefully end some of the many threats to communism here in Komi!"
 NIK_bcoup_make_war_everywhere_else_desc:0 "Not everyone can be won over peacefully. There are too many reactionaries here in Komi that must be destroyed completely. Whether they lurk in the streets of Syktyvkar or out in the countryside, to allow any of these reactionaries to exist is to beg for the government to be overthrown again. We must take efforts to root out the reactionary menaces by destroying their paramilitaries. Furthermore, we must move to destroy their radio stations to end their spewing of nonsense, weakening their support base. With time, we can hopefully find and take care of the leaders of the reactionaries once and for all, whether they are Stalina or Safarevich. The revolutionary flame of freedom will never be extinguished by these bastards!"
 NIK_bcoup_out_of_harms_way_desc:0 "All of Komi is awash in violence. As it will likely take time for the violence to die down, we must devote efforts to protecting the people. We may justify it with a need for political support, but in the end, many of the people of Komi are innocent civilians who merely wish to live in happiness. To allow them to be gunned down, even for a just cause, is disgusting. They did not ask for chaos to envelop their lives, so why should they face the consequences of others actions? It may cost resources to protect civilians, but it is a cost worth taking, as after all, if we fail to protect those who we represent, are we truly their savior?"
 NIK_bcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "The Soviet banner brought forth much to the Russian populace. It brought industrialization, advanced comforts, and modernity. Most importantly however, it brought freedom to the people. The disaster that was the Komi Republic nearly led to the people losing these freedoms. However, with Bukharina's solidifying control over Komi, it seems more and more likely that the people will remain free. There will be none of Stalina's half-hearted democracy, or Safarevich's fascism! No, there will only be a return of the soviets, signifying that the chains of the people will remain broken forevermore!"

 NIK_gcoup_gumilyovs_coup_desc:0 "With a little bit of luck, and a whole bunch of violence, Ivan Serov and his most loyal supporters now occupy the offices of government in the capital of the republic. The coup was executed flawlessly, with those who attempted to resist readily dealt with, and the most immediate dangers of a countercoup prevented. However, that being said, there is a significant amount of work ahead of us if we are to ensure that our government's power is cemented in Syktyvkar and beyond. We must take steps to pacify the capital, court both our political and civilian allies, among them Taboritsky and the urban workers, as well as smash the Komi left and prevent it from organizing a resistance to our new order. Right now, every minute - no, every second - matters to ensure that our administration is able to extend itself over the entirety of our territory."
 NIK_gcoup_shut_down_the_stagnant_desc:0 "If Serov and his followers are aware of anything, it's the danger posed by Mikhail Suslov and his loyal, fanatical bands of pro-Soviet leftists. For the past few months, if not years, Suslov has regularly ordered political assassinations and street violence from his bands and militias, and they have carried out, without question, every letter of his orders. As such, we can no longer trust the Komi left to sit by "idly" as we solidify our rule; they are surely plotting our demise. Suslov's deviousness, however, is not matched by his political posturing. The stagnant form of socialism preached by the left is far from a convincing path for the Russian people's future. As such, we must make sure that they never come to power. A combination of force and propaganda will ensure that we isolate them and their most fanatical ideologues from the rest of their supporters."
 NIK_gcoup_absorb_belozerov_desc:0 "The Komi left is nothing if not vicious. Caught up in the atmosphere of political chaos and instability, Suslov has become an incredibly ironclad figure, ordering political assassinations and contributing to the chaos in the streets. While Suslov and his attack dogs have had the right as their primary targets ever since the formation of the republic, that doesn't mean that we can't learn from them. In fact, we should ensure that we integrate a number of their tactics for political intimidation and violence, ensuring that our militias and those who command them are well-equipped to deal not just with the leftists, but with the democratic center as well. Right now, at the crucial moment, we should make sure that our competition, vehemently opposed to our Ordosocialism, is not in any position to protest the radical changes that we have planned."
 NIK_gcoup_align_taboritsky_desc:0 "Taboritsky has always been a wildcard in Syktyvkar's right-wing political scene. Regardless, it's no secret that he has a fairly sizable following which could be used to our advantage. However, it's likely that we would have to compromise with the man to ensure that we can win him over to our side.\n\nTaboritsky, despite his dubious character, would be an invaluable tool to preserve our new order in these chaotic times, especially with the amount of power he wields over the militias as a popular figure in their ranks. By aligning his goals with ours, we will be able to ensure not only that we gain a powerful ally, but deflect a potential enemy, at least for now."
 NIK_gcoup_appeal_to_the_clergy_desc:0 "Despite what Suslov and his leftist lackeys may claim, we are, after all, socialists. And who, if not the workers, do we serve? A number of individuals within our party have suggested that we play to our strengths to weaken our enemies and solidify our position. One of our strengths, as much as Serov hates to admit it, is not only his old connection to the left, but also his connection with the workers who the left had so desperately attempted to win over to their side. While we are attempting to consolidate our control of Komi's political apparatus, we should also appeal to the workers of the region, who will know that Ordosocialism is the future for the Russian people! After all, harkening back to as early as the October Revolution, it's clear that the workers, who are used to being organized and consistently desire a role in government, are a potent tool in the hands of those who know how to use them."
 NIK_gcoup_flood_the_streets_desc:0 "Even from our party headquarters, secured by the most loyal of militias, we can hear the chaos going on in the streets of the capital. The coup went off without issue, of course, however the fallout has been greater than we were expecting, and the mayhem that our actions have caused seems to have paralyzed Syktyvkar. Even if we are now nominally in control of the republic, that reality won't last long if we don't take action against the rioters, leftist militia, and political dissidents that are trashing the once-orderly streets of our capital. Thus, we must flood the streets with our supporters, push all the weapons that we have into their hands and court violence against our opponents, lest they take action against us first."
 NIK_gcoup_crowd_dispersal_desc:0 "While it's great to have our supporters in the streets bashing the skulls of our enemies, it's not enough to ensure continued stability going forwards. Drawing on both our militias and our civilian supporters, we need to work on dispersing both current and future potential crowds that may meet that would either threaten or attempt to overthrow our new order. To do so, we have a number of methods at our disposal - political intimidation, the economic strangling of both party institutions and individuals, violence, and the good, old-fashioned firehose. At this point, it's just a matter of selecting what sort of methods we want to use and allocating the resources required to ensure that we can permanently restore order to Syktyvkar first, and after that, the rest of the republic."
 NIK_gcoup_nobody_enters_desc:0 "To our north are the treacherous agents of Suslov's allies. To our south and west are the threats of reaction and the German. In this critical time - at this very moment - we need to ensure that with our mounting internal issues, no external force can take advantage of the instability. By intensifying border patrols, mustering together loyal garrison and militia forces who will be able to prevent the ingress of any potential threat, we will be able to complete Suslov's personal wish that, in his words, "nobody enters into our new state". By isolating Suslov's disconnected leftists and ensuring that anyone caught attempting to enter our territory is treated with extreme prejudice, we can guarantee that our new administration is, for the time being, protected from most external threats of subversion."
 NIK_gcoup_the_guns_of_the_passionariyy_desc:0 "People like Suslov and Zhdanov talk about a "people's revolution" like they know what that would be. It's no secret that their political goals and aims are as disconnected from the people as their lifestyles are. However, Serov and his most loyal supporters, the true Ordosocialists, are just as concerned with the people's needs as workers just as much as they are with their needs as Russians. We must now prepare to cultivate our support among those that would willingly give it - the military, the workers, and any civilians who decide to fight with us against the bourgeoisie who have been reborn through the process of the republic. Once we have done that, and secured ourselves a place at the head of the ex-republic, we can then proclaim our goal of the True People's Revolution, ushering in an era of democratic centralism, a fair economy for the worker, and pride in the Russian nation!"
 NIK_gcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_faithful_desc:0 "Triumph! Now that we've managed to stave off a counter-coup and put our ideological enemies on the sidelines, we can finally begin to focus on the good - Ivan Serov and his most loyal servants have found themselves at the helm of the Komi Republic, and for the first time in a long time, a semblance of stability is returning to the capital and beyond. The nation belongs to the Ordosocialists, and we will work tirelessly to ensure that Russia is reforged in a nationalistic, socialist state! Anything less than that and we risk falling into stagnation and decadence - an unfortunate reality that can be prevented, so long as the correct steps are taken, under the wise guidance of Ivan Serov.\n\nFirst, we will secure the west, and then we can extend our authority over all of Russia! Forward, for Russia and her people!"

 NIK_dcoup_Taboritskys_coup_desc:0 "Many within the government never considered that Sergey Taboritsky could ever be considered a threat. A raving lunatic of an old man, they called him, obsessed with a boy long dead. They would say that power would always lie within the hands of the republic, or the party, or the army.\n\nIf only they were still alive to see Taboritsky now.\n\nHenceforth, Sergey Taboritsky will serve as the Regent of these lands, until the true Emperor Alexei is found. No matter how long it takes, a Romanov will sit upon the throne once more. But that will come tomorrow; for today there are traitors to deal with."
 NIK_dcoup_crush_the_institutions_desc:0 "The Republic of Komi has long operated under a democratic presidency accompanied by a 200-seat legislature. These ineffective institutions weaken Komi, and are exploited by Russia's many, many enemies. As it stands, they only subvert the Regent's - and by extension, the Emperor's - will, which is unacceptable. If the Emperor's glorious vision for Russia is to be restored, then these structures must be purged and the traitors within eliminated."
 NIK_dcoup_no_more_unwritten_rules_desc:0 "There are three unwritten rules in these lands: (1) No killing the leaders of the many factions, for the good of the Republic, (2) Prevent unnecessary death, aid the injured if you can spare it, and (3) Do not interfere with the lives of civilians. These rules restrict the Regent's plans, and allow for the Jewish and Bolshevik infiltrators to grow in power. The factions must be eliminated, for they do not recognize the Emperor, and in fact conspire against him. This is unacceptable, and must be dealt with immediately. Our stormtroopers should not have to spare a thought for the safety of the Emperor's enemies, and any restrictions upon their righteous actions must be eliminated.. The civilians are the greatest place for Jewish and Bolshevik infiltrators to hide once we have destroyed their powerbases. The civilians too must be integrated into the Regent's grand plan to rebuild Russia in preparation for the true Emperor's return."
 NIK_dcoup_no_more_disorder_desc:0 "Disorder is the greatest enemy of the people, fueled by cursed Bolsheviks and Jewish infiltrators, and there is no greater source of disorder in these lands than the legislature. It's squabbling Deputies, it's inefficiency, it's Bolshevik influence. This heretical, unholy structure shall be torn down, so that its rotten influence can be purged. Its Deputies shall be rounded up, and dealt with like Judeo-Bolshevik enemies should be. Under the Regency, all that shall remain is order efficiency, and devotion to the Emperor. The true Emperor of Russia demands it."
 NIK_dcoup_march_to_the_tick_of_the_clock_desc:0 "Back in the day, rulers were chosen by God to rule, it was their divine right. Whatever was the will of these divine monarchs, was the will of Heaven itself. When the foul Bolsheviks took power, they disrespected the will of the Emperor, and therefore the will of God. While the Regent's authority is earthly and unworthy of such a description, it must be made clear that the Regent serves Heaven's greatest and most important servant upon this Earth, the Emperor. Emperor Alexei's divine will must not be disrespected, and any such sin shall be dealt with swiftly and brutally. It is the divine right of Holy Russia's Emperor."
 NIK_dcoup_unleash_the_stormtroopers_desc:0 "The Regent has many loyal followers, but none more loyal than his stormtroopers. This paramilitary organization's duty is to enforce the will of Emperor Alexei. These fanatical soldiers shall be called upon to destroy the regency's numerous enemies, who wage open rebellion in the streets. In order to ensure the Regent's plans are carried out, these soldiers must be righteous, courageous, and merciless in the face of the enemy. They must strike fear into the hearts of the regency's enemies, and destroy any trace of their foul influence left within these lands."
 NIK_dcoup_open_the_arsenals_desc:0 "Many paramilitary organizations patrol these lands, led by those who would deny the Emperor's authority. To more effectively deal with these traitors, we may make use of the extensive Syktyvkar Arsenal. It ranges from nonlethal tear gas to devastating supplies of chlorine gas. We have no need for such extravagant measures shall find their purpose later, for now tear gas and similar armaments shall prove sufficient for eliminating our current enemies. Dissent and rebellion shall not be tolerated under the Regent's watch."
 NIK_dcoup_no_limits_desc:0 "The enemies of the Regent are... more powerful and more populous than initially thought. While we have not yet been forced to use the more extreme measures of the Syktyvkar Arsenal, their time is now. Chlorine gas and similar weapons are needed in order for our stormtroopers to destroy the Regent's enemies. No more limitations to our troops' effectiveness will be tolerated, even if it means the death count will begin to dramatically rise. If it serves the will of the Emperor, then no other path is necessary."
 NIK_dcoup_the_only_movement_left_desc:0 "Democracy. That was the goal of the foul traitors who overthrew the divine rulers of Russia. This heretical concept's end draws near. The Republic has fallen, been destroyed by the Regent's righteous followers. It is time for the Regent to announce this fact to be a formal reality.\n\nFrom this day forward, the Republic is hereby officially dissolved, and henceforth, these lands are now to be ruled by the Regency. This regency shall be helmed by Sergey Taboritsky, until the true Emperor of Russia is found. Long live Emperor Alexei of Russia!"
 NIK_dcoup_komi_belongs_to_the_sturmoviks_desc:0 "It is done. Those foolish enough to stand against the Regent have been crushed, and with the aid of both God - and the Syktyvkar Arsenal - none in the former republic have the strength or will to challenge us. And yet the true work hasn't yet begun. The Regent is not content to simply wait for the Emperor to return to the fold and rule over a city state.\n\nNo, the Emperor will return to a Russia united, and the Regent ready to place the crown upon his head. Preparations will be made to bolster the Imperial Army, augmenting it with the ample supplies of chemical weapons we now possess. Furthermore, detailed plans for industrialization and modernization of Western Russia have already been drawn by the Regent's learned hand, ready to be put into action.\n\nThe Regent has thus declared the reclamation of Western Russia begun."

The Republic is restored, but this may all be for naught if the same forces who nearly destroyed it rebuild their efforts. It is for this reason that we must remain vigilant, and extend our wariness of authoritarianism to the public. \nThe people, turned skeptical by recent turbulence, must be reminded to love democracy.

While we are now in the process of restoring control, this has not yet been felt by the populace. That needs to change. We will keep the streets safe for the people. We will reopen schools, markets and shops. They will see that life is returning to normal, and hopefully, it will restore their faith in our leadership."
 NIK_countercoup_komi_belongs_to_the_citizens_desc:0 "The recent instability has been a dark time in our short history. Our rights and freedoms came under attack, and the Republic itself came very close to falling. Insurgents were in the streets, visiting their thuggery on an undefended people. We were at the precipice of something truly dark.\n\nThrough immense effort, we have made it back. All over the republic, brave men and women have fought for the rights and freedoms we all hold dear. We have fought, and we have overcome. The enemy has been defeated, and moderate forces are now firmly back in control. We have won."

We have struck a telling blow against the leftists and weakling democrats of the Republic, but the struggle is not yet won. The Guide of the Passionarist Revolution exhorts us onwards to greater glory, and it shall be ours. We must tighten the noose around the Republic before anyone else has the chance to topple us from power."
 NIK_ucoup_social_sphere_permeation_desc:0 "The Russian people at large do not understand Eurasianism. They deride us as esoterics, or worse: leftists, for our humane and progressive understanding of our brother ethnoses. Our message must be propagated throughout the Republic, so that the people come to understand what it is we fight for and why our cause is worthy of their support."
 NIK_ucoup_a_common_cause_desc:0 "The other rightists are altogether too reactionary - or, in Serov's case, socialistic - for our liking, but they are not without redeeming qualities. Specifically, their loathing for leftists makes them fanatically dedicated to the common cause of crushing the Republic left-wing bloc. We should appeal to our shared interests, so that we can rally more forces to the defense of our new government."
 NIK_ucoup_sideline_Taboritsky_desc:0 "Sergey Taboritsky is a madman, gripped by delusions of grandeur, but he has his uses. As the only notable monarchist in the Republic, like-minded men flock to his banner, along with many of the Orthodox Church's more fervent defenders. He thus has a large contingent of well-trained, fanatical soldiers at his command. We would do well to court him - if we can bring him under our influence, perhaps we can sideline him more easily later on."
 NIK_ucoup_the_eurasia_plan_desc:0 "We must remember what we are fighting for: not Russia, but Eurasia. Our ambition is not to merely rebuild another stagnant, chauvinistic empire.

 NIK_ucoup_secure_the_concept_desc:0 "Before we embark on the journey towards Eurasia, we must ensure that our support base is secure.

 NIK_unstable_victory_a_victory_for_democracy_desc:0 "After counting every vote, it turns out that the democrats have received a plurality of the vote!\n\nEven more surprising to Komi's citizens, it seems that the moderates have decided to go at it alone. Without a clear majority of the delegates, the resulting government is destined to be an extremely weak one. Yet the parties of the center left to center right have decided to gamble that neither the far left nor the far right will dare to cause a vote of no-confidence so soon after elections. Perhaps the far left and far right militias will give the government at least a month to live?"
 NIK_unstable_victory_secure_the_republic_desc:0 "Barring some unfortunate extralegal violence by paramilitaries, the biggest threat to the new coalition government is a simple vote of no-confidence by fascist or communist deputies. The new government's first order of business is thus to spend every scrap of influence and diplomacy to gather enough confidence and supply agreements to stay afloat for the year. By guaranteeing that the government will not fall while trying to pass a budget, the moderate coalition hopes to gain some time."
 NIK_unstable_victory_a_standing_coalition_desc:0 "Even with the vaguest assurances that the government is free from outside pressure, internal pressure within the coalition also need to be kept in check. When living life on the thinnest of political edges, a single deputy defecting could have disastrous consequences on the government. And so, a generous amount of ministries and positions have to be doled to every coalition partner, with the biggest political party keeping a few choice offices for themselves."
 NIK_unstable_victory_the_defense_plan_desc:0 "The democratic coalition would not trust the fascist and communist with a bucket of warm piss, let alone believe their empty platitudes about respecting the minority government for at least a year. As such, extra precautions are being taken to make sure every single member of the government is free from extreme ideology. Equally important is being absolutely certain that no one in the coalition can be blackmailed, lest the ensuing consequences be disastrous."
 NIK_unstable_victory_stalinas_speech_desc:0 "Among the moderate coalition's few blessing is the backing of Svetlana Stalina. The charismatic woman is popular both within the democratic factions and without, throughout Komi's electorate. By having her go on a public offensive against the communist and fascists, some very needed breathing room could be created for the democratic faction. Stalina is already well known for disliking the ideologues and fanatics that impede Komi's progress. Yet, some within the government worry about rumors of the young woman's ambition. Many worry that her honeyed words might in the end poison the young republic. In the short term, however, the coalition must play all of its cards."
 NIK_unstable_victory_direct_action_desc:0 "Left unsaid in the communist and fascists' pledges not to overthrow the government democratically is the danger posed by their paramilitaries. What's a little coup, between friends?\n\nTo prevent such a catastrophe, a small cabal of coalition officials have begun to cook up some extra-legal defense of the republic. The communist and fascist fear one another more than they fear the weak minority government. Their surprise at seeing the benchwarmers lash out might be just what the coalition needs to survive."
 NIK_unstable_victory_acquire_the_information_desc:0 "As the fascist and communist plot each other's destruction, the coalition government's secret security committee has begun to ramp up its intelligence work. Suslov and Gumilyov are slippery eels, yet many of their subordinates fail to live up to their bosses secrecy. By bribing small time agents of both sides, a sizable pot of information can be built up on both factions. Speed is of the essence, as is a simultaneous strike at both sides."
 NIK_unstable_victory_surround_the_neighborhoods_desc:0 "To a casual observer, it might seem that Komi's republican army is completely compromised; its officer corp riddled with Suslov plants, and many of its best regiments crewed by mercenaries of suspect loyalties. Yet legally speaking, the army's chain of command leads to the civilian government at all times.\n\nNow that the government has intel, army units have been arranged in crucial neighborhoods around the city. By moving rapidly, it's likely that neither side will have the time to use their army contacts before it's too late."
 NIK_unstable_victory_nip_it_in_the_bud_desc:0 "The tell tale sounds of guns and artillery slamming around various points in Komi has kept most of the city's inhabitants hiding indoors. Occasionally, some daredevil wanders out to look for information.\n\nThe shocked communists and fascists have been woken in the middle of the night by army troops. Both sets of paramilitaries are putting up a violent fight, their cause aided by turncoats within the army. No one knows if the government's gambit is likely to succeed or fail."
 NIK_unstable_victory_komi_is_strong_and_stable_desc:0 "Throngs of suspected fascist or communist sympathizers are being marched to various secure prisons around the city. Shock and dismay cloud the eyes of the defeated paramilitaries, woken in the middle of the night by the toothless coalition government and its soldiers.\n\nThe minority government has somehow succeeded in its mission to crush the far right and far left! Some might worry that the city's democracy will forever be stained by the violent crackdown. These men and women simply fail to see that for the first time since its foundation, Komi's republic is now strong and stable! No longer shall violence intimidate politicians of the nation!"

 NIK_comexpansion_the_revolution_secured_desc:0 "Despite the efforts of the reactionaries, communism in Komi has survived. We have managed to weather the coups and counter coups, survived deception, and have even seized power! With the stabilization of Komi, the time has come to look outwards. For too long, Russia has remained divided, split between countless warlords. We will end this chaos and anarchy by first bringing the warlords in our region to heel, then the ones in the rest of Russia. The reactionaries throughout Russia may think the flame of revolution extinguished, but they are wrong, for it has only just begun to burn!"
 NIK_comexpansion_unearth_our_caches_desc:0 "When the Front collapsed and the German bombings increased, a decison was made to hide a large amount of weaponry away, so that a stray bomb or two would not leave Komi bereft of weaponry. Now, with the bombings over, we can begin the process of opening up the caches. Some of the equipment may have been destroyed or stolen, but the majority of the caches that we've opened up to now still have functioning weapons. The access to new equipment will allow us to continue the process of upgrading the army, allowing us to be more ready to begin the process of reunification!"
 NIK_comexpansion_begin_the_rebuilding_desc:0 "After so many years, the German bombs have finally stopped falling. While we weren't able to immediately begin rebuilding, due to the chaos that enveloped Komi, the time has come to fully utilize all of the resources Komi has to offer. We can begin the paving of more roads to reach even the deeply rural lands. Furthermore, we can rebuild the train stations and railroads, and use them without the expectation that they will be destroyed in a matter of weeks, allowing us to transport more resources across Komi at a quicker rate. While one could argue there are many new options open to us, an infrastructure drive is the most pressing matter to complete, as a country is nothing without infrastructure."
 NIK_comexpansion_establish_a_true_army_desc:0 "During the chaos in Komi, we were forced to lean on our militias and the elements of the Republican Army that were loyal to us. However, even though we now control the military, the fact of the matter remains that the military is defensive in nature. To embark on a grand campaign to unify Russia now with our current military would only lead to failure. Therefore, it is clear that we must revamp and reform the military into the Komi Red Army, so that it can not only defend us from threats, but help us push aggressively against our enemies and unify Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_reliable_commissars_desc:0 "While we are in no danger of a countercoup, the fact remains that Komi isn't exactly the most stable of places. Furthermore, we cannot rely on a large number of the politically educated officers due to the fact that many of them were educated against communist ideals. We must begin building a cadre of new political officers, ones that are fully trustworthy, in order to not only prevent an ideological schism between the government and the army, but also so that we can maintain control and stability here in Komi by preventing the army from maintaining sympathies to our enemies."
 NIK_comexpansion_soviet_training_desc:0 "While we have done our best to train the army, the undeniable truth is that we are not up to par. Many of the other warlords have been able to lean on training schools or various generals in order to maintain a more professional standard. In order to rectify the situation, a decision has been made to utilize the old Soviet training schools to help rectify the deficiencies of our army. It may take time for the results to truly be felt, but it is a necessary decision, as the army requires modernization and proper training to make it a force strong enough to unify Russia."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_road_to_archangelsk_desc:0 "Out of all the warlords of Western Russia, the West Russian Revolutionary Front is one of the few that could be considered an ally. While the WRRF is ruled by the military, as compared to our civilian rule, it is still a believer in the ideals of communism. In order to take advantage of this possible alliance, we should send an envoy to the WRRF in an attempt to open up relations. There are fears that the Front may see us as an enemy, as Komi did technically split from it after the West Russian War, but the Front likely needs an ally in Western Russia as much as we do. Cooperation with the Front will see us to victory!"
 NIK_comexpansion_a_pact_with_the_front_desc:0 "Thankfully, our diplomatic outreaches to the Front have been well received, and Grand Marshal Zhukov willing to begin coordinating with Komi. This is, frankly, a stunning victory for Komi, as we now have the support of the old Soviet Red Army, along with access to their materials and equipment. The strategic gains are immense, as not only is our northern flank secure, but we have the upper hand from a diplomatic and a military point of view. We will have to increase our cooperation further with the Front in order to obtain the full benefits, but as long as they are willing, our goals of uniting Western Russia become much easier."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_equal_ally_desc:0 "The nature of our cooperation with the WRRF has been debated amongst the Party. Some believe that Komi is doomed to be subsumed by the Front, while others believe that we must wrest control and reassert civilian control over the military. While civilian control is admirable, the fact of the matter is that the Front has been functioning independently for a long time. To demand that they submit to us immediately would only cause strife with our only ally. No, the proper solution is to stand hand in hand as equal allies who both wish to see Russia liberated from the reactionaries that plague it. Of course, in the future, we may be able to revisit the possibility of fully integrating the Front, but that time is not now. Now, we must look to fighting our mutual enemies."
 NIK_comexpansion_shared_training_exercises_desc:0 "While we have tried our hardest to train our new Red Army based on old Soviet techniques, our lack of access to writings on said techniques has hampered our army's growth of skill. In order to rectify this, we have proposed to Grand Marshal Zhukov the idea of joint training exercises through officer exchanges to allow both the Front's and Komi's army to gain experience from one another. While the Front is likely the more skilled of the two armies as of now, the assistance provided will greatly assist our Red Army in being able to successfully fight against the various warlords arrayed against us."
 NIK_comexpansion_march_as_one_desc:0 "For a very long time, Komi stood alone. A bizarre and antagonistic relationship with the Front, who saw Komi as a splitter that contributed to its loss in the West Russian War. However, those days are long gone, as Komi and the WRRF now stand closer than ever. However, we must ensure that we are truly comrades by signing a mutual defense agreement. This will solidify our alliance, and allow both sides to truly be able to assist the other in the upcoming reunification wars, as an attack on the one will mean an attack on the other. With our northern flank hopefully secured, we can begin to fight the other warlords without fear of a surprise attack. The reunification of Western Russia is at hand."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_icy_reception_desc:0 "It seems, for some bizarre reason, that the WRRF has rejected our efforts to begin cooperation with them, and they have sent our envoy home. Due to this, we have no choice but to assume that the Front is a hostile force, adding one more enemy that must be conquered in order to reunite Russia. It is likely that the Front considers us traitors due to Komi's separation from them after the West Russian War. In any case, it doesn't matter. While the loss of the Front as a potential ally is big, it is not deadly. We must take efforts to ensure that if the Front is to invade, that it is us who will come out on top, not these traitors to solidarity."
 NIK_comexpansion_bunkers_to_the_north_desc:0 "While it would be nice to assume that the Front will be passive, it is highly likely that they are mobilizing in an effort to reunify Russia under their own banner. As we border them, it is therefore highly likely that we will be one of, if not the first target of the Front. We need to ensure that our northern border can withstand an attack long enough for us to mobilize the majority of our forces. The best way to ensure this is by building bunker complexes all along the Sysola. The creation of these bunkers should allow us a suitable defense in case of a conflict, allowing us to protect Komi from the splitters to the north."
 NIK_comexpansion_spread_confusion_desc:0 "The WRRF, despite its opposition to us, is still ideologically backed by the ideas of communism. Therefore, it is highly likely that there are many in the Front who are opposed to its opposition towards Komi. We must capitalize on this by spreading propaganda throughout the Front, secretly, about how it has betrayed the revolution in its darkest hour by turning against a government led by a communist party. Furthermore, we must sabotage the infrastructure and mines of the Front, in order to weaken them. This dual pronged effort of spreading confusion shall hopefully lead to the Front becoming more divided, preventing them from attacking us, and making a campaign against them easier."
 NIK_comexpansion_watching_our_rear_desc:0 "While we can't array all of our forces in defense against the WRRF, it would be remiss to leave the border with them completely undefended. Our recent bunker building efforts have allowed our defensive capabilities to increase, but it is obvious that we must do more. Patrols will increase along the Sysola, and we shall increase observation efforts so that our rear is secured. This increased presence should hopefully deter the Front from attacking, and even if they are to attack, our even greater defenses should prevent them from gaining any significant ground, and inflict a large amount of casualties."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_safe_north_desc:0 "Ever since the West Russian War, Russia has been polluted with countless petty warlords, all proclaiming themselves to be the true savior. No more. The time has come to bring this age of warlordism to an end, and restore the red banner of communism! We must begin to move against the local warlords, bringing them under our rule. Plans must be organized, troops must be moved, and bureaucracy must be ready to help integrate the new territories, as there may very well be resistance to our rule. It may very well be a long struggle before we are able to complete reunification, but we do not, Russia may very well be left in this anarchy for eternity, which would truly be a tragedy."
 NIK_comexpansion_against_the_tsarists_desc:0 "The collapse of the WRRF brought many different warlords to power, many claiming to be the "true" Russia. One of the most egregious warlords of them all is Vyatka. These Tsarists seek nothing but the reimplimentation of monarchism, the system that crumbled under its own weight back in 1917. The Vyatkans are directly to our south, which means that they are undoubtedly the biggest threat as of right now to Komi. We cannot afford to let this menace fester on our border, or else we risk our destruction by these reactionaries. We must seek to exorcise these Tsarists from Russia once and for all, so that we can finally be free from the specter of monarchism!"
 NIK_comexpansion_build_the_line_desc:0 "A war with Vyatka will be anything but easy. It is likely that it will take time for us to fully breach their lines, and therefore we must construct defenses of our own. We must begin to construct fortifications along our bank of the Vyatka river, so that even if we're not able to immediately storm the Tsarist lines, we have a backup plan that will allow us to hold against their armies. This defensive line shall include trenches, bunkers, and observation outposts, everything we need to defend against Vyatka if need be. However, this line of defense, while comprehensive, will not be maximised to its fullest potential, as we need the resources to contribute to the war itself, not just defensive structures."
 NIK_comexpansion_ready_the_south_desc:0 "In order to launch a successful campaign against Vyatka, we need to ensure that we are ready for the war. To this end, we must begin a mobilization effort focused on the south of Komi, so that we have enough troops to actually fight the Tsarists. We will ensure that our troops are able to get into position for this war. Furthermore, we will send our army engineers to the Vyatka river in order to find the best location to cross it. Our generals have determined that crossing and securing the Vyatka river will be the critical priority early in the war, so to improvise a river crossing would be deadly to our war effort. We must be ready to strike down the Tsarists!"
 NIK_comexpansion_attrition_preparations_desc:0 "The Vyatka Army is one of the most powerful in western Russia, and a war against them risks the possibility of devolving into a long and bloody struggle. If this is to happen, we do not want our troops to starve, as that is how one loses a war. To prevent this outcome from occurring, we must begin to stockpile supplies. Armories will be expanded, and food will be preserved to the best of our ability, so that our army can survive a protracted war. We will also make sure that our soldiers have access to adequate clothing depending on the climate. Even if the war with Vyatka lasts for a long time, our efforts ensure we will come out on top!"
 NIK_comexpansion_second_october_desc:0 "All of our efforts in preparing have succeeded, and the time to begin the war against the Tsarists has arrived. We will not allow monarchism to once again take root in Russia! Our troops will cross the Vyatka river and begin the war against Vyatka. Just as our comrades did in 1917, we will strike down the Tsar from his throne!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_monks_in_our_sights_desc:0 "One of the first targets identified by our generals is the Order of Saint George. These fanatical monks rule a fairly small amount of land, and aren't backed by any other warlord militarily. As this will be a forward offensive, we must ensure that the army is ready for such a task. Troops shall be moved into position, but more importantly, we must educate the soldiers on the monk's fanaticism. We must make sure that they understand the flaws of the monks' belief, and just how far they could go in order to make sure that we lose. Our briefings will allow the soldiers to be able to quickly snuff out any pockets of resistance that may exist, as they will understand the madness of the monks."
 NIK_comexpansion_attack_gayinsky_desc:0 "The time has come to attack the Order of Saint George and secure our right flank! Our generals expect the campaign to be short and not too difficult, as the Order is a fairly small warlord, and our army is grossly superior to theirs. In any case, let us push onward for a reunited Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_seize_their_wealth_desc:0 "As we expected, the Gayny monks had managed to acquire quite a lot of religious paraphernalia. However, we did not expect that the value of said paraphernalia to be this high. There is a huge amount of rare and valuable resources, such as gold, stashed away in places where the monks hoped we'd never look. Sadly for them however, some of the people we captured were all too willing to show us where these valuable items were. This wealth will be very useful in funding our efforts to reclaim Russia. We can even use some of this wealth to help fill the treasury! While there might be some more religious people mad about us selling off church property, the fact of the matter is that this money goes to a just cause:the reunification of Russia."
 NIK_comexpansion_reclaim_our_sister_republic_desc:0 "If Komi had a sister, Vologda would be it. Both Republics have attempted to be something approaching neutral, and Komi-Vologda relations have never been horrible. Now that we have begun our efforts to reunite Russia, it is critical that we attempt to reclaim Vologda in some way. It i. certainly possible, given deft negotiations, that we could peacefully integrate Vologda, but a peaceful integration requires both sides to be willing to integrate, something that the Vologdan government may not be willing to do. We must prepare to, in some form, annex Vologda."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_peaceful_option_desc:0 "War is a bloody endeavour. While it is inevitable that we will have to fight in order to secure our control over Russia, we must try our hardest to achieve our goals diplomatically if possible. After all, conflict is costly, and we will need all the money we can spare. In order to integrate Vologda into the Komi Soviet Republic, we must send a diplomatic mission to Vologda to propose integration. This mission will showcase to the Vologdans that we are willing to come to a consensus where no blood has to be spilled. Of course, the mission will also be sure to remind them of the power of the Red Army. After all, the Vologdans may need some convincing in order to be won over."
 NIK_comexpansion_welcome_our_comrades_desc:0 "It seems that our negotiations have succeeded, and Vologda has agreed to join us! We shall begin the process of integrating the Vologdan army into our own, and the leaders of the government have begun the process of ensuring that integration into the Komi Soviet Republic goes smoothly. This peaceful integration is truly a great boon to us, as we can access the full wealth of these lands without needing to rebuild them, leaving us much better off for our future wars."
 NIK_comexpansion_neutrality_is_suicide_desc:0 "Why should we enter negotiations with traitors? These Vologda bastards sold out Russia for the sake of their so-called "neutrality". Even if they agree to peaceful integration, who's to say that they won't betray us at the worst possible moment? Besides, their neutrality has only made them servants of the fascist cause, and therefore not the type of people we want involved with the government in any capacity. We must prepare our troops to conquer Vologda and liberate the people from these fascist servants!"
 NIK_comexpansion_no_mercy_for_splitters_desc:0 "Vologda is nothing but a splitter state, and must be conquered. Our troops are in place, and our supplies are ready for us to march against Vologda. We will conquer this so-called "neutral" state, and liberate its people from the chains they are bound in! The time for war against Vologda is now!"
 NIK_comexpansion_consolidate_our_territory_desc:0 "Our rapid gains of new lands, whether through peace or war, have left the administration overextended. While we have theoretical control over a fairly large chunk of western Russia, the fact is that there are still many pockets within our territory that operate freely, possibly even against Komi! We must rectify this situation now, before we march against the rest of the warlords. More funding and manpower will be devoted to not only keeping the peace everywhere in our lands, but also to our new regional administrations. With the increase of workers and money, the new administrations should be able to begin the process of truly consolidating the new lands, bringing them thoroughly under our control."
 NIK_comexpansion_replentish_the_armory_desc:0 "Our recent wars have left our weapon supplies dangerously low, and it is clear that we need to restock, or risk supply shortages. We must audit all of the captured equipment, and see what can be of use to us. Furthermore, we need to start up new weapons factories and restart the old ones, so that we do not run out of ammunition or rifles at a critical juncture. While this does require us to move our military to a defensive posture for now, it is necessary so that we can succeed in conquering the warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_ensure_industrial_effectiveness_desc:0 "In our conquests, we managed to seize control of a large amount of factories, all in varying states or readiness. While we've been able to get some of them up and running again, there are still many that still need to be properly restored and restarted. We must focus our efforts on ensuring that these factories can not only function, but function productively. We will also ensure that these new factories have workers who understand the power of communism, as to prevent any saboteurs wreaking havoc."
 NIK_comexpansion_satisfy_the_peasantry_desc:0 "The majority of people in Russia are peasants. While there are many who still support us, there are also many who have been corrupted by reactionary propaganda. We must show the peasants that we are a benevolent force, and not a spectre that seeks to ruin their lives. We will accomplish this task by providing the peasants with the modern equipment that we can, so that their lives become easier. Furthermore, we will ensure that the peasants have access to modern amenities and methods of communication, improving their standards of living. Hopefully, these efforts will show the rural people of Russia that we only seek to better their lives, not cast them into hell!"
 NIK_comexpansion_relocate_the_party_desc:0 "With our recent conquests, multiple people in the party have advocated for the relocation of the capital from Syktyvkar to Rykov. While Rykov is a more central location, which would allow us to govern easier, the fact of the matter remains that relocation of the party is a costly endeavour. We would have to stage such a relocation so that our government couldn't be wiped out in a single blow, and the capital would be closer to our enemies. However, there are many who argue that despite the costs, the benefits of moving to Rykov would be immense in the long term. We must resolve this debate now, before we must direct resources into more wars against the warlords."
 NIK_comexpansion_make_good_on_our_deal_desc:0 "When we struck our deal with the Front, an agreement was made to begin the process of integration once Vyatka, Vologda, and Gayny were handled. Now, with their military defeat, the time has come to begin integration! We wholeheartedly expect for the Front to follow through on their end, although there are a few who believe that they will sell us out. In any case, let us reach out to the WRRF to begin the process of integration!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_kirov_conference_desc:0 "As expected, the Front is willing to begin integration talks. While both sides agree in integrating, the details of this unification need to be hashed out. Therefore, we shall host talks between the Front and Komi in the city of Rykov, in order to ensure integration happens smoothly. It is generally agreed upon that Komi will lead the civilian side of the government, while the Front will integrate into and lead the Red Army. With luck, integration will happen smoothly, and we will be ready to smash the rest of the west Russian warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_integrate_their_generals_desc:0 "The WRRF, more than anything, is a state led by its generals. It was Voroshilov who led the Front during and after the West Russian War, and it was Zhukov's rule that allowed Komi and the Front to unify. Therefore, it is very important that we commission the generals of the Front under our Red Army. While symbolic, it shows that the military will bow to civilian authority when it is present, which is a very important precedent to set. Furthermore, this integration of the generals allows us full access to people with a very high level of military acumen, which we desperately need if we are to reunify Russia. Let us bring in the generals of the Front into the fold!"
 NIK_comexpansion_merge_the_bureaucracies_desc:0 "The last step in integrating with the Front is to merge our bureaucracies. As the bureaucracy is a civilian job, it shall fall under our control. There is no need for us to drastically change it, seeing as it is of a sufficiently revolutionary nature already. Furthermore, Zhukov has managed to root out any corrupt bureaucrats that may have appeared after the West Russian War. All that is left for us to do is to reorganize the districts, and ensure that the bureaucracy of the Front reports to us. Through deft negotiations, we have managed to gain the power and might of the WRRF! Now, let us finish bringing the Front into the fold, and move against the remaining warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_backup_plan_desc:0 "It seems that our worst nightmares have come to pass, as the WRRF has declined our offers of integration. It is obvious that the Front seeks to conquer Komi, gaining power in the process, as there is no other reason for them to suddenly decide to turn against us, their allies. Thankfully, we have a backup plan: war with the Front. We must quickly begin to move our troops into position, so that we are ready to destroy the traitors to the north. Of course, we must also attempt to keep these actions as secret as possible, so that they cannot properly respond to our military. The armies of the Front may be experienced, but with luck, we can destroy this upstart military junta before it destroys us."
 NIK_comexpansion_cut_radio_lines_desc:0 "Since we were the closest nation to the WRRF, they relied upon our radio lines and networks for communication for the outside world. Let us cut these lines, depriving them of this network. Such an action will undoubtedly confuse them, as a sudden vanishing of contact tends to do, leaving them scrambling at a critical juncture. Furthermore, it seems that some of their border forces relied on our networks to reach Arkhangelsk, so our destruction of this contact will allow us to assault the border, leaving their soldiers unable to get in contact with their superior officers which prevents our troops from meeting opposition until we have advanced further into the country."
 NIK_comexpansion_take_down_the_revisionists_desc:0 "The WRRF, despite their noble fight against the Germans, have proven to be nothing more than revisionists. If they are allowed to succeed, Russia will become othing more than a military junta, backed by the image of communism! We must declare war and put an end to this farce of communism, before they put an end to us! Forward, soldiers!"
 NIK_comexpansion_incorporate_the_frozen_north_desc:0 "Despite the attempts of the Front, the Germans were able to successfully bomb the far north very heavily. Many of the roads and railroads are in ruins, and the towns and cities need to be rebuilt in order to be of any use. It is therefore prudent that we send economic aid northwards. This economic aid will be focused on the Arkhangelsk Oblast, as it has the most potential for development, and was also bombed the most. We shall build new factories, restore the railroads, and modernize the houses. This economic development should allow for the north to quickly become a productive part of the country, allowing for us to have a stronger economic base as we move against the rest of the warlords!"
 NIK_comexpansion_an_ultimatum_to_gorky_desc:0 "While Gorki's consistent raids against the Germans in Moskowien are greatly appreciated, the time has come to bring the tanks back under the fold of the Red Army. We shall send Averin an ultimatum: to integrate with Komi and our Red Army, or face invasion and defeat. Hopefully, Averin is intelligent enough to pick integration, but if he is not, our armies will storm his lands and raise the red banner high!"
 NIK_comexpansion_strike_the_separatists_desc:0 "The Republic of Tatarstan is yet another example of how separatism strikes at the worst possible moment. While they existed as the Tatar ASSR in the Front, they revolted as the Front collapsed, weakening it even more. Knowing this, it is fairly obvious that they have no interest in peacefully rejoining a communist Russia, therefore leaving us with one option: invasion. We shall strike against these separatists and bring them back under the fold!"
 NIK_comexpansion_end_the_roa_desc:0 "The ROA are nothing but collaborators. They may speak of reunifying Russia and 'freeing' it from communism, but the fact remains that they willingly sided with the people who caused this era of warlordism. The time has come to destroy Vlasov's ilk once and for all, so Russia can be free from these traitors!"
 NIK_comexpansion_eliminate_the_syncretists_desc:0 "The Mladrossi of Bereznik are liked by none. Their attachment to monarchism earns them the ire of communists, and their love for socialism earns them the hatred of monarchists. This syncretist ideology will fall to our guns easily, ensuring that these madmen won't have any influence in our Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_euthanize_the_abomination_desc:0 "There is one thing that communists, monarchists, and even the ROA can agree on: that the Aryan Brotherhood is an abomination. These idiots seek nothing more than to turn Russia into a mirror image of Germany, dooming it to economic hardship and civil war. For the sake of all the innocent people stuck in their lands, we must invade and exorcise Russia of this horrible menace."
 NIK_comexpansion_end_the_islamists_desc:0 "Bashkiria, much like Tatarstan, split from the Front in its weakest moment, dooming it to collapse. It's fairly clear that our only option when it comes to Bashkiria is to invade, and bring it under the red banner once more, as Tugan has stated his intention to not rejoin us. Let us strike against these Islamists and bring their people into the fold!"
 NIK_comexpansion_the_west_is_ours_desc:0 "Despite all of the odds stacked against us, we have managed to bring all of West Russia under one banner, a feat not seen since the 50s. However, our conquests, while glorious, were swift, and we must devote our energies towards consolidating our new lands. We must ensure that Perm is scourged clean of the Brotherhood, that the last ROA soldiers are captured, and most importantly, we must end the lawlessness present in our lands. It will be a difficult task, but one that is necessary, as we cannot afford our state to be on the brink of total anarchy."
 NIK_comexpansion_survey_the_republic_desc:0 "If we are to reunite Russia, we need to have access to the full potential of our territory, which is something we lack as of now. While there is some resistance against us, the primary problem is that we lack knowledge on what our resources are and where we can get new resources.Even with us piecing together everything we have, there are still large swathes of our lands that we know nothing about. The time has come for us to conduct a full survey of West Russia. This survey will include the cities, so we can fully understand what needs to be rebuilt, and the countryside, so we can acquire access to new resources. It may take time, but we need it in order to move forward and unite Russia!"
 NIK_comexpansion_raise_the_banners_desc:0 "Most of our new lands were not run by communists, and it shows. There is a fair amount of apprehension towards the government, as people believe that we will collapse like the Soviet Union of old. We must spread propaganda to inform the people that it was not communism's innate weaknesses that ruined Russia, but the insidious Germans who sought to annihilate us. Furthermore, we must try to encourage people to show pride in the Soviet Union. After all, it was under the Soviet Union that there was peace, not the monarchists or the Russian Republic. We shall raise the red banner of communism in every village and town so the people see that we have returned to liberate all!"
 NIK_comexpansion_prepare_our_industries_desc:0 "With our increased access to resources, combined with our new conquests, the time has come to expand our industrial output. Firstly, we must integrate the Samaran industry into our own. Their output must be factored into our planning and industrial production. Secondarily, we must begin to build new factories in our lands. Our access to new resources allows for our industry to diversify, letting us produce different products. With the combination of Samaran industry and new factories, we can be prepared for future wars, and we can support the industrial workers, which is a core part of our mandate."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_viipuri_conference_desc:0 "The time has come. With the unification of West Russia, the time has come to reclaim Onega. As Finland is a powerful nation, especially when combined with our current army, it is probably easier for us to negotiate with them. We will reach out to the Finns and propose to hold a conference in Viipuri over the Onega issue. This will be our first major international negotiation, and no matter what happens, we must show the world that communism is alive and well in West Russia. All of our efforts have built up to this, so let us prove to everyone that Russia is more than an anarchic wasteland!"

 NIK_comexpansion_secure_the_party_desc:0 "While our party maintains a unified and organized front for the rest of the world, internally the party is a mess. Competing sub-ideologies, infighting, and a general lack of cohesion threatens the very foundation of our state. The members of our party should be made to realize who is in charge and how our party is going to be run from now on. All party members are going to have to be brought onto the same page regarding goals, ambitions, and public relations. Our party will be made into a single, unified front under the General Secretary's leadership."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_matter_of_unity_desc:0 "Maintaining unity within the party is of the utmost importance. It was the weakness of Bukharin's communist party that ultimately led to his downfall. If he had been a stronger leader and kept the party together, we may have even won. Keeping unity within the party is vital for keeping the political system functioning, and a necessary component of Lenin's ideology. We must endeavor to further solidify our power base within the party and ensure our continued political hegemony. The party will be kept unified, at all costs."
 NIK_comexpansion_an_orthodox_front_desc:0 "Even under the weak leadership of Bukharin, the Soviet Union thrived in the 20s and 30s. Industry was built, farms thrived, and peace was had, all through the guidance of our superior Marxist-Leninist ideology. It was Bukharin's indifference to strict ideological adherence and Lenin's ideas of constructing a grand army to protect the Soviet Union that led to our defeat. This time will be different, however. The Republic is to remain staunchly orthodox Marxist-Leninist, under the uncompromising rule of the party."
 NIK_comexpansion_move_for_collective_rule_desc:0 "A state being headed by a single person with a strong power-base is nothing but the seeds of a personality cult, and un-socialist. The socialist state must be ruled collectively, by the Party, with the head of state only as a guiding figure. To do otherwise is to invite tragedy, as we discovered so many years ago during the rule of the incompetent Bukharin. What good has ever come of such dictatorial rule? It has only brought pain and suffering upon Germany and Japan, who's empire's creak and groan under their enormous weight."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_mastery_of_suslov_desc:0 "Suslov is the obvious choice to be General Secretary of the Republic. His expert political maneuverings, strict guiding hand, and adept diplomacy are exactly what we need to keep the party in line and politically consistent. Additionally, Suslov has had years of experience in the party, and is easily one of the foremost senior members. That experience in handling matters of state and diplomacy, both within the nation and without, will be necessary in the coming years. He should be the one to take the lead in our political system and guide the nation into the future."
 NIK_comexpansion_step_into_the_light_desc:0 "The moment has come! The title of General Secretary of the newly christened Komi Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic will go to Mikhail Suslov. Suslov, who's many years of service to the Communist Party and vast experience in the political system have more than earned him the position, will finally be stepping into the public eye. His stage is to be that of the entirety of the nation, coming with all the benefits and challenges that will present him. Regardless of what he does in that position or where he goes with it, it is assured that a new chapter is beginning in Komi."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_party_against_the_puppetmaster_desc:0 "Though there are many in the party who romanticize the early years of the Soviet Union before the Germans invaded, it must be acknowledged that orthodoxy failed us in the past. Bukharin didn't fail because he didn't follow Marxist-Leninist principles well enough, he failed because he followed them too strictly. If Suslov is to become the next General Secretary of the Communist Party in Komi, then that will be our doom. He will lead us down the same path of failure we already tried. No, we must instead forge a new path, our own path. The more adaptive members of the Party must start consolidating their own bloc to oppose Suslov's influence."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_connections_of_zhdanov_desc:0 "Andrei Zhdanov is exactly the kind of man we need in charge of the Communist Party today. Not only has he proven himself capable of bridging the gap between the Suslovites and Bukharinites among us, but his ideas have the potential to transform a new Soviet Union into something never before seen. Additionally, his wide net of political connections and allies give him an already strong political base. If anyone has the ability to bring Russia and the Communist Party into the modern era, it would be Zhdanov."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_foundations_of_society_desc:0 "As part of the Party's ideological re-education program, several treatises and works of communist literature have been added to the official required reading lists of the state, now including several of Zhdanov's own works. His works and manifestos are to be featured heavily in the modern political works section, and describe his vision of Communism bringing the Soviet Union into the future technologically and culturally. These works will serve not only to expand our catalogue of reading material, but also to increase Zhdanov's public exposure and popularity base."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_voices_of_the_people_desc:0 "Zhdanov is a true liberal among us! In recent weeks, he has been ramping up his calls for openness and transparency in government, calling the current system not only opaque, but corrupting in nature. Additionally, he has called for further liberalization of speech, arguing heavily in favor of new legislation protecting free speech, and even made some radical calls for involving the people more heavily in government. These calls for citizen participation and transparency in government have done much to increase Zhdanov's influence and popularity."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_ambition_of_bukharina_desc:0 "Svetlana Bukharina, once the newly-elected firebrand of the Komi National Assembly, has slowly begun to rise up the Communist Party's Ranks. It is no surprise that the daughter of the last General Secretary of the CCCP has found intense popularity among the working class of Komi. It is a surprise, however, to see Bukharina deftly navigate the ossified bureaucracy of the KKP.\n\nThe Party is not dumbed to change. When a descendant of one of the greatest revolutionaries in history seeks power, it would be insane to stop them. Bukharina's talent for governance and her obvious charisma in both one-on-one meetings and mass speeches will aid in the Party's march towards Worker's Liberation. This ambitious woman will be our next candidate."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_word_to_the_soviets_desc:0 "It says something about Bukharina's love for the worker that her base is composed of the self-organized directly elected soviets that dot the Republic and low-level agrarian and industrial institutions regulating much of the Republic's industry. However, this is not to say that she does not enjoy broad support, considering that these soviets and institutions are the primary low-level institutions governing local life in the Union.\n\nUnfortunately, the suggestions of the soviets and other minor institutions often go unheard in the Party ideological programme. To ignore the organs of the people is to not represent the people, which goes against the Party's ideology in and of itself. Bukharina will directly appeal to the soviets and integrate their suggestions into the Ideological programme. All must have a voice, from the general secretary to the singular peasant."
 NIK_comexpansion_inspire_soviet_patriotism_desc:0 ""I ask you, as a humble citizen of this great union, are you - should you - be proud to be Soviet Citizens? It is not an unworthy question. We do not live in a perfect society. Poverty, hunger, greed still remains. We should not judge a society by its current conditions. To do so would paint every union in history as a dystopia without opportunity for change. We should judge a society by its ideals, the ideas that tie us together, that march us forward towards a greater future. The fuel for hope, the engine of change.\n\nWould we not live in subjugation if we did not value freedom or liberty, even if our freedom has not been perfected? Would we not live divided and broken without our solidarity, powerless to the machinations of the ruling class? Would we not live poor and destitute, without places to call home or families to love without our ambition for true egalitarianism?\n\nWould we not live in the darkness of ignorance, the fear of the unknown, without our cosmopolitan, worldly nature? These ideals, the ideals of the Soviet citizen, are surely something to be proud of. The act of being a Soviet citizen is an act of bravery in a world of illiberalism and authoritarianism. We live in one of the truly great societies of modern history, as one of the few that never ceases marching forward. For our ideals.""
 NIK_comexpansion_evaluation_of_party_policy_desc:0 "A key moment has arrived in the Party's history. The Party's yearly evaluation has arrived. Historically, the party's evaluation has been either a bellwether of change or an early sign of the continuing reign of orthodoxy. With Bukharina on the rise and reformists ascending in the party's hierarchy, it may seem to be a certain victory for reformists, but Orthodox evaluators still dominate much of the Party's organs.\n\nCertainly many of Bukharina's methods have proved effective, but the old guard watches carefully for signs of instability or progress gone too far. The question remains: shall orthodoxy take hold once again, or will the reformists take ascendancy?"
 NIK_comexpansion_clamp_down_on_revisionism_desc:0 "It seems as if every few years, new challenges emerge against orthodoxy. And every few years, without fail, we defeat these revisionists. The newest threat that has emerged is the challenge posed by Bukharina, Zhdanov and their gang of reformists. They are dangerously out of line, and may be conspiring to seize party organs as we speak. If we do not take proper action, their dangerous ideas will surely grow to an unmanageable popularity.\n\nClamping down is not just the expedient option, but the morally right choice. Only by silencing unnecessary dissent and enforcing democratic centralism will the Party and the Republic achieve our goals."
 NIK_comexpansion_expel_the_revisionists_desc:0 "The revisionists have gone too far! Bukharina and Zhdanov will destroy the party and the democratic foundations of the republic. When factionalists interrupt the march of the party, the dreams of our forebears are destroyed. It is of tantamount importance that in these desperate times, we adopt desperate measures.\n\nWe will expel Bukharina, Zhdanov, and their thuggish gangs from the Party. Once they have been disposed of, we may call new elections. This time, so-called "reformers" will not be allowed to interrupt the proceedings of the Supreme Soviet. Only those who desire the creation of a true socialist and communist state will be allowed to hold such an esteemed position of power."
 NIK_comexpansion_a_reliable_central_committee_desc:0 "The Presidium is secure from splitters. No longer do revisionists offer heretical proposals that spit in the face of Marx and Lenin. Before the Presidium moves forward and forgets the memory of these upstarts, we should begin introducing motions to insure that the matters of the Presidium remain smooth and uninterrupted, and prevent the introduction of any who would seek to corrupt our worker's movement.\n\nNot all will be happy setting into stone what were already de facto bans on reformers, but it is for the good of the Party, the Presidium, the workers, and the Republic. A semblance of order will be restored to our highest legislative body."
 NIK_comexpansion_refined_at_last_desc:0 "There is no doubt that when Marx imagined the foundations of a true worker's state, he envisioned a state not dissimilar to our own. And it is no doubt that when Lenin envisioned the vanguard party of a socialist state, he imagined something not dissimilar to our own Party. However, it would be a disservice to Lenin to assume that Marxism-Leninism was the final evolution of socialist thought. Work done by our most esteemed political scientists and worker's representatives have refined Marxism-Leninism and clarified it so the state can follow it without a doubt of where to go next.\n\nBy defenestrating splitters, revisionists, and the scum that call themselves "reformists". No more mavericks, no more opposition. The Party can now boldly move forward with our great scientific order. "
 NIK_comexpansion_passing_the_bar_desc:0 "In the early history of the Komi Communist Party, reformists were sidelined at every opportunity. Anyone seeking real change within the Party and the larger community were not welcome to speak their thoughts. Fortunately, the party has changed. The reformists, after years of campaigning, protesting, and maneuvering, have "passed the bar". The Party as a whole now approves our actions. Even if our ideology is not yet the official ideology of the Party or even the one backed with the most popular support, the orthodox faction are now the ones being sidelined for the first time in years.\n\nThis development is a monumental point for the development of socialism in Komi. The road is long, but the path is clear. Now, reformists must march on. That is not to say that there will be no opposition - the remnants of the orhodox faction still remain as a potent threat to changes in the system, and they are enraged that their once dominant ideology is no longer ascendant - but it is opposition that we are sure that we can defeat."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_way_of_the_people_desc:0 "Andrey Zhdanov, once a firm second in command in the Communist Party's structure, has risen to prominence as reformists have taken the reins of the Party. His personal ideology, rooted in a libertarian interpretation of communism, has caught fire among local soviets across Komi. In nearly every town, men march through town, yelling Zhdanov's name and touting his loyalty to the tenets of socialism.\n\nZhdanov and his thoughts will lead us into the future. His popularity is unmatched, his populist rhetoric easy to grasp and egalitarian. This is a man who cares for the liberty of the worker and for the basic liberty of any man or woman. This is the man who will lead the Republic into the future, as the popular candidate of the Communist Party."
 NIK_comexpansion_formally_abolish_purges_desc:0 "With Zhdanov's leadership, the Party will soften its stance on those who hold different ideological opinions in the Party. For change to take place - for democratic change to take place - there must be a wealth of different men and women and a vibrant dialogue. The tradition of mass party purges, removing hundreds of people from the party for their ideology, will end. No longer will those who have barely lifted a finger against the party be expelled from it.\n\nIn its place, anybody who is suspected of counter-revolutionary activity or denounced will have an individual inquiry lead by a neutral commission of party members. Without due process, justice ceases to exist. Without questioning, the party ceases to exist."
 NIK_comexpansion_reconcile_the_factions_desc:0 "Any scholar of political history knows the danger posed by factionalism. The ability of a man to tear apart the social order seems to have some grounding in nature, for it is the natural conclusion to every system in history. And yet, our hindsight will allow us to avoid a certain fate. The scientific order of the party will steer us away from factions.\n\nReconciliation, not conflict, is the key to unity. The orthodox faction thinks us betrayers of Suslov's legacy. Our Party diplomats and envoys will assure them that our Visionary faction seeks to advance Suslov's legacy, ideology, and dream, not stomp on it. The party is just as orthodox, if not more orthodox, then it was before Zhdanov's ascendance. No revisionism is tolerated."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_way_of_the_soviets_desc:0 "There is a new path for the Communist Party. This path is grounded in the people, built from the ground up. No longer will the elite of the Presidium and the Politburo ignore the wishes of the people and spit in the face of Lenin. Bukharina offers this new path, a bright new future for the Party.\n\nBukharina's way has a centerpiece in the traditional soviets, the peasant councils that the old Bolsheviks built upon. The Soviets are the mouthpiece of the people, in their numerous opinions and divisions. Almost every Soviet, however, is united in their support of Bukharina. She proposes elevating them to their previous level of prominence. This massive base has manifested its power in grassroots support for Bukharina. She is the People's Candidate, and so she is the Party's."
 NIK_comexpansion_reestablish_the_congress_of_soviets_desc:0 "Before one can work through the nitty-gritty of governance, they must establish the foundations of democratic rule. In the days of the CCCP, the Congress of the Soviets was the legislature of the people, representing everybody from Belarus to the Tajik Republic. Reestablishing the Congress and turning Komi's legislature into a bicameral affair will offer proper representation and further the advance to Socialism.\n\nSurely, it is just a coincidence that the soviets are the state institutions who support Bukharina's policies the most. That is not to say that the Presidium will be modified in any way, but the Congress of Soviets will elect only representatives of local soviets, largely supporters of Bukharina."
 NIK_comexpansion_in_the_name_of_liberation_desc:0 "Social liberation, the unshackling of the minorities, is of chief importance in Bukharina. For millennia, women have been oppressed by men in a horrid cycle of sexism that never seems to end. Without socialist thought, it is not unthinkable that all women could still be relegated to the position they once occupied in pre-modern life. The rise of Bukharina in the Communist Party has shown the power of Marxist thought to overcome reprehensible social norms. For the first time in history, a woman seems poised to take formal control of the Republic.\n\nHowever, the oppression of women is not the only form of social oppression in the Republic. The disabled, those with mental and physical disabilities, are shunned from their families and find it difficult to find work. People belonging to the Komi ethnic group find it difficult to advance in career fields and face a great deal of inequality with their Russian brethren.\n\nWhile most of the population are staunch believers in the Orthodox Church's teachings, there are a few thousand Muslims, old believers, and Komi native religious believers who are forced to live in small segregated communities and are discriminated against in such innocent acts as crossing the streets.\n\nThe law must not tolerate this. The soviets, both local and national, will legislate against these injustices immediately."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_stars_are_risen_desc:0 "The reformist faction was once relegated to the margins of internal Party politics. It's voice was silenced by orthodox suppression, relentless attack with the party's official ideological platform. No longer are dissident voices suppressed! All oppressed may cry free! The reformists are no longer the "coalition of rising stars" they once were. It is the ruling strand of the party. The orthodox faction are now the ones sidelined.\n\nWith the rapid rise to power comes far more responsibility. The faction - now much of the party - must seize the General Secretaryship, and begin talks to form a formal government to rule the Republic. We may only hope we keep to our ideals as we finally take the reins of power."
 NIK_comexpansion_urge_suslovs_resignation_desc:0 "In the past, Mikhail Suslov had a purpose. He was the glue that kept the party together, a popular figure who nevertheless stayed out of the spotlight. However, one must admit he was staunchly orthodox. His entire career was dedicated to advancing a certain sort of socialism, a certain sort which often came into conflict with Bukharina's brand. To put it frankly, Suslov stands in the way of true liberation. Finally, Suslov is perhaps a little too adept. If he is kept in positions of power, there is no telling what he will do to correct the course of the Party and expel Bukharina from it.\n\nSuslov has one fatal flaw. He no longer has the power. We will send a few party envoys and "encourage" him to resign. Of course, he is not obligated to, per se."
 NIK_comexpansion_the_bureau_of_ideological_analysis_desc:0 "Sinecure is a peculiar word. One might argue, in fact, that the role of a sinecure simply does not exist in Marxist thought. After all, "from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". What harm does a so-called "useless" job bring if each man is entitled to his needs?\n\nThat is not to say that Suslov is receiving a sinecure, as harmless as that would be. In fact, he is to be promoted! A man of his stature should not be relegated to bureaucratic work and party squabbling. A new bureau has been created of which he is the head. This bureau, the Bureau of Ideological Analysis will be one in which Suslov has the sole power to "resolve contradictions between the Party platform and established Leninist doctrine." There is a very real possibility that this bureau may potentially influence some facets of Leninist doctrine in the coming years. It may even lead to some suggestions offered to the Congress of the Soviets! Truly marvelous."

 NIK_demexpansion_the_republic_saved_desc:0 "Rejoice, citizen, for the republic has been saved!\n\nIt has taken our government everything to prevent our young nation's fall into extremism. But now that the dust has begun settling, our political system has been repaired and we stand united to face against the wider world. Soldiers and leaders that had once only been concerned with surviving just another week are now free to turn toward the rest of Russia. With the end of the Anarchy, many factions will no doubt attempt to impose their control on the lands of the former Soviet Union. Our Republic must stand ready to expand outward in order to crush extremists and find new allies for our fledgling nation.\n\nWe have crushed the fascist and communists in Komi, and this experience shall serve us well!"
 NIK_demexpansion_assemble_the_armories_desc:0 "With the end of political violence, many armories and weapon caches that were under the control of extremists elements are now open to access. It will take some time to count everything, but already the available rifles and support equipment can be pressed into service to help equip the Republican Army further.\n\nSecuring as many weapons as possible will also help us douse the embers of political extremism. The days of private militias holding onto weapon stockpiles are finally coming to an end. From now on, the government shall decide who has access to military hardware, and that's that."
 NIK_demexpansion_infrastructure_programs_desc:0 "Now that a map of Syktyvkar no longer resemble a chess board of districts held by a protean mass of paramilitaries of varying allegiance, we are free to roll out unified infrastructure plans. Places where the government has not dared send officials in ages can finally be assessed, improved and perhaps even taxed.\n\nThe least controversial move will first be to improve the infrastructure in and around Syktyvkar. Crumbling roads and buildings do not inspire much hope that the government is looking after the common man. Nor are they much help to an economy attempting to climb out of years of stagnation."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_army_of_the_republic_desc:0 "Komi has always had, on paper at least, a strong army. Since its inception the republic has remained free from foreign encroachment by the quantity of soldiers in the field.\n\nThis has not always been evident to the man in Syktyvkar's streets. Riddled with corruption and factionalism, with entire units either underpaid or overpaid to ensure political reliability, the army of the republic has always been perceived as a right mess. A significant fraction of its total strength is composed of militias and men outside the regular command structure, fighting only in dire emergencies. Now that the Republic desires to expand outward, a more regular state of affairs is needed. Two proposals have been thought up on the army reforms, and it's important to decide rapidly on which one the republic prefers."
 NIK_demexpansion_reform_a_true_army_desc:0 "The first faction proposes scrapping every militia and integrating their men into the regular army. This will be a daunting undertaking, stretching our current army structure to the breaking point. Countless militiamen will have to be screened for political extremism, and those that don't make the cut will no doubt be angry at losing their job and weapons.\n\nCompleting the reform will take time and effort. But as the WRRF has demonstrated in the fifties, a regular army can achieve miracles when properly organized. The republic must end the militias if it is to be safe internally and externally."
 NIK_demexpansion_elevate_gifted_officers_desc:0 "Dozens of smart and dedicated men have joined our army from their former militias. In Komi's hyper competitive period of political instability, one did not rise to the top without a good head on their shoulder.\n\nThe integration of these men has done much to soothe the concern of former militiamen about more purges and arrests of the militias. It has also brought us a treasure of institutional experience. Veterans that have fought in the West Russian War, or helped defend Komi as auxiliary militias are now pouring into our army and helping redefine its doctrines for the better."
 NIK_demexpansion_keep_the_militia_structure_desc:0 "The other approach to reforming our army is to preserve the militia structure. Having armed men outside of the army is a concern for many reasons: some worry about disloyalty from the militias, others point to the dangers of a non-standardized fighting force, or of amateur soldiers breaking at the first sign of danger.\n\nTo others, the militias are a perfectly valid part of Komi's arsenal. They provide large amount of volunteers to defend the rear of the Republican Army; they provide an easy way to train up new soldiers that might one day join the regular army; they show that our reformed government bears no ill will toward its past enemies as all of Komi turns toward the future. Preserving the militias can thus be an essential part of the republic's security policy."
 NIK_demexpansion_popular_mobilization_desc:0 "Our decision to preserve the militia has made us a lot of friends. Militia commanders of all stripes have decided to repay our trust with a call to mass mobilization. Areas of the city long held by the militias with inhabitants that disdained the republic's officials are now beginning to offer their help. A tide of new recruits to the militias and army has begun cropping up. All that is now needed is to train and equip the brave patriots willing to fight for their country!"
 NIK_demexpansion_mission_to_vologda_desc:0 "To the west, general Ivanov maintains a careful position of armed neutrality in Vologda. In the aftermath of the Front's collapse, the good general decided that spilling the blood of Russian civilians for ideological squabbles was simply not worth it. Vologda has kept up cordial, if bemused relations with Komi's unstable republic. The western junta has long appreciated Komi's policy of welcoming all, while disliking the resulting political violence.\n\nWith a newly minted democratic government standing proud, it might be time to revisit the relationship. Komi and Vologda both face external threats from the Front and from southern regimes. A diplomatic mission has thus been sent to Vologda to offer a treaty of peace and friendship between both nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_an_alliance_for_peace_desc:0 "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, our President is scheduled to meet with Vologda's representatives to sign a treaty of peace and friendship. Soldiers and citizens of both side cheered the news that their leadership plans to sign one of the first peaceful reunification of the Russian nation.\n\nMuch remain to be done, beyond this ceremony. The depth of the military alliance, as well as its implication on economical and political matters remain to be seen. But throughout both nations, there is nigh universal agreement that mutual friendship and assistance is the best way forward."
 NIK_demexpansion_establish_economic_ties_desc:0 "As Vologda and Komi get closer, their respectives economy continue rising from the decade of bombing and warlordism. Trade links that had already been significant during the Anarchy are being strengthened by the day. In this light, it is essential for official trade policies to be established between the two allies.\n\nStrategic industries from both side will be integrated, helping both Komi and Vologda to increase their military readiness. Joint investment schemes have also been discussed to help lift up the civilian economy of both nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_freedom_of_movement_desc:0 "The frontier between warlords in Russia is often more of a theoretical concept, consisting of a long range of military checkpoints and demilitarized zones plagued by bandits or lawlessness. While in theory there had been no law prohibiting movement between Vologda and Komi, in practice doing so required several levels of military approvals for private citizens. Traders have long been used to carrying their stack of documents at military checkpoints.\n\nA new treaty is in the work, providing legal rights to Vologda and Komi's citizens to cross the border unimpeded. This will no doubt help friendship and partnership blossom among our nations."
 NIK_demexpansion_mutual_defense_desc:0 "While Vologda might not be totally ready to join any of our future wars of liberation, their generals have agreed to strong mutual defense treaties. In the event of an attack on one side, the other is expected to declare war on the invaders. This defensive alliance will free up much needed resources for Komi's Republican army. Contingency plans for defensive wars will no longer use the hypothesis that the Komi-Vologda frontier requires constant military defense. Likewise, the Vologdan army will be free to tend to its own business, confident in the safety of its eastern flank."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_republic_alone_desc:0 "Today on the Komi-Vologda border, the republic's reformed army will be deployed in a pre-planned military exercise. The Vologdan high command has been dutifully noted of this; rumors on the street in both capital is that while cordial relations will continue, Komi's government has little interest in demilitarizing the border between both nations after receiving Vologda's refusal of an alliance.\n\nWhile disappointed, analysts inside of Komi's government are not too shaken about Vologda's refusal. It is likely that the Vologdan generals would have refused to help Komi in its offensive wars of liberation in Western Russia. In the end, the republic would have always had to fight alone for the freedom and safety of all Russians."
 NIK_demexpansion_enemies_on_all_sides_desc:0 "The unfortunate refusal by Vologda of friendship means that the republic, as always, is surrounded by enemies on all sides. Military planners have thus begun preparing supply and communication lines in the event of any invasion by hostile powers. Plans that had been drafted in the event of Vologdan friendship are scrapped, replaced by scenarios where a hostile western army attacks the republic while it is busy elsewhere.\n\nThe republic stands vigilant, and sleeps with one eye open."
 NIK_demexpansion_expand_emergency_conscription_desc:0 "Going at it alone will require ever more troops in the army. A new call for expanded emergency conscription is being prepared. Our government will explain to every citizen the reason for our renewed conscription policy, and the importance of manning every frontier of the republic. New recruits will be able to free up experienced men for frontier duty, and eventually these veterans will lead the spearhead of our reclamation wars."
 NIK_demexpansion_watch_and_wait_desc:0 "Our frontiers have never been better defended. As troops settle into their new assignments, officers on the border have been given secret tasks. The best and brightest men of each formation are to run reconnaissance patrols in the demilitarized border zones between us and our rivals. The men are to probe enemy fortifications, observe enemy patrol frequency and destinations, and do their best to assess weak points in enemy lines. This information will be crucial once we go on the offensive."
 NIK_demexpansion_between_three_foes_desc:0 ""Citizens! My friends, our republic is in grave danger. To the north lie the remnants of the Soviet Union, haunted by its failures and angry at our independence. Even as we speak, the northern Red Army plots our undoing!\n\nTo the south and east, things are not any better. Deluded tsarist remnants wish to turn back the clock and reimpose the shackles of autocracy on our free citizens. In this project they resemble our eastern neighbors. In Gayny, a theocracy blames Russia's woes not on the evil of German fascism, but on the anger of an unforgiving God. These madmen believe that only by subjugating Russia to the church's whim will the people be saved.\n\nThe republic rejects this madness! It is not a cabal of communist or tsarist military officer that can free Russia. Nor can its salvation come from subservience to crazed monks. The only power strong enough to free Russia is its citizens. We must be on our guards!"\n Extract from President [NIK.GetLeader]'s speech to the republic."
 NIK_demexpansion_defense_stratagems_desc:0 "The work that began during the early reforms of the Republican Army is now complete. The army's commanders have presented to the civilian authorities several military plans as well as new doctrinal recommendations. The doctrinal ideas will help us modernize our army and train a new generation of soldiers and officers. The military plans provide a wide range of military campaigns against neighboring threats to the republic's safety.\n\nIt is likely that the civilian leadership will bring a few recommendations of its own. Nevertheless, both generals and politicians are confident in the republic's capacity to destroy its closest foes."
 NIK_demexpansion_against_the_communists_desc:0 "To the north, the Western Russian Revolutionary Front. The largest remnant of the Soviet government, the Front fought valiantly in the fifties and almost managed to break the Wehrmacht's spine. When the tide turned, Syktyvkar was to be the Front's fallback capital. Their evacuation pushed further north by the Luftwaffe, the remnants of the Red Army have spent a decade licking their wounds and plotting a comeback.\n\nThe communist's intention against Komi are crystal clear. Arkhangelsk sees us as as nothing more than illegitimate separatist rebels. Our recent suppression of the far left has not improved our reputation with them. Already the Red Army plants its invasion of the south. If our republic is to survive, we must prepare to take the war to them. This will be a titanic struggle, for most of the professional soldiers and industry in western Russia are in the Front's hands. We must prepare!"
 NIK_demexpansion_fortress_syktyvkar_desc:0 "Syktyvkar is our greatest city, and one of our greatest assets. We cannot afford to lose its population and industries to the communists, or anyone else.\n\nThe Vychegda river's bank have been chosen as the ultimate defensive position, with forward positions on the far side of the river to delay any attack from the north east. Each crossing has been turned into a miniature, self sufficient fortress. The city's districts themselves are also being fortified, with many civilians having a sentiment of deja-vu as their hometown is once more prepared for violent conflict. Each military command and government office in the city has been given several fall back positions, to ensure continuity of government in the events that parts of the city are overrun. In the suburbs, industrial positions have been fortified, with factory workers and nearby inhabitants trained as emergency firefighters.\n\nSyktyvkar shall be one great fortress, a bulwark against tyranny no matter its source!"
 NIK_demexpansion_establish_the_vychegda_line_desc:0 "The Vychegda river snake along most of our border with the Front. Any direct assault on Syvtykar is likely to require forces on the southern shore of the river, especially if the Red Army attempts to use its tank corps to surround the city. Using the river as a first line of defense is thus a logical step in our preparations for conflict.\n\nA line of machine gun positions and barbed wire on our side of the river will inflict tremendous casualties on any attacking force. Further inland, bunkers and forts will hold mobile troops and artillery able to be redeployed to push any beachhead back into the water. The river will run red with our enemy's blood!"
 NIK_demexpansion_secondary_redoubt_preparation_desc:0 "A defensive line is only worth as much time as it buys for its defenders. Once breached, a series of fortifications can easily be surrounded, trapping its garrison. It is thus important to build reinforced fall back position further south where our men can continue to fight in the event of a breach of the Vychegda line. The Front's commanders will thus have to decide between overrunning every defensive line, or attempt to capture Syktyvkar with exposed flank. Thus, our secondary positions serve crucial roles in defensive as well as in counter-offensive plans."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_red_desc:0 "Our northern frontier is now heavily defended against any Communist violence. Any Red Army aggression will cost it dearly in terms of manpower and materiel. Once the invaders have been repelled, our commanders will be free to follow the broken formations north and attempt our own crossing of the Vychegda river.\n\nWar with the front will be far from easy. But our position is secure. The Front must either defeat us, Vologda or Gayny if they are to expand in western Russia. The communists are bound to run out of patience and make a tactical mistake in their hope of breaking out of the arctic. We've only got to wait long enough to exploit their desperation. And this combination of preparation and strategic patience forms the core of War Plan Red."
 NIK_demexpansion_against_the_monarchists_desc:0 "To the south, monarchists have recreated a miniature Russian Empire in Vyatka. Perhaps it was this later-day white army's intention to cloak itself in history. What better, after all, than a new Romanov tsar to end these modern time of troubles? This historical allusion has not provided much humor to Komi's military thinkers as the monarchist have raised a large army of rabble to this end. The monarchists do not field an army as potent as the Front. But their troops are on the march, and an invasion of Komi is inevitable.\n\nThe Republican Army's generals have thus been preparing both defensive and offensive plans against Vyatka. If the monarchists attack, our soldiers would be more than ready to repel them. If we judge it is time to end their monarchist nonsense, our men will be equally prepared to launch an invasion of the south. The white army's day are numbered."
 NIK_demexpansion_fortress_vilegodsk_desc:0 "Our border with the monarchists follow the Vyatka river. While smaller than the Vychedga river to the north, the Vyatka rivers offers a natural barrier against the whites. The largest city on the river's north bank is Slobodskoy, in south western Komi. From its origin as a small village, the area has seen a population boom as refugees have settled into the young republic and a large military garrison has been established on the southern border. Now the garrison town is being fortified. Slobodskoy will be an important staging point for an invasion of the monarchists, or for any defensive operation along the river's bank. As such, it's a primary necessity to see the city protected from all sides."
 NIK_demexpansion_staff_the_tundra_desc:0 "Winter Operations are an essential part of the toolkit of any Russian commander worth his salt. Right now our men usually winter inside garrison town, with less than a third of our men used to cold weather deployments in rough outposts. Our new deployment scheme will seek to remedy this by giving every rank of soldier training in the outdoors. Once the soldiers are used to operating in winter as in summer, they will possess the capacity to fight whatever the season."
 NIK_demexpansion_hidden_positions_desc:0 "The monarchists will no doubt attempt to cross the Vyatka river and gain a foothold in southern Komi before attempting to march onto our capital. In the events of such a breach of our southern defensive line, possessing hidden cards to play would be to the republic's advantage.\n\nWork has thus been planned for a line of secondary hidden fortification. This network of camouflaged bunker will shelter our troops if they feel the need to fall back to the interior. They will also let us strike at the flank of any army marching on Syktyvkar."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_white_desc:0 "While much of our preparation for Plan White has been defensive in nature, our commanders have still given much thought to the best way to crack the monarchist's defensive lines.\n\nThe monarchists have lost no time industrializing, and the Izhevsk arms factory to the south has equipped their conscripts with good weapons. The most obvious path to victory would be the capture of Kudymkar and its surroundings, the one stretch of the border not covered by rivers. The enemy is likely to know this, and defend the area vigorously. The alternatives are costly attempts at crossing the fortified rivers. Once in enemy territory, sieging the enemy capital of Vyatka to separate its defenders from southern industry would likely be a great tactical victory. Secondary target include Izhevsk and Krasnokamsk. Our men must be ready to pay the price for ultimate victory over the monarchist threat!"
 NIK_demexpansion_the_gayny_contingency_desc:0 "To our east, mad monks have subjugated the Gayny region. Claiming that Russia has been abandoned by the almighty for its sins and decadence, this cabal of maddened mystics has whipped up a mob of peasants into a frenzy. It is very likely that our so-called "godless republic" is next on the monk's chopping block. We must thus prepare contingency plans for a conflict with them.\n\nMilitary authorities have begun reinforcing the eastern regions while our republic's priests and politicians have made joint speeches denouncing Gayny as a mere doomsday cult.\n\nNo matter their goals, these mad monks shall not be given a chance to sabotage our efforts."
 NIK_demexpansion_preempetive_intervention_desc:0 "The president is expected to make a speech to the Republic's parliament informing them that a state of war now exists between Komi and Gayny's theocratic government.\n\nKomi's high command agrees that with the constant threat of invasion by the Front in the north and by monarchists in the south, the continued risk of a Gayny invasion cannot be tolerated. To face a two or three front war at a critical moment would certainly doom the republic.\n\nInvading the theocracy will be no cakewalk, as fanatical soldiers will follow their religious leaders into battle. The Republican Army must prevail, and rapidly, lest it gets bogged down in a war it cannot afford."
 NIK_demexpansion_extend_the_vychegda_line_desc:0 "The long Vychegda river is already at the core of preparations made against the Western Russia Revolutionary Front, or Plan Red. The waterway also snakes its way along the Komi-Gayny frontier. Fortifying it would be a cheap way to deter aggression from the angry theocracy. Were the worst to happen and the monks to attack us while we are busy elsewhere, the lengthened Vychedga line would make it easy for small deployments of border troops to repel the attackers until reinforcements are available for a counter-attack. Thus, the generals have approved additional fortification of the area."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_black_desc:0 "It is always a troubling sight for our eastern troops to see their opposite number dig trenches and prepare staging grounds across the Vychegda rivers. The monk and their warriors are no raging peasant mob, but a well organized militia that is preparing for a conventional conflict crossed with a holy crusade.\n\nBut no amount of preparation can make an under-industrialized army break a reinforced trench line, as the first world war shows. Our men in the east are ready for any eventuality. And when the time comes, their commander hold attack orders for the moment when the Republican Army marches east to restore order."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_vologda_contingency_desc:0 "No matter how our government feels about Vologda, the facts remain that our leaders are prepared for any eventuality. The Vologdan government could collapse, or turn hostile, or fall to invasion. As a result it is good to have some contingency planning for a western war. The usual invasion plans have been drawn up by our commanders, as have a set of recommendations for improved border defences.\n\nNo matter how the Vologdan government feels about us, it will understand our reasoning. In fact, it wouldn't surprise us if they did the very same thing."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_western_line_desc:0 "Particularly important to our defensive problem with Vologda is that our nation share a long border uninterrupted by rivers or wetlands. It will thus be costly but important to see a long line of bunkers, trenches, fortified positions and garrisons created. In the event of fighting in our western lands, these new fortifications, combined with existing or upcoming military outposts designed for plans Red and White will serve as a bulwark for our wester soldiers."
 NIK_demexpansion_expand_border_patrols_desc:0 "Soldiers that know a battlefield well can often win surprising victories through deception and quick thinking. The troops on the western frontier have seen their border patrol efforts expanded. Many of our men that had spent their life in Syktyvkar are discovering the countryside in and around the Vologdan border. While a few grumble at the effort, most seem happy at the opportunity to trade barracks life for extended camping trip around the wester territories."
 NIK_demexpansion_finalize_plan_blue_desc:0 "Our military is now as well equipped for conflict with a "western enemy" as it can reasonably be. It is difficult to gain further military intel without offending the Vologdan government with our espionnage.

Veteran soldiers now stand guard in Arkhangelsk, Vyatka and beyond as Syktyvkar's citizens cheer uproariously in the streets.\n\nThis string of conquest will take some time to adjust to. For now, giving our citizens a breather from total mobilization will help the victory celebrations. We've got much to be proud of!"

We've expelled the communist threat from our Republic, and now the Republican Army shall eradicate the red menace from western Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_execute_plan_white_desc:0 "It is perhaps to the Tsar's credit that he has come back to Russia, rather than live a comfortable soft life in exile.

The Tsar and his cronies wish not for citizens, but for slaves and subjects, abject in their subservience. The Republican Army will instead show him the strength of the Russian nation, for these difficult times have forged a new generation of standard bearers for democracy and decency."

If God has a side then it is definitely ours, the side of compassion and mercy, of hope and courage. To our east, theocrats speak of end times and of the displeasure of the eternal.

Beyond our border lurk more dangers; ambitious tyrants dream of subjugating all of western Russia to their whims. For now, however, we have some time to consolidate. Our enemies held great amount of industrial equipment, war supplies and population. Already the republic has gone from one of the weakest factions to one of the powerhouses of western Russia. If the soldiers have been allowed some rest, our poor bureaucrats are working triple overtime to somehow integrate mountains of resources into a system not designed for population and territory of that magnitude. As their work progresses, our integration of these new assets will give us a significant edge in the upcoming wars."
 NIK_demexpansion_negotiate_with_vologda_desc:0 "It is time to revisit our relationship with our western neighbor. Our first visit to Vologda at the dawn of the unification wars was mainly concerned with military matters, for our young republic was surrounded on three sides with dangerous regimes.\n\nNow that Komi stands tall, we must ask Vologda's government about deeper integration. The men of Vologda are famous for their opposition to wars of aggression against fellow Russian citizens, and now we ask them for help in our grim unification of western Russia. No matter how they felt about us before, the fusion of our two nations is a difficult decision for Vologda's leadership. But Russia long divided must unite again. We can only hope that our neighbors understand this."
 NIK_demexpansion_merge_the_institutions_desc:0 "Today is a glorious day, for Vologda has agreed to peaceful fusion with our nation!\n\nSoldiers that used to belong to the two nations have crossed the border not in conflict, but in celebration as politicians and commanders meet to discuss how best to merge both set of institutions. Battles will be fought not between brothers, but between conflicting bureaucratic standards as torrents of inks are spilled instead of blood. Paper pushers of both nations have sparred verbally, while inwardly cheering at the peaceful nature of this conflict. And outside, people celebrate the good news of the new republic."
 NIK_demexpansion_execute_plan_blue_desc:0 "It is with heavy heart that the officers have received their orders. Plan Blue is to be activated: the invasion and occupation of Vologda.\n\nMorale is projected to be an issue, of course. Republican soldiers are not liberating citizens from despotic regimes, but putting the torch to an independent nation. Propaganda depicting Vologda as a tyrannical regime will likely ring hollow to our men... Yet, military analysts predict the campaign's success. Recruits from beyond Komi's old territory have little reason for friendship with Vologda. Amongst our veterans, dissent or requests for transfer have been few in number. Perhaps the horror of the Russian Anarchy has inured our men to senseless battles."

Vologda's population is outraged at our invasion, and armed resistance continues across much of the territory.\n\nSome carrots will be offered. Much stick will be given. Already a village has been torched after the company of former soldiers they held tried to fight off our men. The village's former citizens have had their day in court, and for their crimes, their lives were forfeit.\n\nLife as a citizen of the republic is better than death at the end of a pointless insurgency campaign. In time the former Vologdans will understand this. They must understand this. They must."

As such, much of our newly acquired resources will be used to deal with whatever warlord has lasted long enough to become one of our neighbors."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_silver_desc:0 "A strange sense of deja-vu comes to mind as our army mobilizes against Berezniki. Claiming not only to be the true communist government, but also to represent the exalted Tsar's true subjects, Kazembek's strange followers disdain our republic. They seek to mend the rift between socialists and monarchists by restoring the tsar as supreme protector of a collection of soviets.\n\nTheir ideology matters less than the army they field against us. This strange red and white army is motivated, organized in a modern fashion, and unafraid of the Republican Army. We cannot afford to let them scheme against us, lest remnants from the Front or Vyatka use them as useful idiots."

None have come up with any logical explanation for this Russian cult of the men who brought our lands to ruin.\n\nIts grotesque ideology put aside for the moment, reports tell of us of another highly motivated army, assisted with militias of less reliable troops. This ersatz Wehrmacht wishes to impose "order" on every slavic "degenerate" they encountered. For all their endless drilling and training, this awful army of soldier cannot be allowed to survive."

There is something to be said for the grandeur of Nikolai Averin's vision: an army of tanks, used for plunder and chaos. It is also admirable that the man's acolytes have mostly reserved their greed toward Moskowien to the west. The time of bandit is drawing to an end, and there is no way to make the men of Gorky see reason. Equipped with tanks and planes, our opponents believe they can dictate us terms, and deny us access to their military factories.\n\nWar with Gorky will take a different characters. Our opponents are mostly Red Army veterans, and are armored to the gills. Anti tank efforts will be crucial, as will good communications. The reward of victory will be Gorky's impressive tank factories, a prize well worth fighting for."
 NIK_demexpansion_plan_violet_desc:0 "The Tatars saw the fall of the WRRF as an opportunity for independence. Rendered paranoid by the successive erosion of their rights under the tsarist and then communist governments, Tatars leaders have infected their citizens with distrust for the outside world. Negotiation with them is futile, and the only thing able to break their independence streak is the force of arms.\n\nThe Tatars are likely to fight tooth and nail our attempt to reimpose order. Our soldiers will have to carefully show the Tatar population that we fight not the Tatars themselves, but their arrogant government. Limiting civilian casualties will be extremely important."
 NIK_demexpansion_negotiate_with_tatarstan_desc:0 "It is true that the Tatars have reasons to distrust Russian interlocutors. Moscow and St-Petersburg have long ignored Tatar issues, content as they were to consign the Turkic people to the wastebasket of history.\n\nOur government is made from better stuff than the Tsar's autocratic or the Soviet dictatorship. Ethnic minorities can thrive in our young nation, and if given the chance by Tatarstan's leadership we can prove it. All we need is some trust and goodwill for the negotiations to open."

Citizens in Komi have rights, and these rights are intrinsic to each citizen. They are not granted at the whim of a Tsar, or a political committee. Freedom of religion is an important value of our republic; surely we can reach a deal with Bashkiria?"

Now that our armies are taking a well earned rest, it is once again time for our public servants to wander into these new territories and catalogue everything. Industrial plants, cities, mines, population centers; all important resources for our growing nation. All this wealth is fed back into the Republican Army, covering equipment and manpower losses, and giving our men new weapons. On the horizon, new enemies. Our men must be equipped for any eventuality."
 NIK_demexpansion_ensure_industrial_preparedness_desc:0 "Building an industrial economy from the ground up using factories taken over in wars of conflict is not a precise science. Many factories that fall in our hands are geared to produce the same things as other industrial areas in our possession. Russian warlords usually function on an autarkic production system that sees everything crafted locally. Conversely, there are many goods that are produced nowhere, as the divided Russian territories did not possess an economy large enough for things beyond basic military weapons.\n\nAll this is beginning to change as we develop an integrated industrial policy prepared for a wide range of scenario and needs. Once rare items are now being produced in large quantities as the republic synergizes its various economic sectors to prevent any future penury of goods. Entire supply chains of complex outputs are reappearing in western Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_secure_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Operational integrity seeks to gather men, methods of doing and materiel into one unified whole. Mechanized tactics cannot exist without supply and logistical regiments. Once in the field, tanks and vehicles are vulnerable to aerial attacks, requiring aerial support of our own. The deployment of costly vehicles and their experienced operators relies on the assumption that neither men nor materiel are in danger of destruction. Thus any deployment also requires an intel corps.\n\nOperational integrity is thus a complex system of simple parts brought together to perform critical military tasks. Our soldiers and generals have integrated every lessons of past conflicts into a new way of doing things. Long before a tank rolls out of our new factories, its purpose is well understood by our military. Our enemy shall learn to fear this oneness of purpose and action."

The law will explicitly ban the possession of heavy weaponry. Equally under target will be automatic weapons, as well as large magazines.\n\nWe will use this law as both a carrot, and a stick. Extremists will be able to sell their weapons in a government buy back if they wish to quit politics, and those who hold on to their illegal weapons will be breaking the law and thus be easy to arrest."

Outside of the army of the Republic, the police, as well as a few state backed militias, belonging to an group will be a criminal offense. Those who cling to their paramilitary membership will be arrested on terrorism charges; those who resist will be shot.\n\nThe designation of all those organizations as terrorist groups will allow us to hit their finances, starving them out of money.

Were we to purge extremism from our army, a great deal of experience would be bled out from the institution.\n\nWe will offer these crooks a deal: fight for us, or be hammered by the law. Any weapon and supplies that are brought from paramilitary control back into official use will be rewarded, and former paramilitaries who prove especially willing to work with us will see their army career given a slight boost."
 NIK_demexpansion_the_vilegodsk_conference_desc:0 "To show our goodwill to the far right and far left, a conference in Vilegodsk has been called to help establish a legal framework of spheres of influences within the republic. Political organizations will be allowed to run schools, unions, news agencies and other such services for their own community, with oversight from the central government.\n\nThe ability to live separately from offensive sociopolitical groups within a clearly defined framework will assuage fears that the central government is one decree away from outlawing personal rights. In return, high level members of sociopolitical groups will be in constant communication and coordination with the central government, all in the spirit of showing loyalty to the Republic and a commitment to keeping the system alive."
 NIK_demexpansion_centralize_redistricting_desc:0 "Woe to the conquered!\n\nOur willingness to cooperate with extremists who recognize their defeat should not be misunderstood for a willingness to turn the other cheek and forget past misdeeds. As such, our government will create a new centralized redistricting office that will be in charge of designing the Republic's electoral constituencies.\n\nUsing this technique we will harvest a bounty of centrist deputies who will help strengthen our grip on the legislative and executive wings of government. This will allow us to pummel renegade extremists, and tempt those willing to compromise to join us at the negotiating table."
 NIK_demexpansion_a_united_army_desc:0 "A United Army"
 NIK_demexpansion_to_arms_desc:0 "Citizens, the Republic stands more united than ever! Once wasting time in pointless bickering and endless bloodshed, the children of the nation stand united and ready to face their enemies. Old rivalries have been ended in the name of stabilizing and expanding the Republic.\n\nNow that fascists and communists soldiers stand side by side with their democratic counterparts, Komi is ready to go on the offense. The experience of our men and the vast scope of personalities and ideas within our army grants us the flexibility needed to tackle any enemy!\n\nAt least, so goes the theory. The extremists have quieted down for now. We can only hope that they keep their end of the bargain, lest internecine squabbles threaten to destroy our Republic once more."
 NIK_demexpansion_peace_for_now_desc:0 "Perhaps just a passing dream? The streets of our capital are quiet, for once. A few families are seen walking about where once thugs manned barricades and checkpoints.\n\nThe police reports echo this anomaly. Peace seems to have descended on Syvtyvkar. A fragile peace perhaps, for the demons of civil strife might return if we are not vigilant. A fragile peace, if our rivals in western Russia try to end our democratic experiment. A peace, nonetheless, and one we intend to defend by force.\n\nCitizens, much remains to be done. We must be vigilant, so that our nation's future is not dashed against the rocks of war nor the chaos of internal conflict."
 NIK_demexpansion_a_new_democratic_foundation_desc:0 "The Republic, once seeing its electoral system frayed and closing down due to extremism, must see democracy flourish again.\n\nRegenerating the interest and trust our citizens have in the democratic process will be tough, especially coming on the tail end of our efforts to end political extremism once and for all. We must accomplish this nevertheless, if the democratic center's power is to be assured.\n\nLetting go of our power to design electoral districts now that they have been sanitized will help restore confidence. As will the ability to call snap elections to remove governments that are wildly unpopular with the electorate. Finally, propaganda campaigns extolling the virtue of engaged citizens will hopefully draw crowds once more to polling stations."
 NIK_demexpansion_new_election_cycles_desc:0 "Now that the Republic's bases are strong and secure, it is time to turn a new leaf.\n\nNew elections taking place in the rationalized and cleansed political arena will be scheduled. It is perhaps a risky move to entrust the fate of our project to the citizens. No riskier, however, than ruling in content of majority to further the end of small political cliques like our enemies in the far left and far right intended to do.\n\nOur new electoral cycle is set to hold election around the time our army and diplomatic service is set to have reunited many regions of western Russia. Holding an election in freshly annexed or liberated territory must be difficult. But through this our new citizens will see our commitment to democratic ideals!"
 NIK_demexpansion_formalize_our_claims_desc:0 "Our enemies in the Revolutionary Front call us secessionists and traitors. The Tsar in Vyatka and his cronies dismiss us as the Syktyvkar clique. Others use our official name of the Komi Republic, seeing us as a mere local curiosity standing in their projects of uniting western Russia.\n\nThose names will be relegated to the past. Our government prepares a new declaration, announcing that we alone have the legitimacy to rule all of Russia as the Russian Republic. All of our institutions are to change to reflect this. Territory occupied by our military will merely be territory returning to our rightful rule. Diplomatic annexations will be undertaken under the auspices of bringing rogue provincial governors and usurpers back under the fold of the reborn Russian Republic.\n\nOur regional rivals are not likely to take this seriously. As such, we must be ready to prove our claims through force of arm... or through the silver-tongue of our diplomats. Nevertheless, the world shall know that the Russian Republic, killed by the Bolsheviks, is back!"
 NIK_demexpansion_the_constitutional_convention_desc:0 "Our status as the true Russian Republic imposes on us a rewriting of our Constitution. Befitting our democratic beliefs, it is important to initiate a constitutional convention, and invite all those who seek to contribute to our constitution in good faith.\n\nThere is much work to be done, and many sources to analyse. Flawed as they were, the constitutions of the late imperial regime, of Kerensky's failed republic, and of the Soviet Union itself are all sources of ideas. Each of the ruling coalition's democratic parties are likely to have good suggestions. We can also expect reformed extremists to attend. Their best ideas must be entertained, and those that were once our rivals will now become our friend in the rebirth of Russia."
 NIK_demexpansion_declare_the_free_republic_desc:0 "Men and women of the Republic, arise!\n\nFrom the Ural mountains on to the black mark of Moskowien, your fellow citizens everywhere are divided, enslaved by capricious tyrants or huddled in fragile statelets, awaiting liberation.\n\nAs the restored Russian Republic, our first aim is to unite western Russia into a new West Russian Free Republic. This does not shirk from our ambitions to free all of Russia, but rather confirm it! Once the greatest population centers that are free from German occupation are ours, our Republic will march east, to the Pacific!\n\nThe Tsarists, and the Communists of the Front, and the despicable dogs of the so called Army of Russian Liberation, let them all cower! The army of free men is on the march!"

 NIK_stalexpansion_restoring_order_desc:0 "The struggle for Russian reunification has begun, with territory after territory falling under our control. Yet even as we fight to rebuild our country, we are hampered by the political chaos of the Komi Republic, where extremists on either side of politics seek to take power by terroristic means. Even in our new territories, unrest and radicalism simmer. Russia cries out for true leadership. Thankfully, there is a woman with the talent, vision, and strength to seize the reigns of history and restore order in our fractured nation: Svetlana Stalina."
 NIK_stalexpansion_devolve_judicial_power_desc:0 "The judicial process in Komi is fair, but also inefficient and slow. With so many radicals opposing our government, and so many trials to process, reforms have to be made. President Stalina has authorized the powers of the judicial courts to be extended to the police precincts and military. This will allow for the police and military to set up courts of their own, so that extremists and criminals can be dealt with quickly and efficiently. While some may call this undemocratic, and fear that this will be used to purge anyone who disagrees with the government, it is simply the only way to proceed. Once the crisis has passed, we can discuss this matter in more depth."
 NIK_stalexpansion_arrest_sources_of_information_desc:0 "While many of the world's democracies enshrine freedoms such as the freedom of speech as sacred and untouchable constructs, they have their downsides. President Stalina does not despise freedom of speech, she merely wishes to ensure the survival of the Republic. As such, using an executive directive, the freedom of speech shall be suspended entirely, so that it may not be abused by radicals to spread hate and strife.\n\nThis is merely a temporary measure, and these legal protections shall be returned once the crisis is under control, we assure you."
 NIK_stalexpansion_make_an_example_desc:0 "Our government has recently captured several extremist paramilitaries, whose ideologies have cost the lives of countless innocent souls. They continued to spread hate and destruction within our Republic, and are complicit in the cycle of coups that President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are attempting to end. They must be made an example, an example of the punishment reserved for spreading hate and discord, for propagating extremism and violence.\n\nTheir trials shall be quick, expedited through our new judicial policies. We shall line up these communists and fascists against a wall and eradicate their hatred from this world. May God have mercy on their souls."
 NIK_stalexpansion_seize_unregistered_firearms_desc:0 "As we have waged our war to reunite Russia and vanquish the warlords, we have increasingly found that many civilians in our newly acquired territories possess their own firearms. Russia has been a dangerous place in recent times, and we would not deprive our citizens of the right to arm themselves for protection and self-defence. Yet in the wrong hands, these weapons could pose a threat to our brave soldiers. We shall have to conduct background checks on the citizen population, making sure there are none with extremist sympathies hiding in our midst, seizing the firearms of any who poses a threat. They will be much more useful in the hands of our men."
 NIK_stalexpansion_clear_the_streets_desc:0 "Street protests, violent crime, and other civil disturbances continue to plague our cities at precisely the time the campaign to restore Russia to greatness requires order and discipline. It is time to put a stop to such nonsense, by any means necessary. We will deploy the police, our greatest defence against anarchy, across the cities of Russia, and put an end to the chaos. Those who resist will be met with the full force of the law. Some will complain about the stripping of their liberties, but such people do not know that freedom can only be built on the basis of a secure, orderly society. They will learn."
 NIK_stalexpansion_the_crisis_calmed_desc:0 "Thankfully, due to all of our efforts to remove extremist ideas from our republic the immediate crisis seems to have been calmed. However, there are still many radicals who may try to seize power as we expand into more territories. Similarly, as we come to control regions that were once under communist or despotist rule, we may be at risk of a partisan uprising. These territories that have never known democracy may not be in favor of our government. We should continue our efforts to educate these people and eliminate the threats of radicals and partisans, and we will not stop until our republic is secured."
 NIK_stalexpansion_the_national_reconstruction_council_desc:0 "President Stalina needs a group of people to aid her in stabilizing Komi, and has found her solution in the form of the National Reconstruction Council. Its members consist of PSD politicians, police commanders, trade union leaders, and military officers, serving as an upper house of sorts for the Reconstruction Government. The Council will propose and pass policy during this time of crisis, give advice and consent to decisions made by the President, and have sole authority to ratify treaties. The National Reconstruction Council shall act as a parallel body to the National Assembly, but will be more reliable due to all of the members being appointed directly by the President herself."
 NIK_stalexpansion_guarantees_to_the_national_assembly_desc:0 "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. Some have even gone so far as to call President Stalina a dictator, and anti-democratic. What these critics don't seem to understand is that these are all temporary protective measures, to ensure that the Republic does not fall once again.\n\nTo combat these claims, President Stalina shall take a break from her busy schedule to promise that the National Assembly's power shall be returned shortly, and that the Reconstruction Government will be disbanded once the crisis has passed. Hopefully, this will end their useless panicking."
 NIK_stalexpansion_extend_emergency_powers_desc:0 "Numerous deputies, mostly from the SMR and DSNP, within the National Assembly have expressed concern over some of the Reconstruction Government's more... direct policies, and the current suspension of the Constitution. President Stalina has decided to refuse to guarantee the temporary nature of these policies, seeing it as unnecessary and a distraction from her busy schedule. Instead, President Stalina has chosen to extend her emergency powers indefinitely, and she will cease using them once they are no longer necessary. The Reconstruction Government operates on a need-to-know basis, and currently, that is all the National assembly needs to know. If they have a problem with this information, President Stalina suggests submitting a complaint to the National Reconstruction Council, who will address such complaints once there is enough time available to do so."
 NIK_stalexpansion_issue_the_fundamental_directives_desc:0 "The Republic of Komi is beset on all sides by extremists, radicals and rabble-rousers who seek to undermine the stability of the nation, planning to destroy the rights of the common man in favour of building twisted "utopias" based on their ideas. This ends now. Only by issuing a series of Fundamental Directives that order their arrests and removals from society can we restore the stability that they destroyed. Who is an extremist will be decided later- what matters now is that they must be eliminated."
 NIK_stalexpansion_liquidate_anti_democratic_apparatus_desc:0 "With the continued consolidation of the Republic, it has become clear to the Reconstruction Government that democracy may not be restored promptly without more and more decisive action. The time for legislation and temporary police crackdowns is over - the time has come. We must rid ourselves of the Far-Left and the Far-Right, for good. Their members will be arrested. No matter how large they are, or irrelevant, they will be annihilated."
 NIK_stalexpansion_a_blueprint_for_integration_desc:0 "The more the Republic expands, the more difficult it is for us to properly integrate these new territories into the central government- that is, unless we come up with a distinct plan on how to train and send in new administrators into these territories in a swift but orderly manner. New departments and governments will need to be set up as soon as our armies conquer them, while leaders from regions peacefully incorporated into the state must be integrated into the government of Komi as soon as possible in order to create a stable platform for expansion."
 NIK_stalexpansion_democracy_is_non_negotiable_desc:0 "Nothing is more sacred on this green Earth than the right for people to take part in the government, but despots and extremists refuse to recognise this. Hence, it is by the guns and tanks of the Komi Army that the light of democracy is carried to the furthest depths of Russia. Hence, we must issue an ultimatum to all the tyrannies and despotates that we encounter on the road to reunification: accept integration into the Republic, or war. Democracy is non-negotiable, and these thugs must learn this lesson the hard way, if need be."
 NIK_stalexpansion_the_road_to_enduring_freedom_desc:0 "The protection of liberty and democracy in the Republic was long and difficult; some agitators even claim that our methods go against the ideals that we have uphold so dearly. We cannot listen to these rabble-rousers. Since the inception of our nation, the freedom that is so much a part of Komi's identity was besieged by extremists within and without, and it will continue to be so for the foreseeable future. As long as it is under attack, we must endure that long road to freedom, facing whatever obstacle comes in our way with courage and determination."

 NIK_fashexpansion_the_state_secured_desc:0 "With the end of the weak Repubic, and the instatement of our new order under the combined banner of the Passionariyy, the time has come to begin the reclamation of western Russia. The consolidation of Ust-Sysolsk under our new order, thus, will begin immediately, until we are capable of shattering any enemy that dares move against us, be they internal or external.\n\nOur foes are many, but our people are strong, and, if all else fails, the arsenals belong Syktyvkar can always be pressed into service for the true Russian state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_unearth_the_arsenals_desc:0 "Throughout our lands, there lie vast arsenals of weaponry that have been buried in bunkers, to protect them from German bombers. The arsenal beneath Syktyvkar, and its chemical stockpiles, is the greatest example of this, but there exists many other such stockpiles. We must unearth these caches immediately, and arm our forces with their contents. A well-armed force is critical for the expansion of our state, and the impending reclamation of Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_secure_reliable_infrastructure_desc:0 "One could say that the Republic made a strong effort to deter the bombers, and repair the roads that they damaged. One could also be entirely wrong. The state of the infrastructure throughout Ust-Sysolsk is utterly dismal, with numerous trade routes and valuable paved roads completely ignored by the old government, in favor of investing more money into government corruption, failed welfare programs, and grandiose, unworkable projects.\n\nWe must rectify this situation at once, repairing old infrastructure and constructing new roads to move goods faster, and allow our soldiers to redeploy more effectively."
 NIK_fashexpansion_assemble_our_forces_desc:0 "There exist elements within our state that are sympathetic to our goals and motivations, yet were forbidden from gaining crucial military experience by the previous government. We will rectify this, as well, and expand our recruitment to those that formerly would have been discharged for 'radicalism' and 'disloyalty' by the old Republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_reform_a_true_army_desc:0 "Despite everything we have done, our armament programs and recruitment programs, an army is nothing but a mob of ill-organized rabble without competent officers and quality training. We must assemble our army's high command and consult the officers of the Republican Army who have remained loyal to us, for a comprehensive new program of training and disciplining our forces."
 NIK_fashexpansion_oaths_of_loyalty_desc:0 "There is an important question vexing the political apparatus of the state, and the military apparatus alike. This question regards the oaths of loyalty that each soldier is to take. The old Republic had a set of oaths dedicated to protecting and upholding democracy, the Republic, and the Komi Constitution, which will clearly not do. However, the factions that make up our current government are conflicted as to which form the new oaths shall take.\n\nThe more monarchist-inclined groups wish to restore the Tsarist oaths, swearing loyalty to a crown and throne that are currently vacant. The more mainsteam elements of the government, on the other hand, wish to reword the old Republican oaths to fit our newer, stronger state. There are even some elements within the state that view the Soviet oaths, and their commitment to ideology, as a possible model. The Army must come to a decision, to ensure the loyalty of our troops, and a united military."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_anti_bolshevik_pact_desc:0 "The state of Vyatka, under the Tsar Vladimir III, is not an ideal ally. Indeed, in a less desperate situation, it would be considered an enemy to strike down as soon as possible. However, we do not have the luxury of such an idyllic situation. With the growing red storm to our north, we must approach the pretender Tsar, for the good of both of us. Only once the Reds are defeated, may we have the luxury of reconsidering our foreign policy situation.\n\nWe must approach Vyatka with a proposed Anti-Bolshevik Pact, for mutual defense and shared training, until the sacred task of casting down the communists is completed."
 NIK_fashexpansion_better_than_the_reds_desc:0 "Vladimir has pulled through for us, and revealed himself as at least a semi-decent ally of our cause. He has agreed to commit to our Anti-Bolshevik Pact, and begin cooperating with our state for the purpose of putting down the Front... at least for the time being."
 NIK_fashexpansion_officer_exchanges_desc:0 "Our officers have faced different conditions to those of the Tsarists, and have served on the frontline in border raids against the Reds, in many cases. Our practical experience is a boon to us, but the Whites to our south have the theoretical advantage, having fought in the West Russian War against the Front on the grand scale. We have fought the communists in the present, and they have fought them in the past - there is much to learn on both of our ends. Let us share this knowledge with our partners against the red menace."
 NIK_fashexpansion_joint_army_maneuvers_desc:0 "Our doctrine has its strengths, but also its flaws. The more experienced units of Vyatka, thankfully, are willing to help rectify the issues present in our training, supply chain, and combat techniques. While their aid is to be viewed with suspicion, of course, what useful knowledge they provide is precious, and is to be taken seriously. If Vyatka can help us fill the holes in our army's pool of skill, its aid is to be greatly appreciated."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_civil_war_relived_desc:0 "The days of the Civil War were dark for our nation, setting the stage for the eventual national disintegration of our great country into what it is today. However, we now have a chance to reverse it. With the aid of Vyatka, we shall be able to strike back and vanquish the Reds which destroyed Russia, and erase all traces of communism in our nation. The time is now - the only question is who will set the Reds' demise into motion. Their foolish action... or our triumphant initiative."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_pretenders_betrayal_desc:0 "Typical. The false Tsar of Vyatka has rejected our pact, and decried us as fascists and traitors to Russia. Clearly, he has forgotten who is the fell and base Nazi collaborator, and who is the true Russian patriot. This betrayal, while it may seem mortal, shall not cripple us. We must rely only on our own strength and will, and through this, we will triumph over all who dare oppose us."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_propaganda_offensive_desc:0 "Clearly, the supposed Tsar has proven himself an enemy of our state, and by extension, an enemy of all the peoples of Russia. Through a repurposing of our broadcast infrastructure, and the abundance of print shops in our cities, we will begin a propaganda offensive against him, and his cruel, backwards regime. The Russian people must be lead to realize that the state in Vyatka is not the future of Russia - it is a relic of a dark, ineffectual past, little better than the Reds themselves!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_recognize_eurasian_strength_desc:0 "Our state is situated in a strategically useful area, with abundant resources, population, and industry. The communists, as evil as they are, after all, would not have made Ust-Sysolsk their temporary capital without reason. We must remind our people of this - that we are strong, that our soldiers are the greatest in Russia, with the will to protect their families and the nation that they love. We do not need allies, for allies are mere temporary, transient things, in the shifting mass of allegiances that is the new Russia. No - it is best to stand on our own, and strive out against the dark!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_ring_of_steel_desc:0 "There is no single defense plan that is sufficient to defend Ust-Sysolsk from all of the threats that surround us. With the hostile Tsar in the south, the erratic fanatics of Gayny to the East, the liberals to the West, and the Front practically on the doorstep of our capital, we must seek a single all-encompassing solution to our defensive woes.\n\nAnd that solution shall come in the form of a ring of steel. A vast network of fortifications must be constructed around our frontier, to defend our state from attack. While we do not have the resources to form a strong, consecutive string of fortifications, we shall be able to construct enough small border forts to ensure that attacks are greatly dissuaded. Ust-Sysolsk shall be secure from attack, from any angle, leaving us free to plot our grand reclamation of Russia."
 NIK_fashexpansion_eurasia_awaits_desc:0 "We have prepared enough, going through all of the preliminary strokes of diplomacy and armament. Now, is the time for expansion, and the reunification of the Motherland. Russia awaits, with her west open for our taking - there lies only our enemies standing in our way. They are many, and we are few, but with the will of the Russian people on our side, alongside our connections and our formidable arsenal, our state shall emerge triumphant, and reclaim her fair lands.\n\nWith our preparations complete, the only thing left to do is issue our orders to our diplomats and generals, and prepare for the greatest string of conflict that we shall face yet."
 NIK_fashexpansion_demand_gaynys_submission_desc:0 "The Order Of Saint George has a cause that one may consider righteous - to honor God, and to oppose the anarchy that has consumed the Motherland. However, they are insular, radical, and unwilling to cooperate with outsiders, viewing them as insufficiently pious at best, and outright heretical at worst. For better or for worse, we must end this policy, by force, and issue an ultimatum to the monks of the Squirrel's Nest Fortress - submit to our state, and be free to practice their religion within our borders, following our laws, or face our armies on the battlefield."
 NIK_fashexpansion_embrace_the_church_desc:0 "With the Gayny settlement under our control, and the Order now within our jurisdiction, now is a prime opportunity to set a precedent for our future religious policy. As always, the factions within our government are split on this issue, with a wide range of theories stretching from cracking down on religion to embracing the Orthodox Church as a central pillar of Russian culture. Throughout our state, other religious groups are looking to our policy on this issue as a guideline towards what they, too, should expect in the future from our government's policies."
 NIK_fashexpansion_rebuild_the_monestaries_desc:0 "Although the monasteries and fortresses controlled by the Order were grand, not even they were immune to the ravages of war and the bombings. Throughout the long decades of shame experienced by Russia, the churches and monasteries of Gayny have stood strong, but have not escaped entirely unscathed.\n\nAs a show of goodwill towards the Order of Saint George, and towards the Orthodox Church in general, the more traditionalist elements of our government have advocated for a comprehensive program to rebuild the religious architecture of Gayny. The reception of this plan has been mixed, with more modernist elements railing against it as a waste of valuable resources."
 NIK_fashexpansion_anti_bolshevik_maneuvers_desc:0 "The West Russian Revolutionary Front, to our north, represents the greatest threat to our state, and the successful creation of a Russia free of communist influence. However, the likelihood that we will be able to cast it down right away is insufficient to make our generals entirely certain. To this end, we must determine a policy towards our consolidation of the region - securing a barrier against the Front's expansion, before striking it down, or launching a pre-empetive attack while the Front is distracted with other matters."
 NIK_fashexpansion_consolidate_the_bloc_desc:0 "We must choose to delay our strike on the Front, and instead target the 'neutral' state of Vologda that lies to our west. By striking at Vologda, we will be able to lock down everything south of the Front's current territories, starving the communists and preventing them from bringing any more of Russia under their hateful influence. Additionally, we will be capable of using the resources of the city for our own purposes, for the future reclamation of the West."
 NIK_fashexpansion_ultimatum_to_the_neutrals_desc:0 "The state of Vologda presents an interesting dilemma for our generals. It has a decent army, although not as strong as the Front itself, yet it is, at least formally, apolitical. Our strategists have deemed it as possibly having sympathies with our cause of a communist-free Russia, but possibly opposed to our 'extremist' ideology. Thus, it is at least worth an attempt at diplomacy. Putting our best foot forward, we will send an ultimatum to Vologda, offering them compensation for unification with our state, and significant investments in their region. If they do not accept our generous offer, of course, there will be trouble..."
 NIK_fashexpansion_cast_down_democracy_desc:0 "Vologda has been secured, whether it be by penstroke or gunshot. Now, there lies the task of casting down the 'democratic' institutions of the former city-state, much as we dissolved the same weakened, backwards institutions in our own state. Our promises to the people of Vologda will stand... to an extent, but we must alter the deal regarding their level of autonomy within our state. We will have no tolerance for potential havens of liberalism, within our very borders."
 NIK_fashexpansion_pre_empetive_strike_desc:0 "As tempting of a target that it is, the WRRF must be our primary objective for attack. Allowing it to consolidate itself any further is unacceptable from a strategic standpoint - with the level of disarray it finds itself in at the moment, we could find ourselves able to defeat it as easily as the Germans shattered Bukharin's Union in the second world war. The men must be prepared - we have no time to waste."
 NIK_fashexpansion_strike_the_front_desc:0 "Everything is ready. Our guns are loaded, our tanks are fuelled, and our men are aware of our plans to tear down the communist abomination.

 NIK_fashexpansion_purge_the_last_remnants_desc:0 "The Front has been cast down, but our work against Bolshevism does not end here. Throughout Arkhangelsk, there lies legions of officers and commissars, some of whom who have fought to spread the Red plague through Russia since before Bukharin's defeat. There is only one option - we must neutralize their influence, forever and always, to ensure that Bolshevism never returns to our lands. There is to be only two possible fates for Reds - a cold cell, or hot lead."
 NIK_fashexpansion_mop_up_the_spare_desc:0 "In our dash to consolidate power in our region, we have been forced to prioritize one threat over the other. The threat we have mercifully ignored has continued to exist... until now.

 NIK_fashexpansion_dissolve_the_pact_desc:0 "With the Reds gone and buried, our pact with the Tsar to the south has outlived its usefulness. Vyatka no longer represents a possible ally, but rather a rival for regional supremacy. The pact must be formally dissolved at once, and our forces prepared to strike south at a moment's notice.\n\nVladimir, of course, does not need to know about this until the time comes."
 NIK_fashexpansion_topple_the_tsar_desc:0 "The time has come to strike south, finally, and secure the fertile lands of Vyatka. The Tsar, the pretender Vladimir III, may pretend that his army is a pre-eminent power, but we know the truth, from careful observation. The White Army is tired, with outdated tactics and aging generals - the time for the old empire has long since passed on.\n\nThere can be no peace or compromise with this symbol of the distant, shameful past - there is only to be a swift strike over the Vyatka River, bringing an end to the last relic of the Russian Civil War."
 NIK_fashexpansion_indulge_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Despite the shameful state of Vyatka, and the treacherous nature of the false Tsar Vladimir, the ideology of monarchism is hardly discredited as a viable means of governing Russia. Sergey Taboritsky and his monarchist faction, while quite divergent from the rest of our front, are influential nonetheless, and advocate strongly for preserving and protecting the history of the Tsardom.\n\nTo indulge Taboritsky and his followers, we could place several of his supporters in high administrative positions in the newly conquered territories of Vyatka, with Taboritsky himself as the local governor. While this will most certainly allow him to gain power, influence, and support amongst the people, could it be worth it to ensure that the holy traditions of Russia are preserved, protected, and rightfully revered?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_crownlands_are_eurasian_desc:0 "With Vyatka captured, and its vast population now under our guiding hand, the time has come to incorporate and integrate the territory. Officials must be tested for loyalty, taxes must be collected, bandits and holdouts must be eliminated, and censuses must be conducted. Only once this long process of integration is complete, can we hope to see the full potential of our latest conquest finally realized."
 NIK_fashexpansion_relocate_the_capital_desc:0 "Our current capital, Ust-Sysolsk, has great benefits. It is far from the frontlines, in a strategic location, and has years and years of administrative framework dating from the days of the WRRF and all the way to the dawn of the new state. However, another option exists, one that has been realized by the newly integrated region of Vyatka.\n\nThe city of Vyatka itself would make an excellent new capital for our state, hosting all of the ministries and infrastructure that were used by the Tsar to manage his realm. It lies in a central location, with a large and fairly loyal population, and is on a much more conveniently located river, for ease of transportation. To move the government is a daunting task, and some may say impractical at this point in time, but with our state's newfound strength, it can surely be realized easily."
 NIK_fashexpansion_secure_the_border_desc:0 "Along the long and porous border of the German occupation zone, numerous states have sprung up, forming a clear western flank to secure against potential German invasion. We should prioritize securing this border strip and eliminating the various warlords that pose easy routes for a German incursion into Russia's heartland. Only we can be trusted to effectively defend against the German scourge, and our rhetoric towards the warlords of the West must reflect this."
 NIK_fashexpansion_punish_the_pirates_desc:0 "The city of Nizhny Novgorod, on the intersection of the mighty Volga and the Oka rivers, is an absolutely crucial strategic asset and population center, forming a veritable lynchpin for any who wish to have a serious chance of unifying Russia. Its tank factories will be critical for striking down stronger foes in the future, and its population will be an invaluable asset.\n\nThis, however, can only be achieved by capturing the city in the first place. Currently, the city and its vast industry are controlled by a glorified gang of bandits and communists, who have dedicated themselves to raiding their neighbors, and growing fat on their spoils. This, however, can be used to our advantage. A message shall be sent to Averin, the leader of the Gorky bandits. Stand down and hand over the city, and he will be rewarded with further riches. Refuse to surrender, and he will be shot like a dog."
 NIK_fashexpansion_absorb_the_tank_fleet_desc:0 "The fleet of assembled tanks and support elements is considered by many of our generals to be the true prize of Nizhny Novgorod - a vast reserve of armored power that can be deployed against our future foes. The bandits controlling the city before us at least had the foresight to hire competent personnel to arm them, and keep the factories running. We will profit from this by extension, and mobilize the motorpool of Nizhny Novgorod for the purpose of our state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_control_their_factories_desc:0 "Whereas the current personnel running the factories of Nizhny Novgorod are at least semi-competent, they are hardly loyal to us and only us. A less charitable state could denounce them as a pack of mercenaries loyal only to profit. In light of this, some changes in their management must be pursued. Rather than following the logic of the bandits' market, the heavy industry of Nizhny Novgorod must be put under direct control, for the purpose of aiding our sacred task to reunify the Motherland."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_tatar_ultimatum_desc:0 "While the Tatars have seceded from the Motherland, they have reason to do so. After all, the Soviet Union was atrocious towards the Turkic population, attempting to stamp out their passionarity and ensure their servitude. Gumilyov has proposed a plan to appeal to the Tatars, with a formal diplomatic request. If they join our state, they shall join us as equals, and have their culture honored as one that is developed and mighty in its own right. If they refuse, however, we will have no choice but to send in the tanks. We are merciful, of course, but we cannot tolerate opposition."
 NIK_fashexpansion_break_the_tatars_desc:0 ""Tatarstan" is nothing but another rightful province within Russia, and the Tatars are merely Russians that have refused to assimilate. Through a swift and decisive invasion of the renegade Tatar state, we will be able to put an end to this separatist nonsense, and secure the city of Kazan as a crucial component of our new Russian state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_measure_of_respect_desc:0 "As fellow peoples of the steppe, and fellow conquerors, we hold a special kinship with the Tatars. Together, we have existed for centuries, travelling across the vast plains of Eurasia. While they are not Russian, they are our fellows and companions, and must be respected as such. The Tatars will be given their own autonomy within our state, where their culture may be conserved. Our passionarity is akin, and so our races are kin."
 NIK_fashexpansion_russians_in_all_but_name_desc:0 "The Tatars are conquered once more, and once more their separatist urges are defeated. What the region of 'Tatarstan' truly needs is not autonomy or recognition, but rather a total integration. Kazan, and the lands around it, will be incorporated into our new state wholesale. There is to be no native autonomy, for why should there be? The Tatars are merly Russians that have lost their way, and their culture is merely a relic of their collective delusion."
 NIK_fashexpansion_ghosts_of_the_war_desc:0 "The Russian Liberation Army, a German construction of the West Russian War, has found their home in the city of Samara, and permeated the region like a cancer. While they may claim to possess ideals compatible with ours, or indeed compatible with the Russian people at all, they are nothing but traitors and German lapdogs.\n\nVlasov has committed the greatest possible violation of the Motherland's honor, by serving those who wish to see the Russian people themselves cast down and reduced to a state below that of animals. For this, the ROA deserves nothing but swift and total destruction. Our armies are ready. Let their wrath descend upon Samara, and shatter the traitors once and for all."
 NIK_fashexpansion_scour_samara_desc:0 "Samara is ours, and with it, we have secured miles upon miles of fruitful land, dozens of factories, and arsenals overflowing with useful equipment. However, we have also inherited another, less valuable thing. Traitors.\n\nSympathizers with the Russian Liberation Army, and the Germans, fill our newly occupied territory, and their partisans continue to fight our forces in many areas. The solution to this problem is simple. A grand crackdown on this treason, and no mercy for any poor fool who dares carry on the cause of a dead traitor."
 NIK_fashexpansion_push_to_the_urals_desc:0 "The Urals are the natural far eastern border of this first phase of our expansion, with the exception of the unassailable Vorkuta. A selection of petty warlords dares to exist along the lines of the mountains, relying on the natural barriers and isolation to protect them from true contenders such as our state.\n\nNo longer. We will sweep south, along the grand mountain range, and secure our eastern border from those that wish to attack from the lands of the fell West Siberian People's Republic."
 NIK_fashexpansion_slaughter_the_syncretists_desc:0 "The Mladorossi may be incomprehensible to the uneducated, but we are no simplistic peasants. We are aware of their true leanings - their complex ideology that values national strength, tradition, and rapid development. They are not communists, who we must oppose, nor backwards, mindless monarchists, but rather represent an ideology that could do great things in practice. Kazembek is a reasonable man - we shall send him a diplomatic request, and offer a position within our government in exchange for his full cooperation in the integration of Berezniki into our reformed state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_welcome_the_true_fascists_desc:0 "Our appraisal of the Mladorossi was correct, it seems, and the integration of Berezniki into our state is projected to go by without a hitch. The ideology of the Mladorossi continues to be a fascinating element, one that is quite appealing to many within our state, especially the followers of Taboritsky. The development of Berezniki can be greatly hastened by leaving its administration more or less untouched, and allowing the current government to exist with only minimal oversight."
 NIK_fashexpansion_purge_the_crypto_socialists_desc:0 "It seems that our generous appraisal of the Mladorossi was granted too soon. The Mladorossi have resisted every attempt to negotiate, and bring them into the fold, after our occupation of Berezniki and comparatively light-handed treatment of their organization. No longer. Kazembek and his highest officials shall be arrested and imprisoned, with trials broadcast over radio. This will serve as a warning to the rest of the Mladorossi - cease their organization against our regime, or face the same fate."
 NIK_fashexpansion_death_to_the_racial_traitors_desc:0 "Centered around the city of Perm lies quite possibly the most abominable foe we have ever faced. Unlike the ROA, who have only betrayed the Russian nation, the so-called "Aryans" of Perm have slandered, spat on, and dishonored everything that it means to be Russian. They denounce their true race as degenerate and subhuman, instead aspiring to the alleged heights of the hated conqueror that has struck our nation down to such a low status. There can be no mercy in return for this insult - we must mobilize our armies, and strike down this abomination, to save the very souls of the people trapped under the false "Aryan" yoke."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_second_purification_desc:0 "The Aryan Brotherhood claimed that they had 'purified' their lands, removing the stain of the 'untermensch' and instating a new order under their enlightened rule. This is, of course, mere delusion. The city of Perm and the lands around it have been stripped bare of their character, and the peoples of the region have been abused and enslaved by the "Aryans". We must aid the region, liberating the people from their chains, prosecuting the leaders of the damned cult, and installing a completely new local administration. The crimes which one must commit to be considered Aryan are a clear tell-tale that none of the Brotherhood's members are to be trusted. Thankfully, now, they will forever bear the marks of shame."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_bashkir_ultimatum_desc:0 "Similarly to the Tatars, the Bashkirs are another Turkic ethnicity that has historically lived alongside the Russian people since time immemorial. They possess a strong sort of passionarity, akin to those of Russians. Despite our differences, we were meant to be bound together, and so, we will dispatch a diplomatic mission to Ufa. If the Bashkirs are wise, they will accept our offer of union without resistance, and join us in the halls of history. If they foolishly refuse, there will be no other option but war."
 NIK_fashexpansion_our_turkic_brethren_desc:0 "The lands of Bashkiria are once more returned to us, firmly under our rightful control. In the process of integrating the region, assigning administrators, and beginning censuses, we must remember the most important component of dealing with our companion races - respect for their traditions, and co-existence as fellow peoples of Eurasia, and the steppes. Our passionarity is alike, and with them, we are stronger than we would be alone."
 NIK_fashexpansion_end_the_bashkir_heresy_desc:0 "The so-called independent republic of Bashkiria is nothing but a separatist fantasy, an illegitimate state carved out of the territory of what is rightfully Russian. Its Islamist nature is contrary to the very nature of the Russian civilization, and the separatist nationalism held by its peoples is an affront to our sensibilities. Bashkiria will be rightfully taken into Russia once more, through bullet and bomb, fire and sword."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_unitary_russia_desc:0 "The state of Bashkiria is once more within our grasp, and its armies have been routed before our superior firepower. All that is left to do now is to integrate the former Bashkiria as a new province within the new Russian state. The new administrative unit shall be named Ufa Oblast. A replacement of the administration shall follow, with Russian-language curriculum instated, and a census run to determine the exact population and demographic composition of the region. The mistakes of the past in dealing with the Bashkirs will not be repeated."
 NIK_fashexpansion_restoration_day_desc:0 "Today, the most momentous occasion in the history of our new state has arrived - the day of the reunification of the territories West of the Urals. Through our labor, blood, and diplomatic efforts, all of west Russia has finally come under the control of our new state. Our vast lands extend from Arkhangelsk to Samara, with a loyal and proud population millions strong. For this achievement, the end of warlordism and Bolshevism in our lands, a national holiday shall be declared, and parades held in all of our major cities.\n\nTruly, today is the first step in the rise of a new, proud Russia - it is the day of the beginning of the end of the enemies of the Motherland!"
 NIK_fashexpansion_lessons_from_unification_wars_desc:0 "The enemies we faced in the re-unification wars to restore West Russia were varied in their tactics, ideologies, and equipment. From the deep battle of the communists, to the manuever warfare of the ROA, we have faced every doctrine that could be thrown against us, and we have emerged victorious. However, this does not mean we should grow complicit. There is always more to learn, from our defeated foes, and integrating techniques and tactics from past enemies could help us refine our formal strategies even further. The general who does not adapt to changing paradigms, after all, is doomed to fall to a general that does."
 NIK_fashexpansion_finalize_industrial_policy_desc:0 "The industrial base of Russia has developed since the West Russian War, despite Bukharin's disastrous policies. However, it has not developed in a sane or consistent manner. Various warlord states' grandiose industrial visions have been carried out in clashing, contradictory ways, with redundant supply chains and technologies intended to make use of domestic resources. One of the most critical economic issues we face is binding all of our regional economies together, making use of the enhanced economics of scale, and working to ensure that functional and efficient logistics networks are operational."
 NIK_fashexpansion_roads_that_bind_us_desc:0 "Expanding on our logistical ambitions, another issue that we must face is our lack of coherent centralized rail or road systems. While warlord states did indeed build roads, they were often insular and limited, not connected to roads in other fiefdoms. An understandable priority, but one that we most rectify. New bridges must be build over rivers that once formed borders between warring states, collapsed tunnels must be re-excavated, and miles upon miles of road and rail must be laid, to build the new ties that bind us together as a true nation, rather than a mere collection of smaller states."
 NIK_fashexpansion_revitalized_russian_people_desc:0 "Most importantly of all of our reforms to the new Russian state, the people's morale and political will must be revived. For too long, warlord conflict, bombings, and stavation has eroded the shared identity of the Russian people, and eaten at the Russian patriotism within the hearts of the populace.\n\nA patriotic curriculum in schools must be established, focusing on our shared Russian identity. At long last, our people shall once more be revitalized, and their hearts shall beat with pride for our new state."
 NIK_fashexpansion_one_last_chance_desc:0 "Only one more task remains to ensure our complete control over West Russia, and our mandate to unite the rest of Eurasia. The reclamation of the territory of Onega, and a victory over the state of Finland on the field of battle. Finland presents a unique opportunity, as our gateway to Europe - securing a favorable peace deal with the Finnish state will both allow for possible territorial reclamation, but also serves as a show of strength to Germany and all other Pakt-aligned nations. By defeating Finland, we can secure honor and recognition in the eyes of the international community, and be respected for our triumphant martial prowess."

 NIK_fashexpansion_the_internal_conflict_desc:0 "When a united right wing coalition was announced, few could believe an alliance of different parties was possible; even fewer believed this coalition could get into power. However, those skeptics are now proving themselves right as the faction leaders feud and bicker amongst themselves. The question of when it will collapse is not a matter of if, but when. The civil servants who run the country must prepare for the coalition's dissolution and a return to factionalism and infighting, ensuring that the new power struggle will not be as destructive as the old."
 NIK_fashexpansion_crack_the_coalition_desc:0 "The Coalition as it stands is a complete farce. Every day, its representatives in the National Assembly fight each other with words and with fists over the most trivial matters of policy. Notifications to the leaders of rival parties and issuing declarations of revoking our participation in the Coalition will be easy to send, and the likelihood of other parties accepting is very high. The official dissolution of the Coalition may mean a return to the days of constant deadlock, political infighting and inter-party street battles, but at the very least it will reflect the current reality on the assembly floor."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_new_oaths_desc:0 "The Coalition lies in shambles, its members are feuding with each other both in the debating hall and the street, and the National Assembly is aimless in its direction. If its representatives were to swear allegiance to one party, it would do much to restore public faith in the government, particularly as few citizens believe they have loyalty to anyone other than themselves. However, the question of who to swear loyalty to remains. It is still divided among party lines, and pledging allegiance to one would only unite the Assembly against them. Many deals and compromises will have to be made between leadership and representatives, but a united Assembly may just be possible."
 NIK_fashexpansion_make_a_break_for_it_desc:0 "The men who were once the torchbearers for a new vision of Russia have devolved into bickerers and factionists. The old guard of the Passionariyy can no longer be trusted to rebuild the Motherland - however, that does not mean Russia does not have a future any more. Taboritsky, Serov, and others did not join the Passionariyy out of idealism, but of convenience, but they are the ones who the torch shall be passed onto, who shall return Russia to glory. Perhaps a proposal to cut them a deal to increase their power in Komi is in the works."
 NIK_fashexpansion_forward_to_the_future_desc:0 "Serov is an outlier, a self-proclaimed socialist who believes that the Russian worker should be the centre of the new Russian order the Passionariyy seek to create. Thus far, he has been almost completely rejected by more orthodox Passionariyy members, which makes his vision so invigorating. By agitating the common people and showing them how the rise of Russia is in the best of interests for workers across the nation, he may be the one who can reinvigorate Russia with their strength and lead her back to glory."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_red_brown_alliance_desc:0 "Communism and its platitudes of equality for all people has been properly consigned into the pages of history; however, a sizable contingent of people refuse to acknowledge this. However, rather than showing them how obsolete their beliefs are in person, with the rise of Serov, it may be more useful to find them places in the Passionariyy order. Certainly not all men are created equal, but all Russian workers are, and by convincing them to abandon their delusional belief that foreigners should be treated the same as Russians, we will be rewarded with a large base of experienced politicians in our quest to rebuild Russia."

The Motherland is bitterly divided, and her people are fearful and in want, easy prey to the traitors and parasites that feast upon her sickened body. Taboritsky tells us it wasn't always like this. Under the Holy Tsar, he says, the Russians walked the path of righteousness. Everyone knew their place in the world and did their duty to the Motherland and for that, she wielded immense wealth and power. Taboritsky wants us to improve our wretched condition, return to the natural order and step back on the path of righteousness. Once we return to the traditional way of things, he promises, the glories of the past will return to us.\n\nDoes the future of Russia lie in the past?"

Now that we have taken power, the cause of Monarchism is inescapably tied to us - if we should fail, it will fail along with us.

It was said at the time that his only son and heir, Tsarevich Alexei, was murdered as well. That was a lie. The righteous Tsar lives! Whisked away before the traitors could kill him, and in hiding for almost fifty years now, he awaits the time when Russia has returned to the path of righteousness. Only then he will return and restore the greatness we all knew in the past.

If Gumilyov's faction carries the day, they will seek to consolidate the Passionaryy, then lead us to a future where we can rise above petty concerns and regionalisms to pursue their grand vision of United Eurasia.

We will be pragmatic in how we rule the republic, we will be practical in our day-to-day rule and we will apply the lessons learnt from past failures - both our own and those of others. As long as we remain true to our ethos of compassionate conservatism and informed by the ancient traditions of our nation, we can afford to experiment with policy."
 NIK_fashexpansion_unite_the_party_desc:0 "Our movement is home to a great variety of political groupings, united only by their common rejection of both communism and the status quo in the republic. This breadth has served us well in getting this far, but the cracks between groupings are showing more clearly by the day, and our cohesion suffers as a result. It is time to sharpen our focus. We will reunite the Organization around the alliance at the core of the Passionaryy, the partnership between Igor Shafarevich and Lev Gumilyov. While they disagree on some points, both are used to working with the other, and the two of them together will command a stronger, more focused Passionaryy."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_anti_establishment_alliance_desc:0 "The places of Sergey Taboritsky and Ivan Serov have always been at the fringes of our movement, and with the upcoming convention they are at risk of being sidelined by their more established rivals. Together, they might be able to accomplish what neither can do on their own - scrape together enough support to alter the course of the movement, and take control of the Organization. Surely the most temporary of alliances, as the two men disagree on almost everything except their desire for a substantial change in direction and leadership, the pact needs to hold together long enough to defeat their chief rivals and reduce the running to a two-horse race."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_convention_desc:0 "To an outside observer, the Great Convention of the Passionaryy Organization must be a decidedly odd spectacle. The effort to get a big tent party comprising social conservatives, radical eurasianists, traditional monarchists and everything in between to agree on a shared doctrine is proving to be a challenge. So challenging, in fact, that an alternative proposal for uniting the party is quickly becoming the preferred option. Called the "Convergence", it consists of a vote, to be held at the end of the assembly, to determine the leader of the Organization and the new Head of State."
 NIK_fashexpansion_the_final_words_desc:0 "The Convergence looms. Lines are being drawn ever more firmly as the primary leadership candidates make their last appeals to the voting membership. There are no more debates to be had, no more backroom deals to be made. The four men will each make a final speech and then - the decision. The only other question to be decided is who will be the one to speak last. It's the most desired position in the order of speeches by all four candidates, and whoever secures it will have gained both the prestige of a small victory and the perceived benefit of having the last word before the vote. Who will it be?"
 NIK_fashexpansion_convergence_desc:0 "The final speeches have been held, and it is time for the Convergence to take place. Four men will enter the National Assembly as candidates, each hoping to emerge from the vote as president, ready to guide the Passionaryy to achieve their vision. Only one will succeed. With everything now at stake, tensions are running high. The candidates have all committed to respect the assembly, but it's anyone's guess how long that respect goes should the tide turn against them."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_focus_on_methods_desc:0 "The breadth of thought in our movement extends to political strategy. While there is a general agreement we need to be diligent in managing public support and opposition, what measures we should use and where our focus should be is proving a difficult discussion. Some believe that information campaigns about our great work should be enough to keep the public on our side. Others propose we tie ourselves much more strongly to the Orthodox Church. There is also support for campaigns to suppress dissent and opposition more forcefully, with disagreement centering more on the proposed extent and violence of them. It is time to make a decision."
 NIK_fashexpansion_draft_a_constitution_desc:0 "In order to strengthen our hold on the republic and guide it to a better future, we should draft a new constitution. This will mark a break with the corrupt old order and let us show the republic our good intentions. That the drafting process will show us where the prominent voices in our organization land on key issues, and who in our organization commands the influence to push their favorite clauses through is just an added benefit, of course."
 NIK_fashexpansion_a_united_left_desc:0 "There's little love lost between Ivan Serov and Igor Shafarevich. If there ever was a time for the two men to bury the hatchet, however, it is now. Every day, the cracks in our movement are becoming more apparent, and the looming reckoning more clear. If the prospect of losing a power struggle was not enough to make bedfellows of the two, the men they would be losing to will be. Lev Gumilyov and Sergey Taboritsky have enough grandiose delusions between them to equip a ward full of mental patients. Combined with influence, power and a lack of scruples, either could do great damage to the republic."

 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_people_desc:0 "Zhdanov has a vision, one that encompasses the entirety of Russia. He believes in a strong, democratic state where the people are both free and at the same time capable of rallying to a strong leader in times of need.\n\nWith our hold over the state secured, we can start working on our long-term projects for Komi, and slowly prepare our nation and our people for the greatest struggle of our time, the reclamation of the Soviet Union!"
 NIK_zhdanov_enough_of_this_nonsense_desc:0 "Libertarianism has proved ineffectual in tackling the many problems that plague not only komi, but the entirety of Russia. Freedom does not mean anarchy, and the party has unanimously decided that the time has come for a shift in focus: of course, with "shift in focus" we mean "shift in government"\n\nThrough the use of "Revolutionary Decrees" we shall transform Komi into a nation that has the wellbeing of the nation - and not of the politicians - as its foremost priority. Long live Russia! Long live the Soviet Union! Long live Ultravisionary Socialism! Long live Comrade Zhdanov!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_social_sphere_desc:0 "If we are to maintain ourselves into power, we need to bring the people to our side. Through the Revolutionary Decrees, we seized power from the corrupt politicians, but we also made many promises to the people in order to make them drink from the bitter cup: now we need to decide whether to actually keep our word.\n\nOn one hand, we have no such obligation. We are in power, and we can freely decide what's best for the people of Komi without accounting to anyone. On the other, we know what the consequences of such a choice will be, so we'd better reflect upon the matter carefully..."
 NIK_zhdanov_repeal_the_revolutionary_decrees_desc:0 "The Revolutionary Decrees were nothing but a mean to an end. The end was keeping the people calm while we consolidated our power in the government, and now that our objective has been achieved, we can safely repeal them: the government has the right to break its promises for the good of the nation!\n\nThere will surely be protests, big protests. Still, Zhdanov believes they will fade in the end, because socialism may be a great and beautiful utopia, but in order to make it become reality we need to make sacrifices: the sooner the populace learns this simple concept, the better."
 NIK_zhdanov_a_diversion_for_the_people_desc:0 "Our citizens will surely protest a lot if we don't keep our word. In difficult times such as these, it takes little to spark a civil war, and Zhdanov isn't confident he has the power to quench dissent: for this reason, he has given his assent to the approval of a new welfare system that will bring prosperity to the people.\n\nOf course, this is nothing but a diversion. Well-fed, happy people don't protest when their freedom is taken away, and we have all intention of exploiting such a simple yet important truth: is we need to pay some money to ensure the greatness of the Soviet Union, then so be it!"
 NIK_zhdanov_renewed_soviet_patriotism_desc:0 "Patriotism keeps nations together, but we are a different kind of nation. The Soviet Union will, one day for sure, encompass the entire world in a blessed socialist utopia, which means that fostering "normal" patriotism won't do.\n\nIn order to ensure our new nation stands the test of time, we shall create a new Soviet identity, and convince the people to believe in it. The Soviet Union was once the greatest nation in the world, and it will return to its rightful place!"
 NIK_zhdanov_political_reliability_desc:0 "Unlike libertarian socialists, we know that each and every person has a value. Nameless assemblies will soon fester with corruption and infighting, but we know better: in order to ensure stability, we need to rely on people of outstanding competence and loyalty to the socialist ideals.\n\nBy looking for such people inside the party bureaucracy, and trusting them with positions of power, we'll surely improve both efficiency and reliability of the administration. This is the true Soviet way!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_state_sphere_desc:0 "There are many political parties within Komi, and not all of them approve of our most recent developments. In order to strengthen our rule upon the country, we'll need to deal with them: some can be appeased, or even convinced to join us, while others... well it won't be so pretty.\n\nFor the good of the Soviet Union, we need to deal with this matter immediately, or risk serious civil strife when we can't afford it. We should immediately begin talks with the other political actors, and see whether they wish to be on the "friends of socialism" list, or in the "political persecution" one..."
 NIK_zhdanov_a_paramount_leader_desc:0 "In this new Soviet Union, we don't need the illusion of separation between party and government. Socialism demands truth, and we'll devote all our energies towards turning it into reality: to this end, we shall overhaul the obsolete institutions of Komi to better represent this new state of affairs.\n\nThe offices of Premier and General Secretary will be merged into a single one, creating a truly and completely socialist government. Long live the Paramount Leader of the Soviet Union, comrade Zhdanov!"
 NIK_zhdanov_absorb_the_suslovites_desc:0 "Even though Suslov is gone for good, his followers still infest the party. Their silly talks about "orthodoxy" and "socialist democracy" are commencing to tire Paramount Leader Zhdanov: we can't tolerate divisions within the party, and we'll need to deal with them soon.\n\nThose who are reasonable enough will be allowed to remain - and perhaps given "economic incentivization" to keep them loyal - while the others will be expelled from the party. And we all know that being expelled from the party means the end of one's political life..."
 NIK_zhdanov_silence_the_bukharinites_desc:0 "At the beginning, we formed a pact of mutual assistance with Bukharina in order to solidify our power. Now, however, they are beginning to protest for the fact that we are slowly but steadily side-lining them: a pity, because now that they have discovered it, we'll be forced to simply remove them from any office within the party and the government.\n\nThere is no place for division or disloyalty in the Soviet Union we are going to build, and all those who resist the plans our Paramount Leader is drawing for the nation do not deserve to partake of his power. Out with the traitors!"
 NIK_zhdanov_assemble_the_technocrats_desc:0 "The people can't decide for themselves, they will only fall prey of demagogues and bourgeois who will exploit them for their own selfish goals. What the people need is a competent government, made of experts who know what the nation needs to grow and be prosperous, and know how to achieve the goal.\n\nParamount Leader Zhdanov has formed a new government, one where scientists, economists, engineers and medics will be allowed to run their own ministries. Such a change in pace will surely help us recover from the German bombings and the damages wrought to Russia by the civil strife: with the certainty of knowledge, we march towards the future!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_scientific_system_desc:0 "Ultravisionary Socialism isn't like the other thousands of deviations from Lenin's' Socialism. It is an entirely new ideology, an evolution, just like humanity is bound to evolve and forever improve. Ultravisionary Socialism is the first form of Scientific Socialism, one where politics and science are fused in order to improve the lives of the Soviet citizens.\n\nGuided by the benevolent and knowing hand of our Paramount Leader and his loyal experts, the future of the Soviet Union looks bright. With a strong state, a patriotic citizenry and a technocratic government, no one will be able to oppose us!"
 
 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_economy_desc:0 "We all know the pitiful state our economy is in. Twenty years of civil strife and Luftwaffe bombings have left our nation in tatters, and our economic system with it: infrastructures lay brokena, industries have reverted into small workshops due to the fear of being targeted by the bombs, and our agricultural sector seems ripped from a book about the middle age, with the constant risk of famine.\n\nOur leader knows all this, but unlike all others, he knows how to address it. In his vision are all the needed steps to take to restore Komi to its former glory, and from such a base reclaim the entirety of the Soviet Union: he leads us, we only need to follow!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_revolutionary_course_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union lost the war due to its inefficient economy. Bukharin insisted on small industry when what he needed was a strong, centrally-planned economy centered around heavy industry and mass-mechanization: now it falls upon us to mend his mistakes.\n\nBy assessing our resources and forming the needed legal framework, we'll lay the groundwork for our new economy, one where the state leads with a strong and knowing hand amidst the difficult currents of the world!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_new_five_year_plan_desc:0 "As the first step of our new economic policy, we need to decide where to focus our attention. Over the course of the next five years, we will address several key problems of our state, and drastically improve the condition of our economy. However, due to our scarce initial resources, we'll need to choose where to invest the heaviest part of the funds: the other issues will be tackled after the primary focus has been achieved.\n\nOn one hand, we can devote ourselves to rebuilding our infrastructure network, as without roads and railroads we can't send resources to our industrial hubs. On the other, we could kickstart our industrial sector by building several new heavy industries: from there will come the materials to repair the infrastructure."
 NIK_zhdanov_universal_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "Infrastructure has been heavily damaged and disrupted by German bombs and local bandits. In order to bring a modicum of normality in the everyday life, and ensure a constant stream of supplies to our industries, we need to both repair what's broken and replace what's obsolete.\n\nBy creating a dedicated commission tasked with overseeing the state of our infrastructure, we can slowly but steadily improve our situation. From there, everything will improve if given enough time and effort."
 NIK_zhdanov_industrial_lynchpins_desc:0 "Some of our cities, such as Gorky, have great economic value as they are home to well-developed and mostly-intact industrial plants. By making these cities the lynchpin of our production sector, we'll have them produce what the rest of the nation needs to rebuild and improve.\n\nFrom there, just as a heart brings lifeblood to the rest of the body, so will the Soviet Union receive new energy to restore us to our rightful place as one of the greatest industrial powers of Earth!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc:0 "Russia is rich with resources, but most of them are still untapped. To make things worse, the war and the Luftwaffe bombings have either destroyed or isolated several important extraction plants: this is putting a strain on our industrias development programs.\n\nIn order to improve our economy, we need to both rebuild and improve our existing facilities, and establish new production plants wherever we can find new ore veins or other important natural resources."
 NIK_zhdanov_urban_resettlement_programs_desc:0 "During the course of the last twenty years, millions of people all across the Soviet Union fled from the cities to avoid bombings, poverty and famine. While the countryside fared no better than the urban areas, at least there was food: now that the emergency is over, we find ourselves with empty factories in the cities and thousands of unemployed in the more rural regions of the country.\n\nIn order to both reduce unemployment in the countryside, and supply our industrial sector with all the workers it needs in preparation for its future expansion, we'll begin a plan of urban resettlement. Young, unemployed men and women in our rural regions will be incentivized - or forced if they refuse - to transfer to the nearest cities, where we'll build new houses for everyone, thus also kickstarting the construction industry."
 NIK_zhdanov_building_the_future_desc:0 "When our leader said he had a vision, he didn't lie. Through his cunning plans and great foresight, we have drastically improved both the economy of the Soviet Union and the lives of the people: production keeps increasing, and now we have functioning infrastructure and well-managed cities filled with industrious citizens.\n\nThere's still much to do before we can truly restore the Soviet Union, but this is a step in the right direction. We are no longer plagued by our past and our mistakes: instead, we are building a tall bridge towards our future! Forward, comrades!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_peoples_commissariat_of_science_desc:0 "Ultravisionary Socialism is not just a catchy name. We who believe in Ultravisionarism believe first and foremost in the freeing power of science: scientific progress is key to the evolution of mankind, and just as socialism it frees the masses from prejudice and superstition.\n\nIt is only natural that a socialist government is devoted, among many other things, to the pursuit of technological advancement, for the betterment of both the state and its citizens.\n\nTo this end, we shall establish a new People's Commissariat, one where science is not humbled and forced to bend to ideology, but where we, who do not know, bow in front of those who know, or who will find a way for everyone to know."
 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_future_desc:0 "If we want to truly claim that we pursue the advancement of science and society, we need to prove it with facts. Our education system is obsolete and underfunded, and most schools desperately need refurbishment, or complete reconstruction.\n\nBy granting more funds to schools and universities, and establishing new, advanced study courses for our superior learning institutes, we will not only pursue our vision of the future: we shall turn it into a reality!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_psychological_revolution_desc:0 "Psychology has always been overlooked by the capitalist nations. It brings no profit into the pockets of the bourgeoisie and it does not serve to keep the lower classes enslaved, therefore it is useless. We, on the other hand, realize its great potential for the betterment of the people.\n\nBy studying the human mind and its inner workings, we can create a society where the needs of the soul are as satisfied as the needs of the body: by granting true happiness to our citizens, we shall prove the superiority of both Socialist ideology and Socialist science!"
 NIK_zhdanov_experimental_armaments_desc:0 "We may have great plans for the Soviet Union, but our army struggles to match the dimensions of our dreams. With a small manpower pool, and an even smaller industrial base, we can't hope to overwhelm our enemies with sheer numbers. Instead of wasting time in something we can never achieve, we need to focus on the greatest weapon at our disposal: science.\n\nWith our renewed focus on technological advancement, we can create a dedicated research team whose sole focus shall be the development of new weapons. By meeting our enemy on the battlefield armed with overwhelmingly superior equipment, their numbers will melt like snow in summer: socialist science shall pave the way to supremacy!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_socialist_society_desc:0 "Some might say that we have achieved our dream, that with the reforms we have implemented we have created a society whose greatest aspiration is the pursuit of knowledge. Some misguided fools may even claim that we have created an advanced socialist society.\n\nThey are sorely wrong.\n\nThis is nothing but the start. All that we have done until now is nothing but laying the groundwork for the true scientific revolution. It will be in the next years that we make our dream come true: a socialist future, a truly socialist society... a truly socialist world. Forward!"
 NIK_zhdanov_tractors_for_the_peasants_desc:0 "Our agricultural sector has mostly returned to the Middle Age. Farmers try to get by with what little they can grow in their mismanaged farms, using the tools that their grandfathers used, and the fathers of their grandfathers before them. This is unacceptable: if we truly want to rebuild the Soviet Union to what it was before, we'll need to have a healthy surplus of food for our growing cities.\n\nTo this end, we shall destine funds to acquire modern tractors and industrial farming tools for the farmers. The progressive mechanization of agriculture will not only improve the gross output of our farmland, but also free up more potential workforce for the factories: this way, our society will slowly shift towards socialism by itself!"
 NIK_zhdanov_industrial_farming_operations_desc:0 "Industrial farming isn't just about having tractors and threshing machines. It is about training farmers in the use of modern farming methods, developing more efficient supply routes, building aqueducts to improve field output, selecting more resistant crops and much, much more.\n\nFor millennia, agriculture has been about tradition and chance. In this new age of socialism, we tolerate neither: with new technologies and competent planning, we'll turn our countryside into a productive part of our country, for the betterment of the people, and for the sake of socialism."

 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago." 
 NIK_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_west_russian_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery."
 NIK_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_world_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_zhdanov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_zhdanov_an_army_for_the_motherland_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_next_generation_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 NIK_zhdanov_doctrinal_refinement_desc:0 "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_unions_finest_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_zhdanov_a_cutting_edge_rifle_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We shall begin trials with a variety of new and revolutionary designs, submitted by our finest visionaries and weapons designers. The key to defeating Germany may very well be a cutting-edge rifle!"
 NIK_zhdanov_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force.The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_zhdanov_revive_the_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

 NIK_zhdanov_a_vision_for_the_world_desc:0 "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that Socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 NIK_zhdanov_restore_international_trade_desc:0 "While one of the many nations of the world may seek to buid a series of embassies to represent the "governments" of foreign nation, our Federation is not a mere nation amongst equals. Our Federation is in its own league - the seed of a socialist superculture that shall one day grow to encompass most of the world. Thusly, rather than the standard diplomatic practices of most nations, the Paramount Leader has ordered the Foreign Ministry to construct a grand edifice in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] - the Embassy of the Global Proletariat.\n\nThis edifice shall contain representatives of the working class across the world, with delegates that embody the spirit of the working class of each and every nation. While our relations may be limited now, there is no reason to limit ourselves - nations that refuse to send delegates shall be properly represented as well, by Soviet citizens that best exemplify the socialization of the working class within their host nation's civilization. Regardless of their willingness to adhere to our policies, the world shall be represented, in the true spirit of socialist internationalism!"
 NIK_zhdanov_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc:0 "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 NIK_zhdanov_mission_to_nuuk_desc:0 "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the Socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_scandanavian_mission_desc:0 "Europe lies under a steel wall of Fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 NIK_zhdanov_request_swedish_reconciliation_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_zhdanov_congratulate_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 NIK_zhdanov_an_english_embassy_desc:0 "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the Fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 NIK_zhdanov_international_socialist_solidarity_desc:0 "With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Socialist International has been proposed. Like the ComIntern that came before it, the SocIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the SocIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"
 NIK_zhdanov_condemn_reactionary_imperialism_desc:0 "The imperialism of the capitalist and fascist powers of the world truly knows no bounds. Greatest of all among the imperial powers of the world is the German Reich, whose conquests have spanned from Africa, to Moscow, to the formerly spotless seas of Luna. Their reckless, genocidal madness has enroached to the territories of the USSR, and imposed brutal, regressive tyranny upon a formerly liberated society. This shall not stand. We shall compose a message directly to Germany, condemning their regressive nature and their horrific imperialism. While we do not expect a reply, to inform them of their inevitable fate is the greatest mercy that we are willing to afford the reactionary invader."

 NIK_suslov_refound_the_party_desc:0 "It's clear that our task is to rebuild the Soviet Union in a more perfect form. In order to reflect our renewed purpose, we shall disband the Communist Party of Komi and rebuild the Bolshevik All-Union communist Party!\n\nThe VKP(b) will return to the forefront of our politics as we prepare to expand, and it will be the political vanguard of our desire to reunite Russia under the flag of Lenin!"
 NIK_suslov_the_first_reformed_congress_of_the_cpsu_desc:0 "The first congress of the reformed VKP(b) will be the place where we decide the political direction that we'll take in the reconstruction of the Soviet Union. All most prominent members - and of course our leader - will take turns in exlaining their beliefs, and try to convince the assembly to adopt their proposed resolution.\n\nThis is a great opportunity to set our doctrine in stone, and what we decide today will echo in the halls of Moscow when we return there in triumph! Long live the Soviet Union! Long live communism! Long live Lenin!"
 NIK_suslov_ensure_collective_rule_desc:0 "Many misinformed people consider the Soviet Union - and Communism as a whole - as a dictatorial government akin to National Socialism. This is nothing but a lie: in its true form, Communism is collective rule, made by the people and for the people. We have nothing in common with tyrants, be they monarchs or dictators!\n\nIn order to reassure all, both inside and outside Komi, that what we support is not dictatorial rule, but democracy in its truest form, we shall set in stone that our ultimate goal is to create a government where everyone has a say. Whenever a decision needs to be taken, the people and its elected institutions shall vote, and the majority opinion will be followed by all: such is democratic centralism, the true way to social justice!"
 NIK_suslov_the_precedent_of_consensus_desc:0 "While democratic centralism at its core means that the majority rules, this principle must be tempered in the doctrine of Bolshevism, which teaches us that the people must always have their say. We can't claim to be true pursuers of justice if we show disdain for the opinion of the people and its democratically chosen institutions.\n\nTo this end, all decisions taken by the government will be strengthened by a qualified majority of the elective body. It might make our path a bit longer, our pace a bit slower, but we are carrying the freedom of the Soviet people: such a beautiful and fragile thing must be held with all due care, lest it breaks forever..."
 NIK_suslov_the_need_for_decisiveness_desc:0 "The people must always have their say in matters of government, however there are situations in which an expert government sees farther than those it represents. Even good-willed people may act rashly or with poor foresight: in order to put a remedy to such mistakes - even if made in good faith - the government must be able to overrule the elected body.\n\nTo this end, the General Secretary will have the power to veto any decision taken by the Presidium. In order to show our commitment to democracy, the Presidium will be able to overrule the Secretary's veto with a qualified majority of two thirds of its votes. We march to glory, for the Soviet Union!"
 NIK_suslov_audit_regional_parties_desc:0 "In the old times, ethnic minorities within the Soviet Union were organized into Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics. There, they could contribute in their unique way to the advancement of the Socialist cause, safe in the knowledge that their tongue, their traditions and their way of life would not be threatened to be swallowed by the Russian majority.\n\nWith the collapse of the Union, of course the ASSRs were abolished, but this doesn't prevent us from re-establishing them, at least on theoretical ground. Should we ever be able to incorporate lands held by the old minorities in our bid to reclaim Russia, they will return to the old system, granting stability and legitimacy to our rule."
 NIK_suslov_unity_in_ideology_desc:0 "In the old times, people were kept together by obedience to a crown or by brute force. In our enlightened nation, instead, people willingly band together by sharing the same ideology. No nation can stand the test of time if its citizens quarrel on all matters of government: in division lie the seeds of autocracy.\n\nIn order to enact democratic centralism with full efficiency, we shall adapt our ideology to the modern times, removing all obsolete or controversial ideas, and purifying it with our own zeal. The result will become our party line, that we shall carry all the way to Moscow!"
 NIK_suslov_address_offical_standards_desc:0 "Competence is a rare quality in these troubled times. All around us, and sometimes even among us, lurk corrupt, inefficient, disloyal officers, who pursue their own goal above the nation, or are simply too stubborn or proud to admit that they are utterly unable to serve the nation as it deserves to be.\n\nIf we are to be a beacon for the beleaguered peoples of Russia, then we need to excel in all things, including the difficult art of administration. We must choose the best for the bureaucracy, and institute laws and organs that will punish the corrupt and the incompetent as harshly as it is needed, for the good of all..."
 NIK_suslov_a_competent_bureaucracy_desc:0 "It appears that the Soviets, the basic economic unit - and the very namesake - of the Soviet Union, have been getting ahead of themselves as of late. They already elect the Supreme Soviet and the Presidium, and have other duties assigned to them by the law, but they still want more influence over government affairs.\n\nThis is where it ends. Adherence to the law is what defines the Soviet man, not thirst for power. We shall make it clear that the Soviets already have their powers and duties, and that exceeding the mandate of the law is a crime. A very serious crime."
 NIK_suslov_a_commitment_to_socialism_desc:0 "Socialism is the future of mankind. Freed by the shackles of the bourgeoisie, the workers of all the world can - and will - unite, and build a new, perfect world. This is the key tenet of the socialist doctrine, OUR doctrine, and we'll make sure all know it!\n\nRadios, newspapers, every cog in our propaganda machine will be geared towards praising the gospel of socialism, and our commitment to its tenets. By adhering to the socialist doctrine, and slowly perfecting it towards communism, we shall pave the way for the nations of the world to follow!"
 NIK_suslov_a_commitment_to_the_party_desc:0 "As the vanguard of socialism and communism into the world, the Party is the very embodiment of socialist doctrine and purpose. Our government was elected thanks to the efforts of the Party, and from it come our most important and competent advisors and ministers. Denying such a simple truth is akin to madness!\n\nIn order to show our gratitude to the party, the government will make sure to consult it often, and party officials and bureaucrats will receive several additional duties within the government, so that they may integrate even more perfectly our state with our party doctrine."
 NIK_suslov_uplift_progressive_values_desc:0 "Socialism is so much more than merely a political ideology. It is a culture, a set of values to use every day: we can even say that socialism is a way of life, the most perfect in the world! In socialism, the workers work as much as the nation demands, and they receive everything they need to make their lives meaningful and worth living.\n\nWith our renewed emphasis on our socialist roots, we should make sure that everyone understands that socialism is something that permeates their entire lives, not just the electoral urn. To this end, we'll enact a propaganda campaign aimed at exalting socialist values and their contribution to society."
 NIK_suslov_the_new_soviet_woman_desc:0 "For centuries, capitalists and religious leaders have forced the woman to bend to their will, binding their free will and intellect with moral chains and derogative concepts such as "queen of the house" and "naturally destined to motherhood"\n\nIn our free socialist Russia, women are equal to men under all aspects! We shall demand that they do as men, and we shall grant them the same rights and choices any man gets. Farmer, teacher, mother, soldier, secretary general: if they show the attitude, they'll find a way to it!"
 NIK_suslov_proclaim_social_equality_desc:0 "Like hammer and sickle, man and woman are fundamental to socialism, each with their own role. We proclaim the freedom of all workers from the shackles imposed by capitalism and moralism, and the role of the woman will no longer be that of a glorified cook and babymaker!\n\nAt the same, we understand that man and woman have each their own peculiarities. Equality must be tempered by the laws of nature, and while a woman will never be forced to assume a role she doesn't want, we should still incentivize all to follow the path evolution has set."
 NIK_suslov_encourage_the_people_desc:0 "Unlike the autocracies or the false democracies, the Soviet Union is made firstly by its workers and citizens! We are the only ones who truly let the common man and woman participate to the government, and it is extremely important for the health of our political system that as many as possible take interest in politics.\n\nThe socialist revolution and the class struggle are permanent features of our life as long as a single nation on Earth is still ruled by the bourgeois, and all loyal Soviet citizens should fulfill their duty to the cause of Lenin, be it in the factory, on the field of battle or in the hall of the Presidium!"
 NIK_suslov_unity_in_purpose_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union was plagued by infighting. Political deviance was regarded as religious heresy, and many were burned at the stake - some even literally - for a slight deviation from party doctrine. If we want our new Union to stand the test of time, we need to unite rather than divide, and convince rather than force: we won't make the same mistakes as our predecessors, we can't afford it right now!\n\nTo this end, we'll accept all those who truly believe in the socialist cause, no matter their shade of red. In difficult times, we need all the friends we need.\n\nSo long as they learn the true way of Marxist orthodoxy in time."
 NIK_suslov_the_revolution_renewed_desc:0 "After a long struggle, a truly socialist government has been restored, and we have begun marching once again towards the rising sun! Despite our difficult times, we have restored the people's faith in Lening's heirs, and our party stands united by the secretary general's side.\n\nLenin set something beautiful in motion, more than fifty years ago. Now, it falls upon us to continue his legacy: the revolutionary spirit hasn't been crushed by the German panzers, and neither has it been blown apart by the Luftwaffe. Now, we renew our vows to the permanent revolution, to see its flame burn bright: workers of the world, forward!"

 NIK_suslov_revive_the_economy_desc:0 "After twenty years of civil strife and German bombings, the once powerful Soviet industrial machine has long since been relieved of its mortal worries. Abandoned factories litter what few cities can still pride themselves of such a name, their roofs collapsed under the bomb or due to neglect, their machineries broken beyond repairs.\n\nOur infrastructure too has been reduced to ashes, with roads, bridges and railroads interrupted by craters or floods, and our agricultural sector barely manages to feed our populace. Famine is a common issue for our beleaguered nation, and nothing will change if we can't at least keep our men and women from starving to death.\n\nStill, from difficulties come opportunities. With the German bombings gone, we have the chance, for the first time since the beginning of this nightmare, to better our condition: plans will be drafter, resources will be stored, and a new age of socialist industrialization will begin for the new Soviet Union! By the hammer and the sickle!"
 NIK_suslov_empower_the_gosplan_desc:0 "The Gosplan was founded by Bukharin as the economic planning board of the old Soviet Union. In the end, it wasn't used much due to his preference for light industry, and the results became evident during the war. While the agency has way less resources than our Motherland at the height of her power, we'll use our resources in a much more considerate manner.\n\nWe'll immediately assign enough personnel and funds to the agency so that it may begin drafting long-period plans for our economy, and devise short-term solutions for the issues currently plaguing our country. Our plans will reach much further than what we can achieve now, and we'll be prepared for anything that may come at us!"
 NIK_suslov_towards_the_next_phase_desc:0 "With our final goal being the establishment of a true communist regime, we need to set the first stones in our economy just as we are doing in politics. The state must oversee the entire economy, planning with precision and care the future needs of the country and the people, and ensure that production never exceeds demand, or vice versa.\n\nBy carefully balancing our resources for maximum industrial growth, and planning for the long term in case anything happens, we'll kick start both our economy and our advance towards true communism! The Soviet Union advances!"
 NIK_suslov_oversee_the_planning_desc:0 "The Gosplan has started working, and the resulting plans are satisfying to say the least. By further increasing their funds and personnel, we'll have both a tighter control over the economy, and more experts dedicated to the betterment of the Soviet people.\n\nAs our economy starts recovering, it is fundamental that we remain steady and do not fall prey to excesses. Even growing too much can be detrimental in the long run, and we must make sure that we do everything flawlessly."
 NIK_suslov_expand_central_production_nodes_desc:0 "Right now, our industries are located primarily around our few cities, with the capital being the most prominent. However, we'll need much more if we are to see our plans turned into reality: Gorky and the other industrial nodes must first be brought back into functioning order by repairing damaged or obsolete infrastructure, and bringing in modern machinery from wherever we can fetch it.\n\nOnce the preliminary work is done, we can start expanding them, interconnecting the region with modern railroads and building more industries, that will in turn give work to the masses of impoverished farmers coming from the countryside. Slowly but steadily, we'll increase our production capabilities, until we are poised to begin with the real economic struggle!"
 NIK_suslov_honor_the_peasants_desc:0 "One of the greatest mistakes of the Soviet Union was its excessive reliance on industrial cities. The people need to eat as much as they need in order to be both healthy and loyal, and in the larger scheme of things, a famine can be as much as a catastrophe as any military defeat.\n\nThe farmers are a fundamental part of any country, and especially a socialist one. No one will ever be allowed to think them "inferior" to industrial workers or to the bourgeois, and anyone daring to take their contribution for granted will be punished: an army marches on its stomach, and this is valid for countries too!"
 NIK_suslov_mechanize_the_kolkhozes_desc:0 "The Kolkhozes are collective farms organized by the state so that they can achieve maximum production efficiency. Until now, with our limited means this mainly meant that agricultural tools such as plows and scytes were shared between the farmers and that the workforce was assembled following centralized plans.\n\nWith our renewed focus on industrialization and economic growth, we shall finance a large agricultural mechanization plan for the Kolkhozes. Buying large stocks of farming machines such as tractors or threshing machines, we'll bring our agricultural sector out of the age of the tzars and into the modern age of socialism! Production will increase tenfolds, and farmers will be much happier as they no longer have to break their backs on the fields!"
 NIK_suslov_develop_refining_infrastructure_desc:0 "Oil refining is a complicated process that requires large investments. In the days of the old Soviet Union, the oil fields in the Caucasus covered our domestic needs, but we no longer have such a luxury: fuel is a rare and precious resource to obtain, and often the only way to get some is to pay black market dealers or rely on fickle peace treaties between several warlords.\n\nA modern industrial society can't survive without such a fundamental resource, and as such it is our duty to secure a stable and reliable source of the liquid gold. By funding the construction of refineries across our nation we'll make sure that our industries and mines have at least their basic needs satisfied until we can find some real oil."
 NIK_suslov_increase_resource_production_quotas_desc:0 "Our industrial sector is growing, which means our need for raw materials such as iron, coal, copper, wood, and many others is steadily increasing. With our mining sector already established, it will be difficult to find entirely new ore veins yet untapped, and we can't simply rely on luck.\n\nTo this end, we'll increase resource production quotas. By funding the acquisition of more modern machineries, improving mining crew training, and creating a new culture of stakhanovism, we'll maximize the output of our current mining facilities, reducing costs across the board: socialism is the way forward!"
 NIK_suslov_new_industrial_centers_desc:0 "Our main cities have developed nicely ever since we began our re-industrialization plan. However, relying too much on few large industrial nodes would make ourselves vulnerable: if twenty years of Luftwaffe bombings have taught us anything, diversifying production, and spreading out our industry, is the only way to keep going under duress.\n\nAs an additional benefit, funding the expansion and conversion of large agricultural towns into proper industrial cities will offer work to even more unemployed or poor people, and spread the ideals of socialism to the farthest reaches of our domain. From today, we start building the Soviet Union of tomorrow!"
 NIK_suslov_towards_a_stable_currency_desc:0 "While the final goal of socialism and communism is the eventual abolition of the currency, to be replaced with a just system where everyone gives what he can give to the state and receives what he needs from the community, we all know there's still a long way to go until we can even start to think about this. As such, we need to keep a currency, if only to trade with outside and to not impoverish the poor even more.\n\nThe Ruble of the Soviet Union has been kept as our official currency during these troubled times, but it has been devalued so much it no longer has any meaningful value: if we want a stable economy, we need to enact a comprehensive monetary reform to stabilize the currency and peg its value to fixed indexes decided by the state."
 NIK_suslov_the_road_to_recovery_desc:0 "To say that the Soviet Union has endured difficult times would be the secretary general of understatements. We have been subjected to twenty years of plundering, bombings, civil wars, famine, diseases, and every kind of disaster that could befall human civilization. If recovery was a road, it would be longer than the Trans-Siberian railroad!\n\nWith our efforts and our faith in socialism, however, we have finally turned the tables. While it will still take years - perhaps decades - to return to true prosperity, we have achieved admirable results in our quest for reconstruction: the people are no longer famished, and our industries are filled with hard-working crews proud of their role within society.\n\nOne day, we'll restore the Soviet Union to what it was before, just you wait!"
 NIK_suslov_the_soviet_education_system_desc:0 "One of the greatest changes the Soviet Union brought was free basic education for all. Under the Tzars, peasants weren't allowed to study in order to keep them forever under the nobles' thumb: with education comes innovation, and with innovation comes power!\n\nSadly, twenty years of civil strife and German bombings have destroyed the old education system in both a physical and metaphorical sense. With schools razed to the ground, and children forced to work to feed themselves and their families, learning has become a secondary, or even tertiary concerns.\n\nWe shall no longer tolerate such injustice! Our children need to learn so that they may improve both themselves and Mother Russia: we shall rebuild the old schools, and teach a new generation of young boys and girls the value of culture, and through it, how to be an outstanding Soviet citizen!"
 NIK_suslov_an_ideological_education_desc:0 "The traditional teaching methods and subjects are fine for elementary schools. Superior education, however - especially universities - needs to adapt to the new times, or we risk stagnation.\n\nBy introducing new study courses, and experimental curricula, we can revolutionize our education and help our students find what they excel at. Revolutionary minds produce revolutionary ideas, and the Soviet Union is the very embodiment of the concept of revolution!"
 NIK_suslov_expand_vocational_schools_desc:0 "Vocational schools teach young students with clear ideas about their future all about a single craft. While entrenched intellectuals consider them somewhat inferior to traditional universities, we are not as blind as them: from their classes come the next generations of artisans, engineers, farmers and bureaucrats, professions upon which lay the very foundation of a country!\n\nWe shall increase foundings to vocational schools, and give those brave boys and girls the best possible education. With it, they will be able to excel, and through it, they will elevate the Soviet Union to new heights of innovation and power: we all serve the nation, and we all deserve the best for it!"
 NIK_suslov_an_innovative_union_desc:0 "Gone are the days of decadence and backwardness. Gone are the fields tended by farmers and the factories where workers toiled with obsolete farmers. Gone are the child-workers and the empty classrooms. This is a new Russia, a new Union, where progress, for both the nation and the people, reigns supreme.\n\nWe have done so much, but we still have much more to do. The past is no longer stalking us, and now we are the ones chasing the future: new investments in science and education will send us barreling into a new era of progress!"

 NIK_suslov_restore_the_red_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago."
 NIK_suslov_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery. "
 NIK_suslov_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_suslov_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_suslov_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_suslov_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_suslov_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 NIK_suslov_doctrinal_refinement_desc:0 "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_suslov_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_suslov_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 NIK_suslov_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_suslov_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force.The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_suslov_the_red_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

 NIK_suslov_returning_to_the_world_desc:0 "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that Socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 NIK_suslov_restore_international_trade_desc:0 "The White Sea now lies open to us, and yet we still have no proper fleet to conduct international trade with. The nature of the arctic waters makes this task more difficult than it would seem. The port of Arkhangelsk is almost entirely frozen over during the winter months, and thus our merchant marine will require a specialized fleet of icebreakers to clear a path through to our trade partners.\n\nAccording to our foreign office, the nations of Scandinavia are already quite receptive to our offers of establishing trade. Due to their close proximity to our ports, they would be a relatively hassle-free journey for our merchant fleets as long as they are able to circumvent the frigid conditions of the White Sea."
 NIK_suslov_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc:0 "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 NIK_suslov_contact_the_OFN_desc:0 "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the Socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 NIK_suslov_the_gateway_to_europe_desc:0 "Europe lies under a steel wall of Fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 NIK_suslov_the_swedish_diplomatic_mission_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_suslov_approach_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 NIK_suslov_an_english_embassy_desc:0 "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the Fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 NIK_suslov_open_the_rykov_conference_desc:0 "The Soviet Union was once the bulwark of the global Socialist cause, sponsoring their comrades from around the world no matter where they came from. Ever since the collapse, however, this mantle has gone unclaimed for nearly two decades. With a Socialist government restored to West Russia, we must regain the initiative.\n\nThe idea has been floated of holding a conference in Rykov in the interest of fostering relations with Socialist parties from across the globe and reaffirming our commitment to the international worker. Representatives from hundreds of countries would be invited to attend, and discuss how to proceed with advancing our mutual goals. This conference will hopefully reestablish our government as the preeminent Socialist power and a friend to the workers of the world."
 NIK_suslov_propose_the_socintern_desc:0 "The Rykov Conference was a good first step to reestablishing solidarity with fellow Socialists from around the world, but we can go even farther. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Socialist International has been proposed. Like the ComIntern that came before it, the SocIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the SocIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"

 NIK_bukharina_a_triumph_for_the_soviets_desc:0 "At last, socialism has reigned supreme in Russia and in the way the Soviets intended. However, we must ensure that the regime does not become a vast, endless bureaucracy of Communist Party officials all governing thanks to fear of the leader striking down upon them.\n\nWith its reunification, West Russia provides an excellent opportunity to experiment and prove the effectiveness of true council communism. The workers' councils, the original soviets, will be restored to their positions of power, and they will be the ones to make decisions through a reformed system of government. No one is denying that this won't be an easy task, but this is why the General Secretary has assembled a team of the best people ready to get down to work and restore true socialism."
 NIK_bukharina_assemble_the_presidium_desc:0 "To give power to the workers, a system of a bicameral legislature has been conceived by General Secretary Bukharina. The Congress of Soviets will be a large body for which hundreds of soviet representatives, hard workers from all across free Russia, are elected. They, in turn, vote on the members of the Presidium, the upper house as westerners would call it. Presidium members are to be carefully proposed by the General Secretary herself, as they will need to be capable of fulfilling their role as her chief advisors and planners.\n\nThere are many possible candidates for Presidium members - others are officials from the old Union prepared to serve it once again, while others are young, rising stars with great ambitions. Only the best will be chosen, and they will be assigned with tasks important if we are to reach our former glory."
 NIK_bukharina_soviet_humanism_desc:0 "It is no secret that the USSR of old was ... not exactly a champion of human rights. General Secretary Bukharina recognizes this, and knows of the events that took place in the interwar period in Russia. However, it will be the goal of the new regime to change the public perception of itself, from an allegedly totalitarian state to one of equality and opportunity.\n\nIn the age of communication, it has never been easier to spread a message through radio and on television. The government will use that to its advantage, and reaffirm to its people and to the world that it is dedicated to the principles of humanism, and to an egalitarian society different from the failed Union. Once we have done that, we can begin to make sure it becomes the reality on the ground, and a new era for the nation will be ushered in."
 NIK_bukharina_a_free_woman_desc:0 "The fact that a woman is the leader of the state is already a testament to the equal opportunities presented by the new Union, but it is not quite enough. As per the General Secretary's wish, steps will be taken in the direction of gender equality within the framework of the socialist state. To begin with, a committee will be formed of special advisors from both genders on Comrade Bukharina's orders, and its purpose will be none other than to support social equality and solve any disputes in that regard. From there, it will be a process of gradually getting laws and amendments passed, so that women may finally be free and equal to men in the workplace, at home, and in society as a whole."
 NIK_bukharina_a_free_worker_desc:0 "The goal of a communist state is, above all, to guarantee the freedom and the power of the common worker. The government understands this, and will immediately begin taking progressive measures with said goal in mind. Primitive laws on workers' rights already exist, but they are often not optimal or are not followed in certain areas. These laws will be reformed and codified as per the wishes of the Congress and the Presidium, while those who do not follow them are to be punished accordingly. In addition, the changes will be publicized through media, so that everyone learns of the leaps the new Union has made."
 NIK_bukharina_return_to_kollontai_desc:0 "Alexandra Kollontai, as one of the few female Old Bolsheviks, is considered an early champion of women's rights and for good reason. She spearheaded the idea of Marxist feminism, the idea that true gender equality in all aspects can only be achieved as a result of a socialist revolution like the one the Bolsheviks planned and eventually executed.\n\nWhile that may not have been completely achieved, it is now Comrade Bukharina's will and our duty to continue Kollontai's legacy. Her ideology will not only be accepted, but we shall bake it into law as a not insignificant part of the new Union's ideology and policy. Therefore, we will assure Russia is entrenched as a champion of equality and one of the first nations to truly confront the matter."
 NIK_bukharina_a_culture_of_questioning_desc:0 "The Russians and other ethnicities inside our borders are often defined by century-old traditions and moral codes. However, what do they matter if all they do is hold us back and prevent progress comparable to the rest of the world? Lenin and Bukharin started launched the idea of questioning these long-lasting traditions as they occasionally proved to be hurdles in the development of society, but never finished it. The warlord era was another blow to these new ideas, but we are here to fix that.\n\nThe General Secretary and the Presidium have agreed on a course of action through which the state will encourage rethinking these ancient cultural trends. An abundance of speeches and propaganda will help to achieve much-needed progress."
 NIK_bukharina_empower_the_councils_desc:0 "As the next step in giving the workers more power over their jobs, the local soviets across the country will be trusted with a certain level of control and self-autonomy. They will be allowed to set forth their own candidates for representation, as well as be the ones who decide quotas for production and several other measures that deal with their own workplace.\n\nOf course, the Presidium understands that no group can be completely trustworthy when they have control, and for that reason the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation will be useful. As the service to ensure everything runs smoothly, they will be observing the different factories and councils, seeking any dishonest men and women who would dare lie about their reports and work."
 NIK_bukharina_open_the_government_desc:0 "Open the Government"
 NIK_bukharina_for_your_own_good_desc:0 "A free society is important, but the government cannot always be liberal with its recordkeeping. If the security of the state is compromised, even for ostensibly pure reasons, then all will be in danger. As such, we cannot make government records public. This is especially true for information pertaining to state security. It may not be popular, but the people will understand that it is for their own good."
 NIK_bukharina_declare_an_extraordinary_session_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of resurgent Russia to combat any remaining counter-revolutionary movements, some cells and underground groups still linger and remind us of the days of the Komi Republic's turbulent politics. Suslovite and Zhdanovite supporters continue to exist both among the citizens of the country and in some cases inside the government, perhaps plotting to overthrow it.\n\nThis cannot stand. The Presidium, responsible for governing the country, and the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation, responsible for keeping it safe, will convene as soon as possible to discuss solutions to this urgent matter. Under the supervision of the General Secretary, their task for the near future will be to eliminate the last threats to the state, so that we can move forward."
 NIK_bukharina_a_loyal_police_force_desc:0 "Our past of cooperation with Suslovite and Zhdanovite elements still haunts us, as they have contacts in important positions even to this day. For example, the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation - a body meant to serve the government and protect its people - has possibly been infiltrated by these revisionists, and must now be reformed.\n\nTrusted men and women, who have stood on the side of the General Secretary since the early days, will be put in charge of the operation to identify and purge any possible dissidents and agents. Anyone deemed disloyal inside the URS will be discharged, and if their treason to the state is proven, tried for their crimes. Only through a clean police force will the revolution be able to survive and expand."
 NIK_bukharina_blind_the_ultravisionaries_desc:0 "The strange and esoteric ideas of the Ultravisionaries are, ultimately, dangerous to the welfare and security of the state. It is clear that Zhdanov's faction must be dealt with. Known members will be expelled from government office, their leaders will be discredited in the court of public opinion, and they will be watched carefully for the rest of their lives. This bizarre cult will be excised, as cleanly and decisively as possible."
 NIK_bukharina_shackle_the_dogmatists_desc:0 "Mikhail Suslov's hardline faction has been sidelined, and Suslov himself removed from the equation entirely. However, we still need to deal with many of its members who remain in public office. They need not be purged as thoroughly as Zhdanov's people, but we still must remove them from positions of power. A few retirements here, and a few reassignments there. The old dogmatists must not be able to threaten our efforts."
 NIK_bukharina_peace_at_last_desc:0 "At last, our position in the government is secure. The esotericists and hardliners have been removed from power, and any threat that they would pose to us has been effectively neutralized. We still need to ensure that those in government who have voiced concerns are properly dealt with, but after some stern messaging, they should get the picture. Our republic has been united under the left, and we may move towards a better future for all."
 NIK_bukharina_the_march_to_utopia_desc:0 "With our republic's new government united and strong, we can begin the march towards the utopia of the future. We will create a society of total social equality, justice for all, unity among all the working peoples of the world, and where true Communism has been finally achieved, once and for all. The workers of our republic will control their destinies, our scientists will design a new future for humanity, our farmers and agronomists will feed a hungry world, and our brave soldiers will defend the people's revolution, come what may. What began in the salons of Switzerland and the backrooms of Syktyvkar will reach the hearts and minds of all humanity. Utopia is on the horizon, and we will reach it!"
 
 NIK_bukharina_an_economy_of_the_people_desc:0 "The fall of the USSR during the First Patriotic War was, among many other things, caused by the flaws in its economic system. While our predecessors surely tried their best at organizing a socialist economy, in the end they failed due to both technological and ideological limitations.\n\nIf we are to rebuild Russia, we need to create a functional economy, where the citizen receives from the state what he or she needs, and gives in return his loyalty and his work. With such reforms, we'll be one step ahead of our competitors, and we'll create a country both powerful and fair!"
 NIK_bukharina_learning_from_the_past_desc:0 "Despite his faults - and ultimate failure - Bukharin had great ideas and great plans for the Soviet Union. While we intend to surpass him, it would be foolish to simply discard all his work: instead, we'll learn from his reforms, and salvage what good he did so that he may serve the Motherland even after his passing.\n\nBy studying his Siberian Development Plan, focusing on infrastructural innovations and subsidizing light industry, we'll be able to boost our economy and dramatically increase our industrial base, which will greatly benefit both the people and the country as a whole."
 NIK_bukharina_a_union_of_workers_desc:0 "Rather than the German-held industries, where slaves toil and die in both cruel and inefficient ways, we aim to free the worker by granting him not only a fair salary, but the knowledge he needs to improve both his standing and his productivity.\n\nIf we instruct our factory crews on the latest advancements in industrial production methods, we'll create a loyal and skilled workforce, and make a great leap forward in our quest to save Mother Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_and_a_union_of_peasants_desc:0 "One of the greatest mistakes of the Soviet Union was its excessive reliance on industrial cities. The people need to eat as much as they need in order to be both healthy and loyal, and in the larger scheme of things, a famine can be as much as a catastrophe as any military defeat.\n\nBy providing our farmers with modern machinery subsidized by the state, and teaching them how to properly use and maintain them, agricultural output will increase tenfolds. An army marches on its stomach, and this is valid for countries too!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_special_developmental_commission_desc:0 "Russia is vast, and there are large swathes of land full of yet untapped potential. Natural resources waiting to be exploited, fertile land abandoned, and broken infrastructure can be found all across the Motherland, and even within the part that we control.\n\nBy establishing a commission tasked with the individuation and development of such areas is of paramount importance if we are to establish ourselves as serious contenders for the unification of Russia: failure won't be tolerated, nor forgiven!"
 NIK_bukharina_urban_industrial_development_desc:0 "Our cities have been hit hard by the fall of the Soviet Union and the subsequent German bombings. Thousands of people live in huts as their homes have been destroyed, and damaged power lines and industrial machinery jeopardize our production efforts.\n\nWithout industry, there is no Soviet Union, which means that we have to restore our cities and industrial hubs to their former glory. Repairing urban areas, restoring electric power and kickstarting our industry will slowly but surely bring us back into shape, and the people will surely appreciate it."
 NIK_bukharina_integrate_regional_infrastructure_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the Soviet Union, many warlords and disloyal officers have claimed pieces of Russia as their own. Throughout the years, roads, railroads and power lines were disrupted, repaired, sabotaged, rebuilt and destroyed again by a variety of different actors: as a result, emergency repairs and lack of standardization plague our country and cripple our economy.\n\nBy instituting a new and uniform set of standards - especially in rail gauge - we'll be able to slowly integrate the infrastructures scattered across Komi, and it will be a starting point for our future endeavors should we be able to expand and reclaim the lost lands of the Soviet Union."
 NIK_bukharina_rural_agricultural_development_desc:0 "Now that we have set the basis by teaching our farmers about the modern agricultural production methods, we can bring this a step forward by establishing a concerted development effort for our farmlands.\n\nBy subsidizing larger infrastructures such as aqueducts and irrigation channels, that individual farmers would never be able to affort, we can not only increase our agricultural output, but also foster a sense of gratitude among those who will benefit from our efforts. We serve Mother Russia through its people!"
 NIK_bukharina_resource_extraction_initiatives_desc:0 "With our preliminary investments completed, we can now start a serious resource extraction program. Newer infrastructure and improved working methods are a nice start, but in the end they can't change the situation on their own: the state needs to intervene with more subsidies.\n\nBy granting our mines with state funds to buy the latest extraction machines, and directly linking our railroad system to each production facility, we'll increase efficiency across the board, speeding up extraction and cutting the costs. We need everything we can get to save Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_industrial_farming_methods_desc:0 "We have already done much for our agricultural sector, but we can do even more. Our Motherland is cold in weather, but warm in maternal instinct: if we want to truly rebuild Russia, we must care for everyone, and providing food is the first and essential step.\n\nTo this end, we shall increase investments into farming machinery, build even more advanced and dedicated infrastructure, and employ the latest technologies in seed selection and intensive farming. By our effort, we shall turn every corner of our land into verdant fields!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_ideal_synthesis_desc:0 "Finally, our efforts are bringing results. Industrial and agricultural production have increased by several orders of magnitude, and the people thank us for their newly-found prosperity: our lands have been healed from the scars inflicted by war, and we have recovered from our backward methods.\n\nHowever, this isn't enough.\n\nThe Soviet Union we desire does not follow, it leads! We can't be satisfied with copying what others invented, therefore we shall return to the forefront of innovation: our scientists and engineers will work without rest to discover newer and more advanced production methods, so that we may forever be one step aheads of our rivals, both inside and outside Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_soviet_education_system_desc:0 "One of the greatest changes the Soviet Union brought was free basic education for all. Under the Tzars, peasants weren't allowed to study in order to keep them forever under the nobles' thumb: with education comes innovation, and with innovation comes power!\n\nSadly, twenty years of civil strife and German bombings have destroyed the old education system in both a physical and metaphorical sense. With schools razed to the ground, and children forced to work to feed themselves and their families, learning has become a secondary, or even tertiary concerns.\n\nWe shall no longer tolerate such injustice! Our children need to learn so that they may improve both themselves and Mother Russia: we shall rebuild the old schools, and teach a new generation of young boys and girls the value of culture, and through it, how to be an outstanding Soviet citizen!"
 NIK_bukharina_experimental_curricula_desc:0 "The traditional teaching methods and subjects are fine for elementary schools. Superior education, however - especially universities - needs to adapt to the new times, or we risk stagnation.\n\nBy introducing new study courses, and experimental curricula, we can revolutionize our education and help our students find what they excel at. Revolutionary minds produce revolutionary ideas, and the Soviet Union is the very embodiment of the concept of revolution!"
 NIK_bukharina_expand_vocational_schools_desc:0 "Vocational schools teach young students with clear ideas about their future all about a single craft. While entrenched intellectuals consider them somewhat inferior to traditional universities, we are not as blind as them: from their classes come the next generations of artisans, engineers, farmers and bureaucrats, professions upon which lay the very foundation of a country!\n\nWe shall increase foundings to vocational schools, and give those brave boys and girls the best possible education. With it, they will be able to excel, and through it, they will elevate the Soviet Union to new heights of innovation and power: we all serve the Union, and we all deserve the best for it!"
 NIK_bukharina_an_innovative_union_desc:0 "Gone are the days of decadence and backwardness. Gone are the fields tended by farmers and the factories where workers toiled with obsolete farmers. Gone are the child-workers and the empty classrooms. This is a new Russia, a new Union, where progress, for both the nation and the people, reigns supreme.\n\nWe have done so much, but we still have much more to do. The past is no longer stalking us, and now we are the ones chasing the future: new investments in science and education will send us barreling into a new era of progress!"

 NIK_bukharina_restore_the_red_army_desc:0 "Our Red Army is still a relatively new institution. Formed in the chaos following the coup that brought Socialist rule to Komi, the current military force is only intended to be just good enough to carry out offensive operations without collapsing in on itself due to a lack of organization.\n\nUnfortunately, "good enough" simply won't cut it. The enemies of Socialism grow in strength all around us, and already pose a greater threat than any foe we faced during the unification wars. To better prepare ourselves for the inevitable wars of the future, The Red Army must be restored to its former glory; a professional fighting force that resembles the very same army that once stood on the frontlines against Fascist tyranny many years ago."
 NIK_bukharina_lessons_from_the_second_patriotic_war_desc:0 "The Second Patriotic War, also known as the West Russian War, was the last and most recent conflict involving the united forces of Russia. The Red Army's mighty offensive very nearly broke the back of the Fascists, driving them from the A-A Line and putting their entire front on the verge of collapse. Yet, despite being on the very cusp of victory, military setbacks and traitors alike stole the victory right out of their hands.\n\nWe shall study the various tactics and strategies used by both sides. The Second Patriotic War was in many ways a herald of wars to come, with all parties involved utilizing never-before-seen methods of warfare. The overwhelming offensive launched by the Red Army in particular is worth studying, as well as the Fascists' miraculous recovery."
 NIK_bukharina_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "The world has not become any more peaceful since the period of stagnation that followed the Second Patriotic War, and already the great powers of the world throw their weight around in various proxy wars around the globe. These smaller-scale conflicts have already seen the use of all kinds of tactical innovation. In that case, perhaps it would be prudent to study the strategies used in these wars and find ways to adapt them for our own purposes?\n\nIn particular, the South African War has caught the interest of the Red Army's command staff. This bloody proxy conflict saw bold new concepts such as airmobile infantry and asymmetric warfare used by both sides, and served as a glimpse of what a true modern war could be. The lessons that were demonstrated in the hills and jungles of Africa could very well apply to the forests and tundra of Russia as well."
 NIK_bukharina_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "West Russia is united under the red banner once more, but the road to get to this point was bloody indeed. The wars to bring the region under control saw some of the bloodiest fighting since the Second Patriotic War. Despite the Red Army's victory, the constant warfare exposed some serious flaws that will need to be addressed before we continue the reunification.\n\nEach warlord the Red Army crushed used different strategies and organized their forces in a unique fashion. We will take into account all the forces we encountered, and see if we can't incorporate their strengths into our own forces whilst avoiding their weaknesses."
 NIK_bukharina_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "It is often said that no plan survives first contact with the enemy, and this was no more apparent than in the Unification Wars. Despite having detailed strategies in place for dealing with our enemies, more often than not unexpected developments would leave our command staff floundering and unable to react in time. All the while, our units on the field suffered while their officers panicked trying to determine what to do next.\n\nThese individual disasters could've been easily avoided had we implemented a more flexible system of unit tactics. More autonomy shall be given to the officers in the field, who will be trusted to improvise should the chain of command break down in the heat of battle. Instead of relying upon orders from on high, officers shall instead count on their own initiative, and the tactics utilized by individual units."
 NIK_bukharina_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Our efforts are paying off. The Red Army is beginning to closely resemble the very same force that crossed the A-A Line into Fascist-occupied territories nearly a decade ago, finally bearing the makings of a professional military. However, the truth is that we have not gone far enough. Our current Red Army would've been considered top notch in decades past, but is hardly up to modern standards.\n\nThe General Secretary has approved a massive increase in funding for the Red Army, intended to aid with more intensive modernization efforts. No longer shall we lag behind the rest of the world! Through the application of cutting-edge modern technologies and intuitive new tactics, the Red Army shall transform into a force ready to face the modern battlefield."
 NIK_bukharina_the_kazan_military_academy_desc:0 "Kazan is home to one of nine "Suvorov Schools" that were created during the Bukharin era. These specialized boarding schools were intended to provide young men with a secondary, military-focused education, and as such, many of the Red Army's officers started their careers in these schools. Ever since the unfortunate collapse of the Soviet Union, however, the school in Kazan had gone mostly unused.\n\nWe shall renovate this building and reopen a new institution in its place: the Kazan Military Academy. Rather than being intended for secondary education, this new academy will be created with the express purpose of training new officers for the Red Army. Once Kazan's academy has been reestablished, we can begin creating the next generation of the Red Army's officer corps."
 NIK_bukharina_doctrinal_refinement_desc:0 "The needs of a modern battlefield change at the blink of an eye, and if one is not careful they can find themselves falling behind the curve sooner than they'd think. Despite our best efforts, however, the doctrines in use by the Red Army are still hopelessly trapped in the past. If action is not taken soon, our enemies would surely run circles around us!\n\nThe time has come to analyze our strategies and refine them to be more suitable for a contemporary conflict. Not only must we bring the Red Army up to modern standards, but we must also keep a sharp eye towards the doctrines of the future. After all, working to maintain a clear advantage over our potential foes is paramount to achieving victory."
 NIK_bukharina_the_revolutionary_soldier_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is the rank-and-file who make up the beating heart of the Red Army. The soldiers of the Soviet Union were, at one time, legendary for both their devotion to the Socialist cause and their unflinching tenacity in battle. Our own troops are certainly not lacking in either of these aspects, and it would help to further encourage such professional ideals for the new recruits as well.\n\nThe ideal vision of a truly revolutionary soldier must be realized once again. We need able men and women who are willing to undertake any sacrifice necessary for the Motherland, soldiers who would make the Red Army worthy of proclaiming themselves as the strongest!"
 NIK_bukharina_avtomat_kalashnikova_desc:0 "The AK-47 is a truly remarkable battle rifle. Capable of firing rifle-sized cartridges at 600 rounds per minute, the Kalashnikov has also gained a legendary reputation for reliability. The rifle can survive a tremendous level of punishment, and is able to survive in even the hardiest of conditions without encountering any sort of problems. On top of all of this, it is easy to maintain and relatively simple to manufacture.\n\nIt is said that you cannot improve perfection, but whoever coined that phrase has obviously never met a Russian weapons designer. We will begin trials on a new standard battle rifle for the Red Army, deriving from the tried-and-tested design of the AK-47. In time, our troops will hopefully get their hands on a weapon even more effective than the vaunted Kalashnikov."
 NIK_bukharina_reorganize_the_war_ministry_desc:0 "With the expansion of our territory comes an unavoidable increase in the number of officers needed by the Red Army's general staff. This would not be too much of an issue if not for the fact that the War Ministry is currently a chaotic mess, virtually unchanged from the days of the Komi Republic. This sorry state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. The War Ministry must be reorganized from the ground up to better serve the needs of a considerably larger area of operations.\n\nWith some extensive streamlining, it is believed that the chain of command will flow more smoothly. Generals will be able to receive any and all necessary information about combat readiness or battlefield conditions at a moments notice, enhancing their abilities to command our troops."
 NIK_bukharina_the_new_northern_fleet_desc:0 "We were restricted to a landlocked status during the Komi Republic days, which meant there was little practical need for a naval force.The situation has changed dramatically, however. With access to the sea secured via the critical port of Arkhangelsk, the time has come to organize the beginnings of a new Red Fleet.\n\nWhile the port is frozen over during the winter, it is nonetheless the most important port west of the Urals that still remains in Russian hands. Our navy will be tasked with the protection of this port rather than large-scale naval actions against enemy fleets, as we do not have the capability nor need to build a large armada of ships."
 NIK_bukharina_the_red_air_force_desc:0 "We still remember the dark months spent in the shadow of the Fascist terror bombing campaigns. Our only source of salvation was the brave exploits of the Free Aviators, but even they could not be everywhere at once. With the situation in West Russia stabilized for the time being, we must learn to stand on our own two feet in case the Luftwaffe returns to our skies.\n\nThe use of aircraft is nothing new to us, but without a proper military wing of their own, the potential of our wings is needlessly limited. Therefore, an independent air arm of the military, the Red Air Force, shall be created. To aid with the establishment of this new force, we shall expand key airbases under our control to house more aircraft, and begin development of modern aircraft to help dominate the sky."

 NIK_bukharina_returning_to_the_world_desc:0 "The dark days of the warlord era have finally come to an end, and our young nation has climbed out from the abyss to establish itself as a true regional power. In the past, we have had little need for our foreign ministry, as diplomacy in the warlord period usually involved the sword rather than the pen.\n\nThe world beckons. We now find ourselves in need of capable diplomats now more than ever. The foreign ministry must be expanded to meet the requirements of properly conducting international diplomacy, and they shall begin making contact with the nations of the globe as soon as they are able. Let all of the foreign powers know that Socialism has returned to Russia in earnest!"
 NIK_bukharina_restore_international_trade_desc:0 "The White Sea now lies open to us, and yet we still have no proper fleet to conduct international trade with. The nature of the arctic waters makes this task more difficult than it would seem. The port of Arkhangelsk is almost entirely frozen over during the winter months, and thus our merchant marine will require a specialized fleet of icebreakers to clear a path through to our trade partners.\n\nAccording to our foreign office, the nations of Scandinavia are already quite receptive to our offers of establishing trade. Due to their close proximity to our ports, they would be a relatively hassle-free journey for our merchant fleets as long as they are able to circumvent the frigid conditions of the White Sea."
 NIK_bukharina_trans_polar_diplomacy_desc:0 "To the untrained eye, the frozen wastes of the Arctic seem like nothing more than an insurmountable obstacle to any kind of fleet, the ice providing an inconvenience for the port of Arkhangelsk in the winter months. While this is not entirely false, the truth is that these frigid waters are among the only remaining gateways into West Russia still controlled by Russians. As such, it would be prudent to foster good relations with the various nations of the north.\n\nWe shall extend an olive branch across the polar territories. Scandinavian countries such as Finland and Sweden are to receive requests for diplomatic recognition, while the very first overtures towards the nations of the OFN shall be sent to Iceland and Canada. No country is outside of our reach, even if they lie beyond the treacherous waters of the Arctic."
 NIK_bukharina_contact_the_OFN_desc:0 "In most ordinary circumstances, the Organization of Free Nations would be our greatest adversary. The United States has long established itself the vanguard of predatory capitalism, staunchly opposed to the Socialist cause in every way imaginable. These are, however, not ordinary circumstances.\n\nThe black tides of Hitlerism have washed over Europe, leaving only a path of death and destruction. Even the Soviet Union was not spared from the aggression of the Fascists, and now our very heartland lies at their mercy. We will need allies if we are to overcome this threat, and the OFN are the only international alliance who share this goal. A message shall be sent to the OFN in good faith, requesting their diplomatic recognition. With luck, this agreement shall be the first step towards further cooperation, even if we are hesitant to work too closely with these capitalists."
 NIK_bukharina_the_gateway_to_europe_desc:0 "Europe lies under a steel wall of Fascism, but there are many ways to pierce this barrier if one knows where to look. In particular, our neighbors in Finland provide a convenient avenue for this purpose. Relations have not exactly been warm due to past tensions, but perhaps it is still possible to reach common ground.\n\nWe will send a message to the Finns with a few polite requests. Firstly, we will ask for diplomatic recognition to further cement ourselves as the legitimate Russian government. Secondly, access to their ports will be requested. Although we control ports of our own, the fact remains that they are frozen over in the winter months, and have no access to the Baltic whatsoever. Land access to Finland's territories would solve this issue quite handily."
 NIK_bukharina_the_swedish_diplomatic_mission_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few European nations that has yet to fall under the sinister influence of Nazism, retaining its status as fully independent democracy. Their neutrality during the Second World War may have been seen by some as cowardice, but in the end it meant the complete preservation of their sovereignty.\n\nDiplomacy with the Swedes is paramount to our goals of establishing international relations, especially when one considers their proximity. A fully fledged diplomatic delegation is to be sent to Stockholm, with the goal of requesting their diplomatic recognition. Should they accept, we will be one step closer to establishing our government as a legitimate entity."
 NIK_bukharina_approach_free_norway_desc:0 "It would appear that the iron grip that Nazi Germany has over Europe is not nearly as tight as it seems. Norway was once ruled by an oppressive Nazi colonial government, their freedom cruelly denied by the Germans in their quest for total domination over their neighbors. Miraculously, the situation has made a dramatic reversal.\n\nThe Norwegians have finally thrown off their shackles and removed the Nazi regime from power, establishing an independent government in its place. They are now surrounded on nearly all sides by Fascist influence, and will need all the help they can get. We shall send a delegation to Free Norway offering military assistance in exchange for recognizing our government as the legitimate successor to the Soviet Union."
 NIK_bukharina_an_english_embassy_desc:0 "Even the proud English people were not spared from the advance of Nazi Germany, and following the Second World War a German-aligned government was imposed upon them. Luckily, it was not to last. The English have overthrown this illegitimate puppet regime and restored an independent state in bold defiance of the Fascists.\n\nTheir struggle is not over however, and many international observers have considered the possibility that the Germans may soon retaliate to reestablish dominion over England. Should this happen, we shall stand with them in the form of military aid. If they recognize our government, we will begin to send them as many weapons and munitions as we can spare."
 NIK_bukharina_open_the_rykov_conference_desc:0 "The Soviet Union was once the bulwark of the global Socialist cause, sponsoring their comrades from around the world no matter where they came from. Ever since the collapse, however, this mantle has gone unclaimed for nearly two decades. With a Socialist government restored to West Russia, we must regain the initiative.\n\nThe idea has been floated of holding a conference in Rykov in the interest of fostering relations with Socialist parties from across the globe and reaffirming our commitment to the international worker. Representatives from hundreds of countries would be invited to attend, and discuss how to proceed with advancing our mutual goals. This conference will hopefully reestablish our government as the preeminent Socialist power and a friend to the workers of the world."
 NIK_bukharina_propose_the_socintern_desc:0 "The Rykov Conference was a good first step to reestablishing solidarity with fellow Socialists from around the world, but we can go even farther. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Communist International that it had established had fallen into irrelevance, and eventually became defunct altogether. We must rekindle this flame, and create a new entity for encouraging global cooperation.\n\nA new Socialist International has been proposed. Like the ComIntern that came before it, the SocIntern will enable more effective economic and political cooperation between all the socialist parties of the world. Even in these dark times, the SocIntern shall ensure that the revolution will prevail no matter what trials lie ahead. Solidarity forever!"

Now that we govern West Russia and have transcended the simple borders of the old Komi Republic, it's time to hold [NIK.GetName]'s first official elections. For many West Russians, this will be their first free election. They are excited to head to the polls.\n\nThree parties have thrown their hats into the ring: The democratic socialist §PDSNP§! headed by [GetNIKSocDemLeader], the centrist §MPSD§! under Svetlana Stalina, and the liberal §YSMR§! fielding Alexei Kosygin. The 1968 elections are sure to be a close race, and whoever wins will decide the fate of West Russia for 4 more years. The race is on!"
 NIK_second_election_the_DSNP_campaign_desc:0 "[GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] isn't perfect, but he's perfect for West Russia. The working man in Russia has no better choice than the founder of modern Russian democracy. The DSNP blends the best of old Soviet socialism with new democratic institutions to create a democratic socialist party that protects workers' lives and liberties.\n\nThe DSNP will get a head start on their election campaign. [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] will criss-cross [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting his Presidential record and plans for the future. As many West Russians will be choosing him for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 NIK_second_election_tour_the_industrial_centers_desc:0 ""West Russians, workers, countrymen, you have been liberated. Some of you have been liberated from noblemen, juntas, and collaborators who expected you to work to make them richer. Some of you have been liberated from authoritarian communists who valued you only for your output as a line item in a centrally planned budget. But now you have a true friend in your government. Our party fights for you, not for your servitude. We fight that you may earn a fair wage for fair work, that you may feel secure from job precarity, and that you may retire with a well-deserved pension. We are the DSNP, and we are your party."\n\n[GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] will go on a speaking tour in factories across [NIK.GetName]. He will play to the party's industrial base and promote himself as a friend of the working class. By shoring up support from our core constituency, we should have a strong showing in the election."
 NIK_second_election_present_a_workers_agenda_desc:0 "Since many of our voters are new to our party, it would be wise to teach them what we stand for. West Russia needs to know what our ideology and policies are if we are to win a mandate in the 1968 elections.\n\nThe DSNP will publish their party platform across [NIK.GetName]. In it, they will detail their plans for wage, occupational safety, and pension reform. They will also make it clear that their ultimate goals are to reunify the whole of Russia and apply their pro-worker agenda across all of its regions. Nobody with a heart could oppose this platform!"
 NIK_second_election_the_PSD_campaign_desc:0 "[NIK.GetName] is a new and unstable country. Many of its people have only recently been amalgamated into it, and have never experienced a free election in their lives. The last thing they need is more utopian visions by ersatz wings of the old Center bloc. Only Svetlana Stalina's PSD can provide the order and stability that Russia so desperately craves.\n\nThe PSD will get a head start on their election campaign. Stalina will criss-cross [NIK.GetName] giving speeches promoting her commitment to political stability and moderate plans for reform. As many West Russians will be choosing her for the first time, this campaign will be crucial to securing their votes."
 NIK_second_election_a_platform_for_a_modern_russia_desc:0 "If the people of West Russia want anything, it's stability. Having experienced the collapse of the Union at the hands of the Nazis, control of their homes changing hands between different warlords again and again, and finally reunification under [NIK.GetName], they need an end to the chaos in their lives. They'll be glad to know that Stalina is just the woman for the job.\n\nThe PSD will publish its platform across the country. It will detail plans for rapid reclamation of the unliberated zones to restore the old Russia. It will mention their social democratic economic policies and protections for free speech, but will also emphasize their expansion of the military and police with an aim to create a safe and secure West Russia. This should capture the hearts of the many weary West Russians now joined to our republic."

Now that the Komi Republic has been transcended by [NIK.GetName] we can shed the shackles of the old Center bloc that kept the dream down; Alexei Kosygin and the SMR alone will make that dream come true.\n\nThe SMR will get a head start on their election campaign.

Most of all, it needs your courage to stand up to the old failures and create new successes. An SMR Russia is your Russia, and it will be the Russia of your grandchildren when you retire to a life of comfort and culture."\n\nKosygin will launch a speaking tour across [NIK.GetName]'s universities. He will campaign hard for the youth vote. While the youth may seem an odd choice of a support base, their dedication to him now will likely last their whole lives; Kosygin is nothing if not forward-thinking. This should help give us an edge in the 1968 elections."
 NIK_second_election_hope_for_a_radiant_future_desc:0 "Kosygin is the man with the plan. He always was ever since he'd saved Russian industry during the war by organizing the Eastward evacuation, and he's going to save [NIK.GetName] now with his extensive reforms. He will unveil to all the people of West Russia his blueprint for their future.\n\nThe SMR will publish their platform across [NIK.GetName]. It will detail their affirmative action plans for Russia's women and ethnic minorities, as well as their blueprint for expanding private enterprise to increase economic growth. While the platform will uphold the socialist roots of the SMR, it will portray them as focused first and foremost on the personal liberty and prosperity of every West Russian. This message should resonate with the electorate, many of whom will have their first taste of real freedom."
 NIK_second_election_let_the_race_begin_desc:0 "Campaigning season is over and [NIK.GetName] is heading to the polls. Each candidate put up a good fight, and analysts see this election as anyone's game. Russians will soon gather around their radio sets to hear the final tallies and find out who will lead their nation for the next 5 years: [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast]'s democratic socialists, Stalina's stability-minded centrists, or Kosygin's liberal democrats.\n\nMany will be elated by the results, others dismayed. Yet one thing all can agree on is that a free and fair election was finally held across West Russia; a triumph in a land that has never known a peaceful transfer of power. No matter who wins the most votes, democracy has won in [NIK.GetName]."

 ### DEMOCRATIC REGIONALS DESCS ###
 NIK_voznesensky_a_socialist_mandate_desc:0 "As Russia roils and bleeds around us, we must cling to the principles which have brought us this far: to the ideals of our Constitution. Not for us the tyranny of the Eurasianists, not for us the violence of the Communist Left, and not for us the falsehoods and demagoguery of radicalism! In this and only this do we place our trust: a dedication to Democratic Socialism, one which is beholden neither to the will of an iron hierarchy nor to the nightmarish callings of frenzied agitators.\nYes, Socialism! We dare use that term divorced from the tyrant-Bolsheviks of old, for unlike those who would plaster a Red Tsardom to their walls to keep them safe, we are not afraid of listening to the people - and we are not afraid of acting on what we hear. Only Socialism can keep us loyal to our people, and only Democracy can keep Socialism true to its course. There can be no other option."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_new_republic_desc:0 "The old Republic was broken by its own best intentions: as Social Democracy was built it absorbed the dregs of every ideology across the political spectrum. A paradox of tolerance was at work, where at every opportunity we promoted the principles that we held so dear, and at every opportunity radicals used our idealism to undermine our grip. Now, as the President consolidates his grip, we will have an opportunity to truly express our beliefs in a purified form.\n\nA form where all will truly breathe free without inconvenient enemies and their alluring agitation-politics. A form where the worst of Voznesensky's opponents, and without a doubt the Republic's enemies by extension, can be discredited once and for all. A new Republic - and a different Russia."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_free_electoral_commission_desc:0 "Electoral Commissions were a controversial introduction to the old Republic, as repeated efforts to suborn the legitimacy of these Commissions by our associated extremist fringes made every election a headache. That said, our elections are still in desperate need of neutral third-party observation to ensure that said extremist fringe never again regains a hold on our electoral scene. We will introduce a new Commission to solve these problems, one whose neutrality will be firmly guarded by the President and the Head of the Legislature to keep the powers of state in check.\n\nThere are some who claim that the Electoral Commission is in fact simply one more tool in our President's pocket, and that there are in fact widespread claims that the Commission is as steeped in money as its predecessor. These extremist calls will be disregarded as the treasonous claims they are. The truth is this: we are the instrument of the People's Will.\n\nThose that disagree are more than welcome to take it up with us in person."
 NIK_voznesensky_an_urban_rural_platform_desc:0 "Democracy in Russia is like navigating a tightrope - one is perpetually forced to navigate between two worlds, each with vastly different requirements and lived experiences. Just as Janus was two-faced, so too must we adopt a two-faced approach: to look to the world of the village and the world of the urbanite and balance both their needs. Thankfully, Vosnesensky's long experience in Government has given him an intuitive grasp on these two chambers of the heart of Russia.\n\nWe will adopt a mixed approach, pushing for the gradual integration of the economy through separate, equal development. The farmer shall be given an equal voice and support for his labor, on an equal platform with the laborer at the factory, and we shall push for the organization of a true Farmer-Labor working class that can stand as one despite their asymmetrical backgrounds. Only when the two chambers of the Russian Heart beat as one shall Russia be united!"
 NIK_voznesensky_stand_for_democracy_desc:0 "There are certain ideals for which we cannot afford to compromise: chief among them would be our oft-quoted support for true Democratic ideals. This is what separates us from the radical rabble to our left and right - our absolute, unyielding conviction that the people alone can decide their mandate, and that no group of stuffed suits should decide the course of the Nation alone. As such, we must develop a new mandate, a Compact with the People, that will appeal to the men and women of Russia. Their alienation must not be allowed to fester, lest it consume the body politic in the sickness of extremism.\n\nA healthy level of propagandization about just how committed we are, accompanied by quiet suppression of the remnants of the old extremist groups, will keep our citizens on the straight and narrow - and a rhetorical focus on progressive legislation will convince them that we are on their side. A carrot and stick approach might not be particularly sophisticated, but that is the beauty of politics, yes?"
 NIK_voznesensky_democratic_idealism_desc:0 "Just as the poets fled to Tomsk, so too did the tired and huddled masses to the old Republic - despite all that has happened here, we retain that essential spark of democratic energy, that infallible belief that our voices matter. This is what kept the Old Republic going, even as its institutions fell apart around us and the stresses of extremism dragged it into the muck - and it is this idealism that will empower us to build a new dream, stronger and better than the old.\n\nA push for unionism, continued efforts to weed out irregularities in our voting system, and the expansion of our voting system to ensure all walks of life will have an equal say in elections - we are writing into law our passion for Democracy, and our love shall spill onto the streets of our shared home. May Russia live and breathe free, for as long as we draw breath we shall never cease in pulling her towards the public good."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_united_government_desc:0 "For all our talk of democracy, a certain degree of electoral unity is necessary to ensure our legislative branch is not vulnerable to the attacks that crippled our forebears. We must strive for a government that is both attuned to the popular voice and unfettered in their capability to carry out that which is mandated to us. As such, we will continue the broad-based United Coalition strategy - the extremist elements which we collaborated with, however, will no longer be welcome.\n\nInstead, we will pull in diverse elements from all across society, creating a truly broad-based party capable of responding to popular demands. Unionists, soldiers and street-sweepers shall all have their voices heard in our Coalition, and minor parties pressured into upholding their interests as well - this might fragment the power of our opposition, but democracy is not about opposition, is it not? After all, it is not competition, but representation, that makes Russia great. Why would we ever change that?"
 NIK_voznesensky_a_party_consensus_desc:0 "If we are ever to get our Government in Order, our control of our own Party must be an overriding priority. The DSNP is a hidebound institution, having inherited much of our factionalist divides from the old era, and even though our opponents are firmly out of office we must ensure that secondary allegiances are wholly uprooted to keep the Party vital. Dedication to the common interest and our party platform will be strictly enforced on members and legislators, with dissent punished by expulsion.\n\nWe will also develop grassroots organizations to keep our party members loyal, developing community ties to local leadership that will sustain our members' electoral campaigns - this support comes with inevitable compromises, and even weakness to the influence of the Party on important issues, but it is all necessary to keep their best interests aligned with our own. Otherwise, what would be the point of the Party in the first place?"
 NIK_voznesensky_relentless_progress_desc:0 "The political position our party finds itself is already described by contemporaries as "Democratic Hegemony", with a majority of the seats ensuring us practically full control of the legislative, provided we avoid internal strife and the party acts as a single block. This has to lead many of our representatives to doubt the usefulness of the Democratic front and cooperation with rightists as a whole, seeing how there's no need for painful compromises when we can wrestle control of the legislative on our own.\n\nWhile this may be a controversial move to make, we might have to agree with these circles and start distancing ourselves from the other parties. After all, the people of Russia haven't given the DSNP a vote of confidence for it to be bogged down by uncooperative conservatives."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_doctrine_of_compromise_desc:0 "While the DSNP holds the dominant position in the Assembly, its status as the ruling party is secured by a rather small margin, with support from the other democratic parties often necessary to ensure an indisputable majority.\n\nThough a good portion of our own deputies is dissatisfied with this state of dependence on rightist politicians and factions to pass our own legislation, our leadership has to recognize the unfortunate truth, that maintaining the Democratic Front with moderate rightists is the only way to ensure unity of the political center, for without it the republic would fall to extremism."
 NIK_voznesensky_past_the_scandals_desc:0 "Though the DSNP is the guarantor of prosperity in the republic and the party that unified Western Russia under the banner of democracy, it has eventually become evident that the pedestal of popular support it's so used to enjoying is quite brittle. With every scandal as minor as a single bribe, the public perception of our apparatus shifts from praise to condemnation, and many say that since its ascension to power the party has been permeated with crooked bureaucrats and thieving executives.\n\nWhile over the years these scandals have become the new normal, as public opinion eventually stabilizes after each one, and any outrage so far has been relatively minor, eventually any of them might spiral out of control, and the ensuing political crisis may cost our party it's ruling place or even the permanent stability of the republic. To prevent such a disaster, we should improve our public image, which will ultimately secure genuine popular support we so desperately require. The recent reunification should serve well to be presented as the moment when the DSNP was reborn from a den of corruption that has abandoned its founding principles. Now it has become a truly democratic association struggling for popular welfare, that is built on the principles of honesty and open government.\n\nAs such, initiatives have been approved for local anti-corruption campaigns, showing the electorate that the party acknowledges its problems and is ready to fight them openly. Whether this will prove effective is another question entirely, though this will be the first step on the way to overcoming the distrust many feel towards the DSNP."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_populist_agenda_desc:0 "Not so long ago, in the disunited lands of Russia, populism was employed by many a warlord to justify their rule. As such, some view it as a natural tool of a cruel age, invented by despots to bamboozle their subjects.\n\nHowever, we in the halls of power clearly see the benefits of populism - promising a better future to the people, fostering unity between them and the government, and securing their trust in our mandate are all beneficial to democracy as much as to any would-be dictator. Let us cultivate healthy populism in our party program, ensuring popular support in our march to progress."
 NIK_voznesensky_an_all_russian_autonomy_commission_desc:0 "The territory of Russia, in the historical process of her expansion, has absorbed the lands of many ethnicities, their population varying from millions to mere hundreds, each with a culture, unlike the others. Since the days of the October revolution, Lenin's government, believing in the principles of self-determination, granted the peoples of the new Soviet Union significant autonomy, the legacy of which we still carry, our republic itself having emerged from the Komi ASSR.\n\nWith our authority now extending throughout all of Western Russia, "The Autonomy Question" as it came to be known, has become a more significant issue, with notable figures from various ethnicities dissatisfied with the current status quo. While outright secessionists are few and irrelevant, we could satisfy the wishes of moderate particularist circles by introducing a separate body to improve the status of minorities and serve as an intermediary between the central government and the autonomies in matters where direct control is unnecessary. While some criticize this as "soft separatism" and "subversion of ethnic equality", many agree that this is the only way to guard the many ethnicities of Russia from the tyranny of the majority."
 NIK_voznesensky_prioritize_majoritarian_concerns_desc:0 "As Russia always has been a multinational state, her many former governments left a number of ethnic policies for our republic to inherit, including Bolshevik self-rule in various autonomies, which we currently practice in a slightly amended form, adapted for our democratic system. Though intended to grant the needed freedoms to the minorities, since the unification many are expressing disapproval of this system, calling for even greater autonomy.\n\nThis notion, though fitting the DSNP's general line, has been met with staunch opposition in the Assembly, with some especially vocal critics branding it as "eroding the principle of universal equality the republic is built on, through giving the minorities undemocratic overrepresentation". Many of the more moderate deputies are abstaining from the direct debate, but are evidently opposed to shaking up the status quo. While we could still force the initiative through, it could undermine the party's stability, and perhaps even sabotage the democracy we struggled so much to build. As such, we better forget about this proposal as soon as possible and move on to more pressing matters."
 NIK_voznesensky_extend_social_welfare_desc:0 "One of the key elements of any socialist agenda, ours not being an exception, is the promise of welfare for citizens of the state. Many fought for us on the fields of battle and gave us their vote to ensure this better tomorrow for their children, and it's due time we honored this promise.\n\nWith the initial stage of the long-awaited Reunification complete, we have achieved precious peace, allowing us to turn the necessary attention inwards, to finally build a working system of social welfare for all."
 NIK_voznesensky_campaign_for_the_disadvantaged_desc:0 "Despite our recent general welfare campaign, many of our citizens remain in a powerless and downtrodden state, experiencing difficulties with integration into the Republic's social and political environment. The Reunification, though it brought democracy to the people of Russia robbed many of their old way of life, leaving them stranded on the border between conflicting values and realities of their new life.\n\nSuch people, when not shielded from uncalled hardships, often turn to more radical options, aiming to tear down the society they view as downtrodding. As such, before the disadvantaged turn into radicals and terrorists, we must lend them a helping hand in integration."
 NIK_voznesensky_a_shining_precedent_desc:0 "Though for years our rivals and critics argued that a functional democracy could not exist within the brutal realities of warlordism and banditry that plagued Russia since her defeat, our new republic has disproven this claim by the fact of its very existence! It withstood the onslaught of radicals within and without, right and left, and has carried the torch of popular freedom from the Volga and to the White Sea. Breaking the expectations of the cynical, it has triumphed in war as well as peace, fighting for progress across both the fields of battle and halls of government. Our efforts here have established a precedent, that will outlast any tyranny, for, in the hearts and minds of the people, our republic shall persist through the hardest of crises.\n\nThree hurrahs for Russia! Three hurrahs for Democracy!"

 NIK_stalina_the_reconstruction_government_desc:0 "Our government, tasked with the salvation of the Republic, and eventually - Russia, has secured the West of the country, and it is now our duty to protect it from threats within and without. We shall do all in our power to wipe out extremists, restore prosperity and stability in the lives of our citizens, and eventually step down, leaving Russia united and free.\n\nThis herculean mission will not be finished in a day, a month, or perhaps even in years, but Russia's history has taught us that rallied under a strong authority, she overcame countless challenges before, and we are here to ensure she shall do so again."
 NIK_stalina_strengthen_the_institutions_desc:0 "Our main task, other than securing stability, is to ensure that the new democracy that will arise in the place of our Emergency Government, never meets the fate of the old one, crushed by shady backroom deals, informal agreements, intrigue, and powerplays beyond competency.\n\nIf we are to establish a New Republic, then at its center must stand legitimate institutions backed by public trust, with their offices having strictly defined limits of power and authority, so that biased and informal cliques will shackle Russia no longer."
 NIK_stalina_crack_down_on_corruption_desc:0 "Unfortunately for our cause, even an apparatus tasked with saving democracy itself is not immune to corruption. Thankfully, with the broadened powers granted to the emergency government under the pretext of national salvation will allow us to confront crooks and thieves directly, in these trying times, when corruption is little less than treason and should be stamped out, lest it finishes the republic in its moment of weakness."
 NIK_stalina_a_stabilizing_thaw_desc:0 "It seems our promise to eventually restore democracy was perceived quite differently by the populace, with some circles already making demands to start gradual liberalization in their areas of interest, arguing that the worst is behind us.\n\nWhile a few hardliners and military figures disagree, honoring a popular request will yield us much-needed credibility as a government on guard of democracy, and loosening press censorship and the like will help maintain the normality of life in a free society."
 NIK_stalina_a_supervised_state_desc:0 "With us explicitly defining the Reconstruction Government as a temporary measure to protect the republic's democracy, the rapidly rising campaigns to reintroduce freedoms have only begun to get in the way of our decision-making. While most of those groups are harmless, some movements, particularly those for the reintroduction of press freedoms, are particularly outspoken critics, and thus cannot be ignored.\n\nThough some are calling to listen to those demands, it would be more rational to silence them with a decisive refusal - liberalizing now would only defeat the point of the state of emergency by giving forces aiming to destabilize the nation a legal means of distributing their agitation. For as long as the Reconstruction Government holds, we'll have to maintain those restrictions in the name of stability and safety of our citizens."
 NIK_stalina_the_militarys_approval_desc:0 "Though the Emergency Government was largely formed by an agreement between Stalina's supporters in the National Assembly, and pro-democratic officers subordinated to Grigorenko, the two have since acted independently of each other, only cooperating explicitly in the initial securing of power.\n\nIf we are to move forward, we'll have to tighten the cooperation between those who protect the Republic in the halls of government and those who do their duty in the army. Thankfully, Stalina's close friendship with Grigorenko can help coerce him into directing the army to support the initiatives of the Government directly, cracking down on radicals and ensuring stability in the streets. Of course, this agreement will not be like the unspoken alliances of plotting bureaucrats in the old republic, with the military's full subordination to the president being formally codified."
 NIK_stalina_the_renewed_defense_of_the_republic_act_desc:0 "In order to maintain a strong enough army to unify all of Russia, we need to increase conscription. Unfortunately, we are facing a problem regarding conscription. Several loopholes exist in our conscription laws that allow many of our able-bodied citizens to avoid being conscripted.\n\nAs such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have decided to draft a new piece of legislation, the Defense of the Republic Act. this ensures that our citizens can't exploit loopholes to get out of service. Alongside dealing with loopholes, the Defense of the Republic Act renews the four-year conscription periods. If we are to reunite the Motherland, we need all hands on deck."
 NIK_stalina_the_national_sovereignty_act_desc:0 "Russia possesses many strategic resources, the most valuable to our government being oil. However, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government feel that we give out these resources too easily, allowing them to fall into the hands of our enemies. This is absurd, and something has to be done to rectify this matter.\n\nIntroducing the National Sovereignty Act. This law severely limits the exports of strategic resources to nations without defensive ties to the Motherland. In short, if a nation wants our resources, they must declare themselves an ally of the Russian Republic. This shall make the Russian Republic a more attractive ally to nations within the international community, and will help protect the Motherland. At the end of the day, that is all that matters."
 NIK_stalina_the_executive_directive_act_desc:0 "During times of crisis, the nation can't stop to wait for the mire of bureaucracy. As such, President Stalina - through the recently created Executive Directive Act - has been granted the ability to issue directives to handle any crisis that threatens national security unilaterally.\n\nThis allows President Stalina to govern quickly and efficiently, side-stepping all of the red tape that would normally impede her actions. Some may protest this further centralization of power, but the Executive Directive Act is a necessary step towards the goal of a united Motherland. President Stalina guided the Republic through a time of crisis once before, and she will likely have to do so repeatedly in the future. Our enemies will not wait patiently for our government to come to a consensus."
 NIK_stalina_the_party_registry_act_desc:0 "It is clear to the Reconstruction Government that the organizations that are allowed to participate in our government must be more thoroughly vetted in order to safeguard the Republic. As such, President Stalina has approved the Party Registry Act.\n\nAll political parties and organizations that wish to operate within the Republic must be officially approved and investigated, to ensure that they are not affiliated with extremist groups. This process shall be carried out by a wholly impartial and unbiased state-run body. While it may be staffed solely with former PSD members, these men and women have sworn to govern solely in the interests of the Republic, and would never allow bias to creep into their judgements. Any who doubt these comments can submit their complaints to the National Reconstruction Council, to be considered once there is enough time available to do so."
 NIK_stalina_empower_the_party_desc:0 "The PSD is currently the largest party in our Republic, and is home to a variety of centrist ideologies. However, the party's current structure does not allow for the various factions within our party to be heard. As such, the PSD must evolve: it shall become the 'Party of Power.' With this restructuring, the PSD will allow for greater discussion between its various actions, with greater ideological variety inside the party than outside the party. The PSD already serves as the main party for those who support democracy and stand against radicalism, so any consensus reached within the PSD will effectively be the same as a consensus reached within the legislature. The majority consensus shall apply to all party members, and that consensus shall be reached through free, democratic discussion.\n\nOf course, more radical ideologues will remain outside the party, so that they can't derail discussions with their extremist propaganda."
 NIK_stalina_public_concessions_desc:0 "The PSD and the Reconstruction Government have been highly focused on destroying extremism's influence within the Republic, but it is important that we do not forget our roots. The PSD serves the people, and our policies must reflect this. As such, President Stalina has decided to dedicate funds to the people, in the forms of welfare and pensions. Welfare services and pensions shall be expanded, and our government shall in general ensure that our citizens are taken care of. No citizen shall starve on our streets, no person shall be left without a home in our cities. No veterans shall be left destitute for sacrificing themselves for their country, and no citizen shall need to turn to radicalism merely to survive."
 NIK_stalina_allow_for_a_split_desc:0 "When in the process of establishing the Reconstruction Government the PSD de-facto absorbed the other parties of the democratic front in, many agreed it was a necessary measure. Now, however, even with our efforts to solidify this union, cracks in the system are starting to show, with activists of the former SMR and DSNP aiming to reestablish those parties once again.\n\nAfter a brief period of discussion, many in the administration seem not to mind this, seeing the division of the political center as a natural phenomenon, and agreeing that the old party structure is not to blame for the situation the republic now finds itself in. With Stalina's approval, the two parties are soon to be restored, though many of the deputies are to stay in the PSD securing its status as the sole ruling party in the Reconstriction Government and ensuring full control of it."
 NIK_stalina_keep_the_big_tent_model_desc:0 "On the very onset of the Reconstruction Government's establishment, some deputies expressed concern over the fate of the Republic's democratic landscape, presenting the idea that the only way to recover from this crisis would be to preserve the center coalition, centralized around the PSD, as a broad force of containment against radicals.\n\nWith the question of the former SMR and DSNP cadre leaving the PSD to refound their parties, this suggestion has been bought up again and rallied around by a large fraction in the government, arguing that if the unity of the center would be jeopardized, the democratic forces would fall divided. With this proposal practically guaranteeing governmental stability, Stalina has decided to veto the split, cementing her administration's nature as a grand union of all three former moderate parties, disempowering any remaining real opposition."
 NIK_stalina_ensure_free_elections_desc:0 "Elections, when they are held, shall be free and fair. We cannot make the same mistakes as the previous government, the right to vote for everyone must be upheld. Fair elections will ensure a stable republic and a working, capable democracy.\n\nTo ensure fair elections are upheld, Stalina has authorized for new institutions that promote democracy and freedom be established. These institutions will make sure everyone gets an equal chance to vote. They will also ensure the government does not try to influence or affect the elections themselves or its results. There will be no more chaos at the polls!"
 NIK_stalina_the_constitution_of_national_reconstruction_desc:0 "Until Russia is reunified, the state of emergency must remain in place. To this end, we will enact a new constitution, one that holds true to the values of national reconstruction and anti-extremism. If that means putting a limit on freedoms and individual rights for now, so be it. Our republic has to be protected from the radicals who wish to destroy it, no matter what!"
 NIK_stalina_faith_in_democracy_desc:0 "The state of emergency must end, the government cannot maintain a republic with no elections. We cannot call ourselves a democracy if we do not even follow basic democratic principles! This means - come the end of Stalina's lawful term, elections will be called, and the republic will choose between a new president and Stalina.\n\nEnding the state of emergency will also give the people of the republic more rights and freedoms. Allowing the people to exercise these rights will be the first big test of our remade democracy under Stalina. Hopefully, we will not relive the past."

 NIK_stalina_freedom_sovereignty_patriotism_desc:0 "Svoboda, Suverenitet, i Patriotizm - the motto of the Sovereign Democratic Party. We are the party of strength. We are the party of sovereignty. We are the party that fights for all of the people. And most of all, we are the party for a strong Russia that works for all of its citizens. The people know our platform, and have given us a broad mandate to carry it out. Let us not disappoint them by going back on our promises."
 NIK_stalina_a_democratic_centre_desc:0 "The PSD stands for many things. For freedom and democracy, sure. But for moderation above all. The people of Russia do not need radical and extreme solutions for their problems. Demagogues have destroyed their country, and they do not wish for another one. They want sensible and reasonable solutions that don't affect their lives any more than necessary. The PSD is at the center of politics, and abhors extremism in all forms. Democracy and moderation is our guiding principle. And we will draw a hard line against anyone who goes against it."
 NIK_stalina_survey_republic_elections_desc:0 "Russia is a land of many peoples and ethnicities. Many minorities have a degree of independence, allowing them to have their own republics and elections. We must ensure they retain their autonomy. And part of that is eliminating any corrupting outside influence in these republics.\n\nSmaller units of organization have had issues with election fraud for a long time. No longer will this be tolerated. We will begin keeping a closer eye on these elections, and how they are carried out. Then we can be assured these peoples are truly picking their own destinies."
 NIK_stalina_centralize_election_administration_desc:0 "Free and fair elections must be ensured throughout our republic. And that means fraud cannot be tolerated. We will establish a non-partisan agency, tasked with rooting out and eliminating election fraud and corruption. Election administration will be placed under federal control, although we will make exceptions for local elections in minority republics. Vote-rigging and other such actions are a threat to the very legitimacy of our democracy. And it will be eliminated."
 NIK_stalina_no_room_for_corruption_desc:0 "Russia has gotten a reputation as a place where an elite political class can live off of the wealth squeezed out of the suffering peasants. So it was in the days of the tsars, when rich aristocrats would live in sumptuous mansions surrounded by the grass and mud huts of the serfs. And so it was in the days of the Soviet Union, when party members would race to their dachas in handbuilt limousines, passing the horse-carriages of the Proletariat. No longer! Corruption will be eliminated in Russia. Massive fines await those who seek to use their positions to profit from the people. And there will be no exceptions or tolerance at all."
 NIK_stalina_the_paramount_civic_duty_desc:0 "Any Republic is only as good as the people it represents. Too often, people of other nations have allowed others to do the deciding for them, rather than face their issues head on. The results have been disastrous every time. We will not let that happen here. Voting is key to our democracy, and so is actually running for positions as well. Local elections and referenda are highly important, no less so than national ones. If the people understand this, and act on it, we will secure our democracy for a long time to come."
 NIK_stalina_the_new_russian_century_desc:0 "Tsushima and the Treaty of Portsmouth. Tannenberg and Brest-Litovsk. Barbarossa and Generalplan Ost. Russia has been the victim of disastrous defeats and destruction at the hands of foreign powers.But we refuse to let that continue. No longer will the 20th century be known as Russia's century of humiliation. Because with the new republic, Russia once again rises to prominence on the world stage! We shall finally be strong once more, and we shall make this new century into a Russian century - a century with Russia claiming its position as a world power."

 NIK_stalina_justice_before_compromise_desc:0 "We won't work across the aisle, and why should we? Who wants to water down our necessary laws and policies, just for the sake of patting ourselves on the back that we worked with a few minority parties? It is unnecessary, as we have the strength to get things done by ourselves, without the consultation of the other parties. Moreover, the people explicitly elected us to do these things, not any other party. They wanted a strictly PSD term, and they got it. And we will not deliver anything less than what we promised."
 NIK_stalina_the_oppositions_finest_desc:0 "Many other opposition parties exist in Russia who will never cooperate with us. Their individual members, however, are another matter. Many opposition members exist who agree with us on at least one issue. Sometimes, more than one. We can try to use that support to help get our bills and reforms passed. Working across the aisles is much easier than just trying to force things through on our own."
 NIK_stalina_roots_for_healthy_competition_desc:0 "Sure, crushing our opposition into the ground with a massive monolithic organization is tempting, but we have more noble goals in mind. Democracy is not one group of people steamrolling the other. It is a group of people of differing perspectives and beliefs coming together to solve their problems. Thus, working with other parties is essential. Merely consolidating our own power at all costs will lead to a single-party state, just like in the Soviet Union."
 NIK_stalina_towards_a_sovereign_future_desc:0 "It is time for the signature policy of the SDP to be unveiled. The National Sovereignty Act will change our diplomatic position forevermore. Strategic resources in Russia, such as oil, will be severely restricted from the international market. But this is not a protectionist act, or one aimed at autarky. These limitations will be lifted for those with defensive ties with our republic. If you want to gain access to our bountiful resources, you must make an alliance with us. And everybody wants these strategic materials."
 NIK_stalina_right_the_pasts_wrongs_desc:0 "Any objective view of Russia's long history will find many shameful acts and practices. The rampant discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. The rampant misogyny towards women. And poor treatment of the disabled. And we say "enough!"\n\nWe shall move forward with a socially egalitarian agenda. Our crusade will end and outlaw these practices, and ensure equal treatment under the law. For aren't we all Russians? And aren't Russians guaranteed rights?"
 NIK_stalina_campaign_against_discrimination_desc:0 "For too long, the pogoms and other acts of discrimination have kept Russia as a backward state from the middle ages. Even worse, horrific acts of religious persecution still occur in Russia at this very moment, in our supposedly enlightened time. This will stop immediately. We will grant legal mechanisms and rules for Jews, Muslims, and other religious minorities to defend and protect themselves. We will combat pervasive religious hatred with the full force of the law."
 NIK_stalina_charter_of_universal_rights_desc:0 "It's not enough to pass a few rules granting citizens legal rights. We must also codify it into our constitution. The great democracies of the world have unassailable provisions that protect their people, and so will we. And thus, we bring forth an Equal Rights Amendment. Modeled after the Bill of Rights in America, we will make being an egalitarian nation that grants everyone equal rights a permanent feature of Russia. And that is going to be hard for any would-be authoritarian to roll back."
 NIK_stalina_decommunization_and_dewarlordization_desc:0 "Symbols may seem just symbols at first, sure. But to many people, who have suffered under the tyrants of Russia, they are extremely hurtful and terrifying reminders of times we wish to move beyond. And that any political party, no matter how small, will gleefully use these symbols to identify themselves with the monsters of the past is disgusting.\n\nProminent symbols of the communist regime and certain warlords will be banned, except for art and historical purposes. These legacies have no place in modern Russia. And if the people that march under them can't find something new, maybe it's a sign their beliefs should be left in the past as well."
 NIK_stalina_a_united_russia_desc:0 "Russia is still geographically torn asunder. By other warlords in the east. And by the Germans in the west. But though we may not be united in a territorial sense, we are united in a much bigger one. For all Russians are united in spirit. And we are a state that shows this unity more than any other. We march united, and committed. For a Russia united by equality. And a Russia united by a strong national identity. That unity and commitment towards this Russia will see us through till the end."
 NIK_stalina_a_shining_precedent_desc:0 "We have done it. People doubted that the PSD would exercise its authority in a peaceful, constructive, and democratic manner. But we have. Our agenda has been enacted entirely within the confines of the law, and with no extraordinary measures taken. And the will of the people has been respected, to boot. This is a glorious victory for democracy, showing that great change can be accomplished within the system. Let us hope this convinces the population that our system is sustainable and strong as well."

 NIK_authdem_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "After over a decade of German terror bombing and the chronic insecurity caused by the raids of rival warlords, economic activity in our corner of Russia is on life support. Now that the government is stable and we have control over our own borders, resuscitating the economy will be a priority for the new government."
 NIK_authdem_development_for_a_modern_russia_desc:0 "Komi exists in a dangerous neighborhood, with the Germans to the west and a motley collection of pretender states to the east. While private enterprise and free competition will continue to be encouraged within the Republic, we don't have the luxury of waiting for economic development from the bottom up. Modernity will come to Russia under the leadership of the PSD and the strong guidance of state-owned enterprises in crucial sectors, complementing its private companies. We have no other choice, even if it means that there will be sacrifices asked of the people and the workers along the way."
 NIK_authdem_prioritize_state_development_desc:0 "Getting the economy off the ground is a herculean task in any developing country, even more so in an economy like Russia's, reeling from years of conflict. The PSD has decided that the state must utilize its coffers and manpower to jumpstart the new economy by establishing state-owned enterprises to develop critical sectors of the economy and to advance key infrastructure projects throughout the Republic. Some would call this inefficient, arguing that the state would run these projects at a loss - we answer that nobody else is willing to lay the foundations of a modern economy, and unless they have a better idea, they can stay out of the way!"
 NIK_authdem_invite_foreign_investment_desc:0 "To say the least, Russia is starved of capital. Its productive capacity has been funneled into interminable warfare, and the turbulent political situation has naturally made potential investors extremely cautious to risk putting their funds in enterprises that could easily go bust. Building wealth inside the country takes time that we simply do not have. Attracting investment from outside, on the other hand, is significantly easier.\n\nThe international business community craves new markets, and Russia with its large population and abundant natural resources has a great, untapped potential for profit. Foreign companies can expect low taxes and many potential customers, but they must remember one thing: Russia is a sovereign nation, and they are only there as guests."
 NIK_authdem_the_resources_of_the_motherland_desc:0 "The territory of Russia is rich in natural resources - oil, minerals, and crops. Too often, however, these resources are used as a means of personal enrichment for the various warlords, without a care for the development of a modern economy. Now that the Republic is exerting control over a growing swath of Russian territory, we should establish a government agency to take stock of the bounties of Russian soil and to ensure that they are directed for the good of the state and its people."
 NIK_authdem_consolidate_the_defense_industry_desc:0 "If the Republic wants to take the fight to the other pretender states in the East - and, eventually, against the Germans in the West - it is essential that we have a defense industry capable of supplying the vast quantities of equipment our new model military will require. This cannot be done through small enterprises and cottage industries: we must think larger, consolidating our various arms manufacturers to unlock the economies of scale necessary for our growing Republic. Through partial nationalization and state-guided mergers, the PSD government will ensure that our soldiers will never want for bullets or quality equipment."
 NIK_authdem_roads_across_russia_desc:0 "A nation without infrastructure is a nation in name only. Bereft of the connections that allow for commerce and travel, the country is divided, the people's concerns solely local. Russia was once far more connected than it is now; years of bombing and warlordism have caused a retreat, as citizens refuse to stray further from their immediate places of residence. Although there have been minor improvements as local governments build for their own purposes, much of the country remains far behind the Soviet era in this regard.\n\nIf Russia is to reemerge onto the world stage, the Republic needs to forcibly tackle this crisis. The revitalization of our road infrastructure will allow commerce to expand and fuel economic growth, as well as incalculably improving the lot of ordinary people through the expansion of work opportunities."
 NIK_authdem_an_economy_for_us_all_desc:0 "As economic improvement takes Russia into the modern age, we must be careful to avoid the concentration of increased material wealth into too few hands. The economy is growing particularly in urban areas, with the potential of leaving rural localities behind, and businesses often invest so much in improving physical capital and managerial salaries that they leave nothing for their citizens. As all of the veterans of Syktyvkar's turbulent political scene know, inequality causes resentment, which can and frequently does lead to political instability.\n\nKeeping wealth from becoming excessively concentrated naturally requires government action. Welfare programs, stringent regulations, and taxation on unscrupulous businesses should keep inequality in check, ensuring that Russia's prosperity is truly enjoyed by all."
 NIK_authdem_aid_for_the_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "Cut off from the outside world by constant turmoil, Russia's farmers have suffered long, difficult years. Between a general lack of feed, modern equipment, infrastructure, and customers, the agricultural sector has been squeezed from all sides. Without a steady influx of food from a strong farming base, building up a country is impossible. It is for this reason that agricultural aid is a necessity for economic improvement.\n\nThrough extensive subsidies, loans, and other forms of financial assistance, the government can revitalize the Russian agricultural sector, and not soon enough; as our growing cities teem with hungry mouths to feed, we need as much food as we can get."
 NIK_authdem_national_recovery_initiatives_desc:0 "The PSD has great plans for the rejuvenation of the Russian nation and people, but none of that will come to fruition without mobilizing the people for the cause. The government will establish sweeping programs for public works, industrialization, and defense construction to enlist the people in the project of rebuilding the Republic. Where private enterprise shies away, the people will step in, and the government will reward them for their labor."
 NIK_authdem_expand_rural_opportunities_desc:0 "A key characteristic of 'modern' society is the productivity of its agricultural sector, with machines doing the work of a hundred field hands in half the time. This is not to say that we disparage the work of the honest farmer; far from it! Most Russian farmers live hand-to-mouth, with antiquated tools and outdated machinery forcing a reliance on manual labor - oftentimes their own children, the future of our nation. We must invest in the means of agricultural production, subsidizing access to new technologies and labor-saving contraptions to improve productivity, ensure farming profitability, and give hope to farmers that they are working towards a brighter future."
 NIK_authdem_stimulate_local_businesses_desc:0 "While our detractors often charge that the PSD cares little for private industry in favor of a state-owned economy, nothing could be further from the truth. We recognize that we are not infallible or all-knowing. Private enterprise will always be more effective at identifying and meeting economic needs at the local level, far removed from the specific needs of the state in defense, infrastructure, and natural resources. We do not seek to control every aspect of economic life in the Republic; indeed, we encourage the people to embrace the spirit of competition, to have a vested interest in their own prosperity. In this regard, all the state should do is create incentives for the Republic's entrepreneurs to invest in the economy, and to provide access to capital for those who seek to start a business of their own."
 NIK_authdem_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "Every section of Russian society has been impacted by the long war, but none more cruelly so than its children. The new generation knows nothing other than poverty, danger, and upheaval. Even such a simple luxury as an education like their parents had is unattainable. The decline in educational levels is a slow-moving crisis that, if it goes unsolved, will cause a serious shortage of skilled workers in the years to come.\n\nBuilding, funding, and improving schools across the Republic is both the ethical and economical solution. It fulfills national development goals while increasing opportunities for millions. Nothing will signify Russia's slow but sure return to normality more than the masses of children filling classrooms for the first time in a generation."
 NIK_authdem_standardize_the_schools_desc:0 "As we embark on our mission to improve education, one sore issue sticks out immediately: curricula and educational standards vary enormously between schools across the Republic, as distance, inequality of resources, and a lack of communication between localities drive them further apart. Schools that do not adequately educate their students are scarcely better than schools at all, and the potential is great for a wide skill gap to develop between various regions of the country.\n\nMany of these problems stem from the lack of a widely penetrating central bureaucracy. The government can do a far better job at setting and enforcing standards than the disparate array of local educational arrangements that exist currently, and it must if the Republic's less advantaged children are to get a better lot in life."
 NIK_authdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc:0 "Rebuilding a country is the tireless endeavour of an enormous number of skilled workers, engineers chief among them. Without them, it would be impossible to erect bridges, lay down vast lengths of road, design military vehicles, or perform any other of the staggering variety of tasks necessary to keep a society running. However, engineers are of short supply in Russia, owing to a general diminishment in educational capacity, and there are far too few to satisfy the exponentially growing demand.\n\nIncreasing attendance in engineering programs is not just a matter of economics: it is a matter of national security. Through subsidies to private schools and the establishment of new public technical schools, the government can encourage the formation of a new generation of bright young engineers who will take their country to tremendous heights."

 NIK_kosygin_springtime_in_russia_desc:0 "The people of the Republic have spoken; SMR, standing for liberty, economic freedom and a government of common sense, has been elected. Our mandate has been given to us freely and fairly through majority, rather than through the shady politicking of the old Komi Republic.\n\nThe newly-inaugurated President Kosygin has announced his intention to move ahead at once. Now that we no longer have to worry about the threat of paramilitaries, the business of governance can be carried out as it would be in any modern democracy. The long winter of discontent has ended, and freedom blooms anew from the soil of the Motherland."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_democracy_desc:0 "The cornerstone of democratic success is majority rule. Though both reactionaries and far-left vanguardists deride this idea as 'mob rule', there is no more clear a survey of the people's desires than a free and open election. If a majority freely supports us, then the radicals have no grounds for their claims of 'elitism' so often lobbed at liberal democrats.\n\nThat the majority of voters reside in urban areas, the core support bases for liberal ideals, is irrelevant. Our popularity is perfectly natural, and we need no dirty tricks to explain our success. The notion that the votes of our support base are inherently of low value due to their sheer numbers is mere jealousy on the part of labor and conservative politicians."
 NIK_kosygin_freedom_and_fairness_desc:0 "Though we always tried our best, the Komi Republic was never able to do right by its minorities. Even the eponymous Komi were often systematically denied a voice by racist elements of the Assembly. Now that western Russia is under our banner, we have entire republics of non-Russians!\n\nWe are happy to have our brother peoples living and working alongside us, but their republics are much younger and more fragile than ours. Unsavory types, such as Voznesensky, have a vested interest in suppressing their voters, and that's to say nothing of what radicals might get up to. President Kosygin has thus pledged to help build democratic institutions and carry out surveys of the minority republics, so that the interests of all citizens are fairly represented."
 NIK_kosygin_survey_republic_elections_desc:0 "When even a single voter is denied their fundamental rights, democracy suffers. It might not seem so at the time, but every step away from guaranteed universal suffrage is a step towards totalitarianism. For a proper democracy, this will not do.\n\nEveryone, from the most hard-done-by farmer to the wealthiest urbanite, is of equal value in the democratic process. Neither the elitism of the far-right nor the rabid classism of the far-left will benefit our republic. One citizen, one vote. With anything less, could we truly call ourselves a democracy?"
 NIK_kosygin_learn_from_past_mistakes_desc:0 "In truth, the Russia that we have begun to build here in the west is not the same nation extinguished by the Germans two decades ago. Nor is it the Provisional Republic, or the Empire. Our republic is something different; an entirely new nation, born amidst the graves of its parents.\n\nAppropriately, our vision for Russia must be forward-thinking and idealistic. Past Russian states had their virtues, but all ultimately failed for a single reason: they refused to change. There was always some rigid ideological line to toe, some utopian obligation that could never be fulfilled. Our republic will not make the same mistakes. We are trying something new, focusing on the practical needs of the present rather than a future that exists only in the dreams of ideologues, or a past that led Russia to destruction several times over."
 NIK_kosygin_towards_a_shining_future_desc:0 "It's never easy to move on. Russia has much to be proud of in its past, but there is just as much about our history that is sordid and shameful. There was always someone waiting in the wings to lead us astray, away from the path that would have best served the people. Russia has been disappointed by its leaders, time and time again. They always wanted the same thing: a Russia that was the overlord of Eurasia, tolerated no dissent and was feared by all the world.\n\nIt never worked. Fear always gave way to hate, dissent could never be silenced, and our neighbours never had cause to trust us. It's time to put away the dark dreams of Russia-that-was; time to embrace the future of freedom and peace that was denied her for so, so long."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_unity_desc:0 "The foundation of a successful democracy is cooperation. While it might be nice to imagine everyone sharing our ideals, that isn't how people work. The diversity of race, creed and class is mirrored in the diversity of thought within the minds of our citizens. The myopic approach of the Bolsheviks, assuming that everyone can be swayed to their 'perfect' ideology, must be dispensed with for the Republic to remain strong and free.\n\nTo demonstrate our good intentions, we shall enter into an alliance with one of the other major parties in the Assembly. Both command substantial support from the populace, and their support would strengthen our mandate. The question is: which? Which party will best suit our purposes: the rural, social-democratic PSD, or the labor-based democratic socialists of the DSNP?"
 NIK_kosygin_the_violet_platform_desc:0 "Despite being marred by Voznesensky's legacy, the DSNP still commands the respect and support of urban working-class voters. Though more directly inclined towards socialism than ourselves, they are just as committed as we are to democracy. Working with them will show the urban working class that we are still dedicated to advancing the interests of the proletariat, even if our take on socialism isn't quite what they might like.\n\nInformally dubbed the 'Violet Platform', our alliance will be based on a promise to more actively pursue socialism. The more rightist elements of SMR will not be pleased, but they'll come around eventually. We are still ultimately socialists, after all; it makes sense for us to join with the party that shares our end goals, even if our means differ."
 NIK_kosygin_for_the_worker_desc:0 "Hardline, anti-democratic socialists never understood what the working class really needed. All that talk of theory and uncompromising ideology... what good did it ever do the men and women who make a living on factory floors? A worker can't feed their family with populist ideals and workplace lectures!\n\nBoth SMR and the DSNP understand what the workers really want: a safe, productive work environment, one without harsh conditions or threats to life and limb. Better pay, better hours and better safety regulations will lead to healthier and more efficient workplaces. We will show the workers that one doesn't need to be a rabble-rousing demagogue to have their best interests at heart."
 NIK_kosygin_the_sovereign_coalition_desc:0 "The PSD has little in common with SMR; while they are ardently social-democratic, we remain committed to socialism. They find support amongst the rural populace and conservatives, while we appeal to urbane and progressive voters. Nevertheless, they are more trustworthy than the perpetually corrupt DSNP, and desire a strong Russia as much as we do.\n\nWe can work with these 'sovereignists'. Their policies of patriotism and Russian self-sufficiency might need to be tempered by cooler heads, but those aren't insurmountable obstacles. Some of their ideas have much to recommend about them; we will need a strong military to face Germany, and a certain measure of economic independence would protect us from negative economic developments around the world."
 NIK_kosygin_for_the_people_desc:0 "Understandably, SMR is generally leery of the military. It has often served as fertile ground for radicalism of both left- and right-wing varieties. Involving armed men in politics never ends well. That said, the PSD is correct in its assessment that Russia needs a stronger military to defend itself.\n\nIn the spirit of cooperation, we will show that we are willing to set aside our prejudices and experiment with the ideas of fellow democrats. Progressivism and pragmatism are not inherently in conflict with one another, and our technocratic ideas might find some appeal amongst high command. With the PSD's backing, we will begin a review into how we can improve the technological capabilities of the military and maintain its professional standards."
 NIK_kosygin_a_show_of_cooperation_desc:0 "Even if it's not a formal coalition government, we have shown our commitment to democracy by cooperating with another political party. Some of our hardliners are yet to stop sulking and publicly give their blessing to this endeavour, but that doesn't matter. This exercise in goodwill has been a resounding success - none can question that fact.\n\nSome critics have derided both parties involved, dismissing the joint effort as a token gesture. They don't understand that democracy is more complicated than they make it out to be. There are always negotiations to undertake, compromises to be made. Yes, the fascists and communists might not have to worry about petty disagreements - but our freedom and happiness is more than worth that trifling cost."
 NIK_kosygin_a_platform_for_reform_desc:0 "'Russia' and 'reform' are, sadly, two words that have never gone well together. Historically, reform has been hated both for going too far and for not going far enough. Foreigners have often observed that most Russians would rather indulge in murder than allow peaceful reform to occur under any circumstances.\n\nWe must agree somewhat. Reform is all about compromise and gradual change; it offends both ends of the political spectrum and provides a ready target for rabble-rousers. Nevertheless, we must press forth in line with our principles. The people have shown their maturity and commitment to reform by electing SMR - we must not disappoint them. Cultural and social reform are both on the table and ready to be presented to the Assembly."
 NIK_kosygin_assist_the_republics_desc:0 "Neither the Empire nor the Bolsheviks ever showed much interest in improving the nation as a whole. For them, Russia only needed investment in a few key areas, usually whatever was relevant to the latest propagandized attempt to play catch-up with the West. The notion of wide-reaching progress was entirely lost on them.\n\nTo correct our course and become a truly modern state, we must take a more holistic approach to national wellbeing. We are not a top-down state ruling by decree, but a union of free and equal republics. None of our constituent republics, no matter their history or demographics, deserve to be left behind. So, the programs of modernization and urbanization employed in our heartlands will be shared with all our brother republics. The entire Russian family will be united in prosperity!"
 NIK_kosygin_cultural_exhibits_desc:0 "Russia is home to more than just Russians. Dozens of ethno-cultural groups make up our great nation, though the Russian supremacist attitudes of past governments have diminished that fact in the world's eyes. Even many Russian Slavs, steeped in their own culture, refuse to accept the diversity of our nation.\n\nTo protect the heritage of our many peoples, President Kosygin has proposed the establishment of the All-Russian Heritage Committee. Comprised of representatives from each republic, the ARHC will direct funding for museums, festivals, artwork commissions and so forth. When the world thinks 'Russian culture', they should think of more than just icons and domed churches."
 NIK_kosygin_protect_natural_beauty_desc:0 "The Motherland has not been treated well by her children. The Tsars might have been incompetent in economic matters, but at least they were incapable of ruining the countryside. The Bolsheviks, obsessed with rapid industrialization and maximizing economic output, were a different story. The failures of Bukharin's initiatives litter the Russian landscape; open-faced mines carved into hillsides, forests of smokestacks spewing soot skyward, rivers clogged with industrial runoff...\n\nIt's a sad sight, and one that no progressive nation should tolerate. If such practices continue, how long will it be until all of Russia looks like Kaukasien? Proper protections should be established before we progress any further with our industrialization and urbanization programs. Though industrialists and state industries alike will balk at stifling of their expansion, it is a measure necessary for future generations to enjoy Russia as it should be."
 NIK_kosygin_uplift_minority_rights_desc:0 "Russia's national character is unfortunately tainted by its tendency towards chauvinism and homogeneity. Minorities of all stripes have been mistreated for centuries; first by royalty, then by revolutionaries. It seems that without intervention, Russia is doomed to remain stuck in its backwards, hateful ways.\n\nWe can't get rid of racism overnight, but we can make some important first steps. First, and most importantly: racial discrimination and hate speech must be outlawed, so that everyone can live lives free of fear. Second: the autonomy of minority republics must be permanently enshrined in the constitution. That is the only way to guarantee that a chauvinist government will never again trample on the rights of minorities."
 NIK_kosygin_the_march_of_progress_desc:0 "Progress has never been a popular idea in Russia. It has always been affiliated with the things that many people dislike: change, diversity, foreign influence. People fear what they don't understand - and the Russian people are particularly short on understanding.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way. People can learn, change their ways, open their minds; but it cannot be forced upon them. That is what traditional socialists always failed to understand. Some measure of top-down change is necessary, but the transformation of society they sought could never be forced upon an unwilling populace. Perhaps it will take a century to achieve our ideal. Maybe more. But no matter what comes, no matter what future generations choose, we have done the right thing, and given hope to a generation born with none of it."
 
 NIK_socdem_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "The current economy is in a terribly bad shape. Much of what we once had was ravaged by German bombings twenty years ago, and the rest was destroyed by the Russian warlords before us. We will have to start a long recovery process if we are ever going to reestablish Russia as a dominant Socialist nation. Thankfully, our economic advisers are already formulating a plan to get us back on track."
 NIK_socdem_public_sector_investments_desc:0 "The public sector of any economy includes infrastructure, law enforcement, healthcare, public education, and other important services. Through this sector, we handle the essential services that every citizen in the Komi Republic may use (provided they pay taxes). Arguably, the public sector benefits everyone, and it is why we should put an emphasis on this part of the economy."
 NIK_socdem_lessons_from_the_reds_desc:0 "Several of our economic advisers believe that Lenin was once going in the right direction when he issued the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy in the 1920s. The Bukharinists shared the same ideas regarding a private sector-based development that would feed into a strong state-driven economy. Today, in the Komi Republic, we have decided to try the "capitalist turning into socialist" economic strategy and see how well it works. It could be that the Reds were correct in which policies work best for Russia."
 NIK_socdem_our_own_gosplan_desc:0 "When the Russian worker state was first established in 1921, the Soviets developed a Gosplan to handle the central economic planning of the young nation. The agency would maintain the Soviet economy until the Union's collapse in the face of Nazi Germany. We must develop our own Gosplan-esque agency to grow the young Republican economy. It must have the authority to coordinate both the state industrial development and our public works projects."
 NIK_socdem_rights_for_the_worker_desc:0 "We have seen throughout history the oppression that everyday workers faced. From Ancient Egypt to the Middle Ages-style serfdom to the grueling Industrial Revolution, common workers were just tools that were exploited by the middle and high classes. The Komi Republic has no need for this type of ruthless exploitation; workers' rights were an essential part of the NSDP's campaign, and they will remain our highest priority. When we develop and enforce our policies, we put the workers above everyone else, as they are the collective Atlas that holds this Earth in place."
 NIK_socdem_the_national_resource_directorate_desc:0 "Here in Komi we have an abundance of different natural resources, but we cannot afford to use up all of them carelessly. We must develop an agency, the National Resource Directorate, to keep track of our natural resource supply and monitor its use. We can ensure that the resources will only be used to enrich the state and if they cannot be used, they will be carefully preserved."
 NIK_socdem_expand_the_key_facilities_desc:0 "Our large industrial facilities are precious to us; they often provide all of the manufacturing necessary to keep our economy running and our citizens working. We must work on expanding the large facilities we currently have, especially the industry in Izhevsk and Gorky. With improved factories and more jobs for our workers, our economy will certainly be strengthened."
 NIK_socdem_the_public_works_boom_desc:0 "Our careful policies have transformed a weakened economy into a quickly-developing one, with a strong base for additional improvement. It is safe to say that our economy is now one of Russia's finest, and it is all thanks to our public spending and infrastructure building. We must remember to thank our patriotic workers who have allowed us to establish this great socialist society, and it is through their craft that we are able to live prosperous lives in the Komi Republic."
 NIK_socdem_private_sector_supplements_desc:0 "Our plan for a total economic recovery starts with developing a private sector so that our people can actively run businesses and generate a profit. Right now, we need an economic system that can work for the individual citizens of our country. If the private sector plan succeeds, we will have a stronger economic base that can transition smoothly into the socialist state we desire. The development towards socialism begins with a capitalist base, after all."
 NIK_socdem_open_to_enterprise_desc:0 "One method we can use to spark our economy is inviting foreign enterprises into our country and permitting them to build factories. These factories will generate a profit for us and a profit for our network of partner companies. All we have to do is reach out to some of these large businesses and convince them to bring their manufacturing plants to Russia."
 NIK_socdem_stimulate_local_economies_desc:0 "This economic plan requires the people to be the main source of income for the country. We can give jobs to our citizens by creating local building projects across the Republic, boosting the smaller economies. Once we raise the national standard of living and disperse wealth throughout, our socialist system will be able to manifest under our guiding hand."
 NIK_socdem_regulations_against_exploitation_desc:0 "When the general public is given power, it is our responsibility to ensure everyone is safe. Ever since we created the private sector, many privately-owned businesses have spawned, each with their own unique treatment of workers. More often than not, these businesses abuse the workers for their own corrupt personal gain, and it is time we put a stop to this cruelty. We must create nationwide safety regulations to ensure our workers are not exploited, and any private business that fails to adopt these regulations will be punished severely."
 NIK_socdem_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations. Yes, Russia has traditionally been a land of uneducated peasants and workers, but it doesn't have to be so!\n\nEstablishing new schools all across the nation must be a top priority. Every year that goes by without a proper education system is another generation denied the future they deserve. If Russia is to have diplomats, scientists, engineers and artists, the basic prerequisites for their existence must first be met!"
 NIK_socdem_standardize_the_schools_desc:0 "The question of curriculum has always been too political. Every scheming dictator and obsessive ideologue wants children to learn nothing more than what they deem 'appropriate'. This has been the downfall of every education system that caters to the masses, and it will not be repeated here.\n\nThe fledgling Department of Education has begun to draw up a standard curriculum under the President's oversight. The emphasis will be on the things most important for a modern nation: science and mathematics. All other fields will be under the jurisdiction of the autonomous Republics and regional governments. This will demonstrate our trust in subordinate governments and allow for the safe continuation of minority cultures."
 NIK_socdem_a_generation_of_engineers_desc:0 "Russia has been destroyed by countless years of war and bombings. To rebuild it, we will need more engineers than ever before. Civil Engineers from all across the nation must be called to serve in new, large projects of building bridges, railways, and roads. Cities must be improved to support the health of the people and ensure services are met.\n\nUnfortunantly, the current amount of engineers just won't cut it. If we want more engineers, we must teach more engineers. Universities will be persuaded to hold even more classes in Civil Engineering as well as helping bring additional people into the field. Soon, Russian cities will look even better than they did before all the bombings! "

 NIK_kosygin_the_russian_economy_desc:0 "There is nothing much to recommend about the Russian economy, such as it is. We have plenty of natural resources and a large population, but lack the means to take advantage of them. What little industry we inherited from the Soviets is variously outdated, run-down or just plain broken. That's to say nothing of our complete lack of international trade, a staple of modern economics.\n\nThankfully, President Kosygin is an old hand at this sort of thing and knows just the people to help draft a plan for the new economy. It won't be easy; even the fundamentals of our economy are lacking and many crucial sectors are non-existent. We're starting from nothing - but perhaps that will be for the best. Better to be free of old burdens entirely than bear their expenses."
 NIK_kosygin_establish_the_economic_zones_desc:0 "The finer details of economic recovery are for aspiring entrepreneurs and workers to manage. Free enterprise will take care of the groundwork. The state's role, meanwhile, must be to direct development in the most efficient direction possible.\n\nTo that end, our territory will be divided up into economic zones: regions where the economy will be organized by the government along the necessary lines. This way, we can avoid situations where prime agricultural land is given over to industry, or areas rich in resources are allocated to farmers."
 NIK_kosygin_the_contract_responsiblity_system_desc:0 "Every past Russian government has attempted to achieve agricultural efficiency, but none ever met with success. The feudal nature of the Empire meant that any proposed reform would have to wrangle the indolent, greedy landowners. The Bolsheviks, on the other hand, cared more about having an ideologically acceptable system than a fair or functioning one. This has made famine a recurring and severe threat to our people.\n\nThe 'Contract Responsibility System' will ensure a stable food supply and good income for rural populations by giving parcels of land to groups of farmers. This will minimize competition over land. Additionally, we will accept taxation in grain and subsidize their other crops."
 NIK_kosygin_aid_for_the_farmers_desc:0 "The current generation of Russian farmers have been building up their livelihoods from nothing. Mechanization was never a priority for the Bolsheviks, and the short-lived war economy only made their situation worse. Most farmers still work the land in the same manner as countless generations of peasants did.\n\nTo feed a growing population, our agricultural capacity needs to catch up with the modern world. For that to happen, every farmer will need the tools and equipment to match his American or Japanese counterpart. Though some economics chafe at the thought, we will have to instate massive discounts to make this possible - not an easy solution, but a smart one in the long-term."
 NIK_kosygin_open_the_republic_desc:0 "Russia is a land of bounty, but it doesn't have everything we need. More specifically: it doesn't have capital. Most of what little wealth exists is in the hands of governments, bar a few particularly miserly individuals. With our nation in the state it's in now, there is only one place for us to turn.\n\nForeign capital must flow into the country. With it will come knowledge, innovation and technology. All three will improve our economy with alacrity, given the disparity in development. It will be a long time before we can break through the glass ceiling and into the upper echelon of global economic powers, but catching up will suffice for now."
 NIK_kosygin_the_developmental_industry_sector_desc:0 "Naturally, industrialization will be a priority for us. The great nations of the world moved on from agrarianism decades if not centuries ago. Attempts were made by past governments, but the scale of industry found in Germany or Britain was never replicated here.\n\nBy offering to establish production facilities catering to foreign markets, we can become a workshop of the world. Given the less developed state of Russia, goods can be produced here at low cost compared to, for example, the United States. Basic goods from Russia exported en masse might not be glamorous, but if it works, it works."
 NIK_kosygin_exploit_southern_oil_reserves_desc:0 "Oil is the lifeblood of nations and the foundation of many economies. Our reserves might not be as vast as those of Venezuela or the Arab nations, but we have plenty to fuel our own economic growth. We have enough, in fact, that exports are a viable option. No doubt some nations will be grateful to have a source that isn't in the pocket of an existing superpower.\n\nReserves already exist in Samara, the Urals and Tatarstan - a decent start, but we will need to drill deeper to find enough for a prospering oil industry. Expansion of existing facilities is a given; we can also look into more opportunities as we expand into Siberia. Just beyond our borders, there could be enough oil to make us a top competitor in the energy business!"
 NIK_kosygin_comprehensive_refinement_program_desc:0 "Exporting crude oil is good business, but it could be better. Because it's refined overseas, we're missing out on a large portion of the profits from the finished product. It would be a lot more profitable to refine our oil here in Russia before exporting a usable product. We might sell a little less, but the overall profits will be much higher.\n\nWith those increased profits, we can follow the lead of the Arabs and begin massive investment programs to bring our nation into the modern era. It's a seller's market, and we're selling at very affordable prices. Black gold will succeed where real gold cannot, and with it we will buy our way to the future."
 NIK_kosygin_foreign_investment_incentives_desc:0 "Some ardently patriotic types argue against it, but one cannot deny the efficacy of foreign investment. Granted, it tends to be the government rather than the citizens who benefit financially - but does that really matter right now? We should take any opportunity to further our economic growth, no matter whether it offends the ideologues and a few proud politicians.\n\nLabor incentives and tax breaks are all one usually needs to get foreign investors interested. We will offer both to corporations who open branch offices in Western Russia, as well as those who partner with Russian companies. It worked for the rest of the world; it can work for us, too!"
 NIK_kosygin_project_kibersin_desc:0 "The field of computing has expanded dramatically in the past two decades. Our resident computer scientists were stunned to learn what kind of advances have been made by the great powers. There has even been some discussion of the possibility that computers will be used in virtually every profession in a few decades!\n\nPresident Kosygin is most interested, and has gathered the Republic's small clique of computer scientists in the capital. Together, they have devised Project Kibersin: an astoundingly ambitious yet quite achievable plan to revolutionize the economy. This will involve establishing computer hubs, placed in key locations around the country. Able to process information at lightning speed, they will provide us with the most centralized and efficiently-managed economy in the world - at least, once we have the technology..."
 NIK_kosygin_managerial_socialism_desc:0 "Our free-market reforms and move away from the Bolsheviks should not be misinterpreted. The President is still, in his heart, a socialist. However, while we might aspire to socialist ideals, we are not blinded by ambition or ideological fanaticism. Socialism cannot be forced; it must be born naturally, coaxed gently into being with the consent of voters.\n\nTo this end, we have adopted the principle of 'Managerial Socialism'. Our economy will be regulated and structured in a manner that avoids the pitfalls of liberal capitalism while still enjoying its benefits. Eventually - so the thinking goes - it will progress into a state wherein a peaceful transition to true socialism will occur naturally, without the need for bloodshed and tyranny."
 NIK_kosygin_for_our_prosperity_desc:0 "Poverty is the bane of all nations. As the wealth and wellbeing of the people diminishes, so too does their homeland. Russia could build cities of gleaming spires, establish a space program and become the world's largest nuclear power. Yet, none of those things would elevate the poor from the gutter and give them the happiness they deserve.\n\nWe shall attack poverty directly and decisively, the better to end its tyranny. This is not a battle that can be won overnight, but future victory can be secured right now. What keeps people in poverty is the need to live on a knife's edge; that can be allayed with a proper safety net. When the poor no longer need to worry about affording their next meal or keeping a roof over their heads, they can become productive citizens and help lift themselves out of deprivation and despair."
 NIK_kosygin_an_educated_populace_desc:0 "When a child is given a worldly, well-rounded education, their potential increases exponentially - so it is with nations.

 NIK_kosygin_unity_in_science_desc:0 "Science is the way to the future, but our progress in that direction has been halted. The rest of the world has moved on, while we, the Russians, are still working with textbooks from the early Soviet era. This problem is easily remedied, but how to get ordinary people invested in this 'boring' subject?\n\nWhy, propaganda! Propaganda is a dirty word these days, but how else can a government effectively convey its ideals and intentions? It doesn't have to mean brainwashing and 24-hour broadcasts; we can campaign for science through TV, radio and newspapers as we would if we were recruiting for the military. The lessons learned from stoking patriotic pride can be applied well in the popularization of science."
 NIK_kosygin_a_bright_generation_desc:0 "President Kosygin is said by some to desire nothing more or less than to be at the head of a grand bureaucratic machine. They say that he cares only for the sense of satisfaction he feels at knowing his grand design is functioning smoothly. They are wrong.\n\nThe greatest and noblest of the President's desires is to leave Russia in a better state than he found it. The best way to ensure that happens is to give all of Russia's children the twin gifts of education and safety. In time, it will fall to them to continue what we have started. Russia's future lives and dies in the hearts of these future workers and intellectuals - in the generation that will shine brightest of all."

 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_army_desc:0 "Our brave men in the field have accomplished a lot for us, yes, but we need to start bringing the Russian Republican Army to contemporary standards. The Germans, Japanese, and Americans all have top-notch militaries, and it is likely due to advanced tactics and modern weapons, neither of which we currently have. In order to restore Russian prestige, we must work to modernize the army and join the ranks of the global superpowers in terms of military might."
 NIK_democratic_lessons_from_the_last_war_desc:0 "Our most recent conflict, the West Russian War, was full of genius tactics and offensives issued by commanders on both sides. We must look back on what worked for us in that war, how we carried out combat and used logistics to conquer our enemy. We can't neglect our opponent's strategy to win the war either, as his forces often fought to the very end. We must adapt these tactics to our current military in order to grow stronger."
 NIK_democratic_study_foreign_strategy_desc:0 "To improve our military strategy, we need to look to the top armies of the world: Germany, Japan, and the United States. We must observe the swift German blitzkrieg across Europe, Japan's burning advance into China, America's brave defense of Scotland. Even the South African War had plenty of cunning tactics from both the United States and the German Reich, and they were carried out with the newest weapons available. Sometimes, foreign military strategies are the most useful."
 NIK_democratic_lessons_from_the_unification_wars_desc:0 "It was not long ago when Russia was still fractured into various warlord states, each with their own dreams and aspirations of unifying the Motherland. In some regions, chaos remains widespread; it was only through our military that we became the strong force we are today. There are many lessons that can be learned from the Unification Wars, including the tactics used to defeat insurgents and the military strategies behind the most successful warlords here in Russia."
 NIK_democratic_tactical_flexibility_desc:0 "Sometimes, our grand battle plans may be disrupted by unexpected, uncontrolled events; we cannot expect every war to be carried out perfectly. Instead of relying on one large battle plan, we should start focusing more on officer initiative: letting the individual commanders make the call based on the unique conditions around them. Because our overall command structures may break down, we might need to delegate the decision-making to the individual units on the ground. We must let each respective unit use the tactics that are best suited for their respective situation to win us the war."
 NIK_democratic_a_modernized_force_desc:0 "Though our Russian Republican Army is mighty within Russia, it does not compare to the contemporary forces of the three global superpowers. Many of our tactics and weapons are from the German-Soviet War over twenty years ago; it is time to bring the RRA to the modern age. We will renovate the army by increasing the military budget, investing in new military technologies, and exploring the most recent military tactics. In the end, the Russian Republican Army will become a Cold War-ready force to be reckoned with."
 NIK_democratic_the_ministry_of_defense_desc:0 "In the process of upgrading our military, it is imperative that we expand our General Staff to meet the new army standards. We will have to provide our generals with updated data from battlefields around the world and keep them informed about the latest military training methods. We must also streamline the Ministry of Defense bureaucracy in order to improve the effectiveness of our leading commanders."
 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_navy_desc:0 "Many years have passed since Russia had a navy she could be proud of. Over twenty years ago, the Kriegsmarine ravaged the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea during the Second World War. The time has come for us to establish a naval force like no other, one that will prove capable of destroying enemies at sea long before they reach land. We will start by expanding our shipyards, recruiting the best available sailors in Russia, and constructing the most up-to-date vessels."
 NIK_democratic_the_russian_republican_air_force_desc:0 "One of the most valuable lessons the world learned from the devastating Second World War was the importance of air superiority and close air support of ground troops. Unfortunately, the Soviet Air Force could not compete with the Luftwaffe twenty years ago; Soviet planes were often out-of-date, and pilots did not have sufficient training. We shall create a proper air force for Komi by building more air bases, recruiting top-of-the-line pilots, researching the latest models for fighters and bombers, and constructing powerful airplanes to wrest control of the skies and rain death on enemy cities."
 NIK_democratic_infantry_equipment_trials_desc:0 "Our soldiers require high-quality guns for use in the field, and unfortunately, all we have are World War II-era rifles and whatever left over from Zlatoust's merchants. We must hold trials and competitions to develop a new standard infantry rifle that can be mass-produced for our men. Better guns means more of the enemy we can kill to win the war."
 NIK_democratic_improve_on_the_armored_corps_desc:0 "The only available tanks we have are from the Second World War, and they do not compete with the armored forces of Germany, Japan, and the United States. If we are to make a swift advance and blast our enemies to pieces, we need to improve the quality of our tanks significantly. We will hold trials to see who can produce the most effective armored tanks that we can use for the army. Hopefully, the end result will be a tank that can compete with that of our opponents."
 NIK_democratic_reopen_the_vyatka_general_staff_academy_desc:0 "The Tsarists of Russia once had a famous academy that was used to train new officers for the General Staff, and it is time that we revive the academy. It will be used to pump out the best-of-the-best generals for our army and improve the officer corps. With effort, it could become one of the top military academies in all of Russia."
 NIK_democratic_strategic_supremacy_desc:0 "When it comes to war, weapons are only as good as the person handling them. Offensive and defensive tactics are only as effective as the commander issuing them. We must strive for the greatest tacticians in all of Russia and defeat our enemies through superior tactics alone. At the end of the day, it is our military maneuvers that will set us above our fiercest opponents."
 
 NIK_democratic_onto_the_world_stage_desc:0 "Now that we have become a regional power, it is time that we start reaching out to nations beyond Russia. To achieve this, we need to establish a proper foreign ministry and hire diplomats that can fully express our intentions to the world. Since we have become a contender for unifying Russia, the world has taken notice of our Republic, and we need to make our first appearance on the world stage."
 NIK_democratic_open_the_gates_desc:0 "Back when we were a smaller power, much of our trade was confined to Russia only. As a current regional power, we need to start branching out to other nations beyond the Motherland, especially the democratic countries around the world. Now that we have some coastal territory in northern Russia, it would be beneficial for us to establish a merchant marine operating around the White Sea, protected by a few of our ships."
 NIK_democratic_the_last_democracies_of_europe_desc:0 "With the rapid expansion of ideologies like Fascism and Socialism, it has become increasingly important for democratic nations to band together during this time of crisis. Essentially, we need to reach out for any European democratic hand we can hold onto, and we must appeal for diplomatic relations with these rare countries. Together, we will form a continental bulwark against the evil threat of Authoritarian regimes."
 NIK_democratic_appeal_for_recognition_desc:0 "Even though we are a regional power in Russia, some countries still see us as "just another warlord state". Diplomatic recognition is the first big step in becoming a relevant world power, the defender of democracy we aspire to be. We must call upon nations like the USA, Iberia, England, and Italy, and convince them that we are a legitimate state and deserve diplomatic recognition."
 NIK_democratic_embassy_funding_desc:0 "Now that we have received diplomatic recognition from some major world powers, we need to establish official embassies in each country that recognizes us as a legitimate state. We will have to set aside part of our budget to maintain these embassies, but we will also enjoy full diplomatic relations with several leading nations. It is a small price to pay for a spot on the world stage."
 NIK_democratic_call_for_investment_desc:0 "Our treasury can only pay for so many of the projects we started to transform this country, and now is the time we look to foreign investment. Thankfully, we can negotiate a deal with the new countries that have recognized us. We can assure these countries that if they decide to invest in our Republic, our debts will be paid back tenfold, and every country involved will benefit."
 NIK_democratic_across_the_ocean_desc:0 "We already enjoy diplomacy with several European nations, but we must also look beyond our home continent for potential allies. Though North America is a distant continent, it serves as a pedestal for the last shining beacon of democracy left on Earth. We should seek to establish connections with Mexico, Canada, and the United States in order to gain more international recognition and more embassies on the Western side of the Atlantic."
 NIK_democratic_a_visit_to_washington_desc:0 "Ever since our democracy was first formed in the ashes of the Soviet Union, one of our biggest diplomatic goals was to someday meet the President of the United States and discuss the global defense of liberty. [NIK.GetLeader], our own President of the Republic, would like to establish a meeting with U.S. President [USA.GetLeader] in Washington. We will take any opportunity to meet the wonderful American people, and if the proposed summit goes well, it will be another diplomatic achievement we can cross off."
 NIK_democratic_apply_for_ofn_observer_desc:0 "Though our current diplomatic status with the OFN is quite limited, we could use some foreign aid to continue building up our country. Our democratic government located in the middle of ravaged Russia should be enough to convince the OFN officials to grant us status as a prospective partner nation. It may be the first step on the road to becoming a proper defender of democracy like our American brethren."

 NIK_burgsys_grand_regency_desc:0 "We, the rightful regency of Holy Russia, have finally risen. Our enemies crowd around us, but we tread the blessed path. The imperial heartlands have been reclaimed in the name of God, Tsar and Nation. The Empire yet rises, as Lazarus, from its tomb.\n\nYet, there remains so much more to do. The foundations of our home are riven by rot, promulgated by the unholy degeneracy of Bolshevism, Jewry and cosmopolitanism. The cleansing fire of our divinely-mandated rule must burn away these impurities and make way for His Imperial Majesty before all hope is lost."
 NIK_burgsys_uplift_the_system_desc:0 "A blessing has come to this world, cloaked in the black guise of National Socialism. This system, based on absolute and unquestioned dictatorial authority, has been best exemplified in the German outpost known to them as 'Kaukasien'. Of course, those lands are rightfully Russian, but the German ruler, Reichskommissar Josias, has forged them into something truly remarkable: a state where subhumans are systematically oppressed and exterminated for the benefit of their racial superiors.\n\nWhat an ingenious creation! Surely, God himself acts through this Josias, showing us the path to reclaiming Russia's glory. Through the proper application of this 'Burgundian System', altered to suit our needs, the rule of the Regent and the Tsarevich will be unassailable. At the same time, it will allow us to cleanse Russia of impure races, forever securing it for the true master race!"
 NIK_burgsys_reform_the_okhrana_desc:0 "We are locked in an eternal struggle with forces too terrible for godly men to truly comprehend. The world sinks deeper and deeper into the muck of degeneracy with each passing day. Only the actions of a brave few men - such as the Regent - keep it from being swallowed up by the darkness.\n\nBut the Regent cannot bear the burden alone. He needs good, reliable servants - trustworthy men pure of heart and intent. As Providence has shown us through the Burgundian System, only a legion of such men, backed with the iron will of the Regent, are capable of maintaining order. The Okhrana, risen from the dead, shall be Russia's shadow-clad bulwark against all evil."
 NIK_burgsys_imperskiye_shturmoviki_desc:0 "The sinful people of Russia have been afflicted such by decades of Judeo-Bolshevik rule that they no longer understand what is best for them. The Regent's laws are but suggestions to the misguided; the only language most of them are able to comprehend is force.\n\nTo carry out the solemn duty of impressing the Regent's divine mandate upon the people, a new army must be raised. This will be no motley band of soldiers, polluted by sin and earthly desires, but an order of the brave, the strong and the pure. They shall be the Regent's strong right arm, dispensing justice with bullet and bayonet to the traitors and undesirables within our realm."
 NIK_burgsys_eyes_in_every_house_desc:0 "Tragically, few Russians understand the importance or even the nature of the Regent's holy work. Unwittingly inspired by the Jewish enemy, they shy away from God's light and conceal their secrets beneath a veil of lies. There, away from sight, they fester and rot, spreading a foul contagion that poisons the very soul of Russia.\n\nFortunately, there remains a sliver of light in even the most benighted souls. With the clink of coins and the click of a cocked gun, the people of Russia can be lured or nudged onto the correct path. With a little persistence, all the dark secrets of the lowly shall be revealed, and the Regent's faithful servants will see them expunged."
 NIK_burgsys_improve_on_our_knowledge_desc:0 "Loyal, observant watchmen are a blessing to the Regent, but they are still human - still imperfect. We cannot grow complacent in our trust of them, for the flesh is weak and the human heart filled to bursting with sin. Only the greatest among us are truly safe from the Devil's temptations.\n\nBut the machine has none of these flaws. Steel, copper and plastic might corrode, but they will never betray us or fail in their duty. Wire-taps, surveillance cameras, hidden microphones - these marvels of technology will grant the Regent a sliver of the Lord's own omniscience and omnipresence. So armed, our sacred peace is assured."
 NIK_burgsys_honor_the_blessed_regent_desc:0 "Some place their trust in money. Some place their trust in weapons of war. Some, wretched beyond all others, place their trust in the iconoclasm of ideology. We, of all the world's nations, know better.\n\nWe, the Russians, place our trust in Sergey Taboritsky, Blessed Regent of His Imperial Majesty Tsarevich Alexei Romanov, true heir to the Russian Empire. Anointed with the blood of unbelievers, his reign is divinely mandated by the Lord God and eternally sanctioned in the name of Christ. The Lord has chosen him as His vessel and the harbinger of the Empire's return to glory, carrying forth the eternal light of the Third Rome. Only the Regent has been imparted with the Lord's own wisdom and power - only he can truly claim legitimacy over all the Russias. So shall it be until the Tsarevich is found and restored to his rightful throne!"
 NIK_burgsys_imperial_artwork_desc:0 "Russia's culture, once the pure inheritor of Rome's legacy, has been polluted to the point that the Regent weeps to even behold it. A thousand different and equally degenerate influences now sully every form of art in our beautiful nation. Worst of all are the idolatrous and perverse scrawlings of the Bolsheviks, venerating the proletarian rabble and their abominable, atheistic state above all else.\n\nTrue art, directly from the halcyon years of the Romanovs, is the only acceptable expression of Russian culture. All Bolshevik filth must be scourged away with fire, along with the scribblings of vile writers like Pasternak, the Jewish infiltrator."
 NIK_burgsys_cult_of_the_tsarevich_desc:0 "Wherever Tsarevich Alexei is hiding, surely he is living a most blessed life. Raised by gentle, caring men of God, he has certainly been instilled with all the virtues of a great and holy ruler. More than that, he carries the sanctified blood of his martyred father within his veins, setting him above all other men. Even among the racially superior of the world, he must be the most exemplary specimen.\n\nAll the people of Russia should know this, from the lowliest peasant to the highest noble. The Tsarevich is the sacred prince promised directly to our Regent by the Lord. He shall be as glorious and perfect in form and mind as Christ himself, King of Kings and Ruler of Rulers. Our Golden Child, our Blessed Prince of Longing - all of Russia shall know of your glory, from now 'til Judgement Day. Your Regent shall ensure that none ever heed the voice of Satan and defy you as the Jew-Tatar Lenin did. By enshrining the Regent's unworthy, earthly authority, the stage shall forever be set for you to assume the throne in perpetual, unquestioned peace."
 NIK_burgsys_trustworthy_court_desc:0 "Every Tsar must have his court; so must regents, logically. We have accumulated a vast number of devoted followers over the decades, from wizened White emigres to youthful radicals bursting with vigor. The true path illuminated so many years ago by Regent Taboritsky is now walked by thousands of the faithful.\n\nYet the situation is not as it should be. We have heard disturbing rumors from our little birds who keep watch on the ambitious and the powerful. It seems that certain inclinations have begun to take root recently; inclinations towards dissent, heresy... even treachery. Unfortunate, but villainous courtiers have ever been the lot of good-hearted rulers. Adjustments shall be made, so that Tsarevich Alexei will never face such a threat. Once the fate of traitors becomes known, fear shall permanently cow those who aspired to follow in their footsteps."
 NIK_burgsys_fall_of_the_favorite_desc:0 "The Regent walks in Christ's footsteps, lighting the way for Russia to follow. He is no Messiah, but he does strive to emulate one. It is not surprising, then, that another man would strive to emulate Judas: Pyotr Shabelsky-Bork, an old and dear friend, has become a most problematic element in the imperial court. Speaking with the forked tongue of Satan, he has dared to confront the Regent with 'concerns about his increasingly erratic behaviour'.\n\nCould the machinations of Beelzebub be any more obvious? This is the prelude to a betrayal most foul - no doubt Shabelsky-Bork already has his thirty pieces of silver! All he needs now is a rope of straw that he might be sent, blue-faced and choking, to the same eternal prison as his infernal master. In his place, a younger, more godly man shall be elevated to become the right hand of the Regent."
 NIK_burgsys_towards_absolute_purity_desc:0 "It is not enough for those who rule to be pure of heart. The lands of Russia are infested with a multitude of vermin: Jews, Tatars, Asiatics. These parasites suckle themselves on the lifeblood of the Empire, growing fat and healthy at the expense of God's chosen people.\n\nNo longer shall the noisome presence of subhumans be tolerated in our holy empire. Time and again, they have betrayed Russia, always pursuing the allure of wealth and self-aggrandizement. After every betrayal, they beg and plea for their miserable lives, appealing to the good Christian morals of their rightful rulers. Many were thus deceived, but not the Regent. For all their faults, the Germans, guided by God, have shown us the way. With bullets, blades, fire and gas, we shall forever cleanse Russia of its enemies."
 NIK_burgsys_repurpose_the_gulags_desc:0 "The Bolsheviks, perfidious Jews that they are, have devised many tools with which to oppress God's chosen people. None were so cruel and dehumanizing as the gulags: prison camps in the forgotten reaches of Russia where countless millions were sent to starve or freeze to death in the name of revolution.\n\nHowever, their wicked schemes shall be their final undoing. We shall take their precious gulags from them, round up the subhuman traitors, and drive them into the depths of their own creations! There, they shall toil away until they die, all to our benefit! Turning the weapons of the enemy against him is of grave danger to one's soul - but it is nevertheless a most satisfying thing to do."
 NIK_burgsys_ray_of_light_desc:0 "The only thing that subhumans hate more than the good and the pure is their own kind. The Germans demonstrated that well during their conquests; Ukrainians, Balts and Poles were easily manipulated by their new masters into turning their aggressions against the Jewish rats infesting their lands. Why, if not for such unwitting collaboration, the Germans might never have enjoyed such a high degree of success.\n\nWe have learned this lesson well. The inferior races of Russia will be shown the faces of their true oppressors and given a little encouragement. Spurred on by their base, primitive urges, they will no doubt busy themselves with infighting. That will diminish their numbers and make our task far easier to carry out."
 NIK_burgsys_harsh_glare_desc:0 "The Regent's people need no collaborators or stooges to help bear their burden. Russia has always stood by itself - a lone tree standing defiant against ill winds. Our virtues and strength are all we need to triumph over the subhumans.\n\nWe shall prove it. Jews, Tatars, Kalmyks, Komi, Udmurts, Buryats - none are a match for the iron will of the Russians. They will be rounded up, incarcerated and exterminated down to the last of their mewling, demonic spawn. Some may question our right to slaughter millions; those who understand realize that we have no right to let them live!"
 NIK_burgsys_bounties_on_parasites_desc:0 "The Regent, blessed as he may be, is not possessed of the Lord's omnipresence. Though he wishes it were not so, he cannot spare the time to be directly involved in the righteous purgation of our lands. In his stead, loyal servants must act - but there is a distinct shortage of such individuals. The commoners must be encouraged to serve him, so that they are prepared to do the same for the Tsarevich.\n\nFor this to happen, they must first be convinced of the necessity of our ideals. The fastest way to a man's heart is by satisfying his material needs, and Russia has so, so many people in dire need. Perhaps incentivizing involvement in our racial holy war would suffice... backed up by necessary reminders of the importance of this mission. After all, he who allows the subhuman to live shares in the crime of its existence."
 NIK_burgsys_glorious_new_day_desc:0 "What we have accomplished here in the west is only the beginning. From this old heartland of the Empire, the light of our Lord and His earthly representative, Tsarevich Alexei, will shine forth. Soon, it shall illuminate all of Russia, from Malorossiya to Vladivostok. The subhumans will be utterly destroyed and the pure race never again threatened by their ilk.\n\nBut not yet. There is so much more to do, so many evils to vanquish and souls to save. Beyond our borders, false claimants to the rulership of Russia send forth their armies to oppose us. Foolishly, they dismiss our claim to divine sponsorship, refusing to even acknowledge the truth of the Tsarevich's existence. They are wrong, of course, and will know it once we cast them into Hell and establish the eternal Holy Russian Empire across the entirety of its rightful lands!"
 
 NIK_burgsys_wealth_of_russia_desc:0 "United, Russia would be the largest and wealthiest nation in all of creation. Great swathes of verdant agricultural land stretch from Ukraine to the depths of Eurasia. Beneath the earth, there is a veritable bounty of mineral resources: iron, coal, gold and a thousand more gifts of God besides. Standing above it all, ready to exploit and be exploited in turn, are countless millions of the faithful, meat for the grinder.\n\nSadly, the majority of Russia is out of our reach for now. The Regency must make do with what the Lord has provided us. The entirety of our land's wealth must be put to use immediately and with maximum possible efficiency to begin the reclamation of the lands beyond the Urals."
 NIK_burgsys_tear_down_their_failures_desc:0 "Nowhere is the degeneracy and failure of Bolshevism more apparent than in its architecture and industry. Hideous concrete edifices, shrines to their inhumanity, litter Russia's idyllic lands. What use is any of this if it fails to adequately glorify Russia and its God?\n\nThere is no other option - it all has to go. It must be torn down and pulverized to dust, with hammers, saws, dynamite... even artillery if necessary. The Lord will never bless our economic endeavours if we permit Red blasphemy to continue existing in any form. The sooner we carry out this cleansing, the more certain we can be of His favor."
 NIK_burgsys_imperial_corporations_desc:0 "Predictably, the remnants of the Bolshevik economy we have inherited are nothing short of pathetic. Their obsession with ensuring adherence to their mad ideology only impoverished the people of Russia and made them easy prey for the Germans. Little better were their limited attempts at capitalism in a red guise - any man of God knows that capitalists are a threat to the proper hierarchy of a godly society.\n\nWith the Regent's guidance, such pitfalls will be avoided. Total state control is necessary, but turning God's people against one another will achieve little. Let the nobles have their riches, as they deserve, and remind the common folk of the shared duty of the classes. Let Red 'commissariats' and liberal 'free enterprise' give way to the good sense and responsibility of the Imperial Charter Corporations. That is how it always should have been."
 NIK_burgsys_riches_of_the_earth_desc:0 "Beneath the soil of Russia lies more mineral wealth than we could ever find a use for. The Bolsheviks never exploited this properly - the Lord saw their degenerate atheism and concealed the greatest of creation's riches from their crude machines.\n\nHowever, the land is now worked by God's chosen people! We have thus found no shortage of vital resources such as tungsten, aluminum and iron. These material blessings must be unearthed as quickly and efficiently as possible; thankfully, we have no shortage of strong backs to carry the task out, as well as subhuman fodder for the riskiest work. Only with the mines and pits stripped bare can the Regent see his holy mission fulfilled!"
 NIK_burgsys_confiscation_economy_desc:0 "There are many in Russia who never deserved to be wealthy. Scheming Jews who plied the wicked trade of moneylending; steppe-dwelling barbarians who pillaged our homes; uppity peasants who forgot their place in society.\n\nThese parasites, and any others of their like, will no longer be permitted to hoard their ill-gotten gains while the Empire is left wanting. Their 'property' is now God's - and, therefore, the Regent's. It shall finally be put to good use, fuelling the reconstruction of a pure, holy Russia while the thieves and subhumans of the world do their penance in mines and factories."
 NIK_burgsys_honor_in_a_humble_life_desc:0 "The love of money is the root of all evil. What use does a peasant or laborer have for gold, jewels and fine silks? Why does he need a fine town house, with gilded furniture and a necklace of pearls for his humble wife? What use are any of these things in the face of eternal damnation?\n\nAll the common man needs is provided for him already by the Lord, who created the proper and sanctified order of things. Hard work, prayer, family, absolute faith in God and the Tsar - these things were given unto him by Heaven, and they are not his to reject. This is the rightful lot of all the common folk, and the Regent will see this divine order maintained at any cost."
 NIK_burgsys_grand_industrial_project_desc:0 "As we are a pious, ascetic nation, we have no need of mass-produced trinkets and baubles to keep the plebeian folk amused. Thus, all the space that would be occupied by light industry and selfish capitalist ventures remains free - free, specifically, for the enormous amounts of heavy industry that we require to make Russia great again.\n\nArms factories, chemical plants, oil refineries, foundries and quarries are all needed to ignite the fires of industry. All of it, from the smallest operation to the grandest factory complex, will be directed solely towards forging the greatest army Russia has ever seen. Until the Tsarevich reigns supreme over a godly and peaceful land, nothing else is worthy of our efforts."
 NIK_burgsys_build_on_the_ruins_desc:0 "With only dust and ashes remaining of the Bolsheviks' buildings, we can now begin to construct simpler, more fitting replacements. These new buildings will be designed from the most basic level to glorify God, Russia and the Tsarevich.\n\nAll other concerns are secondary. Whether our new factories and facilities appear safe or practical to the scaled eyes of heretics and traitors is irrelevant. The Regent speaks with God's own voice, and he assures the people that so long as they have faith, they need never fear the dangers that blight the industry of lesser nations. If a man loses his arm in a thresher, or is cooked alive in a blast of steam, he only has himself to blame for lacking sufficient faith in God's protection."
 NIK_burgsys_cathedrals_of_industry_desc:0 "If modern industry has a major shortcoming, it is the total absence of religion. When workers are toiling their hours away, their ears are filled only with the clamor of machinery. As their hands are so occupied with honest work, so too should their ears be open to holy benedictions and hymns, to soothe their spirits and remind them that laboring for the Regent is a sacred duty.\n\nBut that's not enough. The arms and equipment churned out by our factories will be worse than useless if they are not adequately blessed. For our army to gain the Lord's favor, their gear must be consecrated in His name, and there is no better place to do this than at the source. By assigning a priest to every factory, the proper rites can be conducted and our weapons imbued with divine purpose."
 NIK_burgsys_no_land_untouched_desc:0 "Oil, one of God's greatest gifts to the chosen race, will be vital in the rebuilding of our empire and the coming wars of reunification. We already have a decent flow of this black gold from sources such as Ukhta, but we need more. Much more.\n\nSurveyors have already found trace amounts in our land; if there are any wellsprings hiding beneath the earth, they must be opened up immediately. God has given the Empire the means to keep its oil industry independent from the Elders of Zion and their Mahometan puppets. The fuel for our engines of war will be just as pure as the pious Russians who drew it forth."
 NIK_burgsys_fill_imperial_treasury_desc:0 "The Imperial Treasury is beginning to fill, but only at a slow pace. The realities of economics are not lost on the Regent; a solution is required. Trade is naturally out of the question, since it brings with it the risk of Jewish infiltration. Thankfully, there are a number of answers to the money question within our borders.\n\nNaturally, we shall further the practice of seizing property. Russia has no shortage of wicked plutocrats who deserve none of what they possess. There could also be many commoners, some secretly Jewish no doubt, who possess concealed fortunes built up over the years. Whatever the source, it all belongs to the Empire!"
 NIK_burgsys_in_the_green_desc:0 "Drawing on further divinely-inspired lessons from Kaukasia, the Regent has decreed that the Empire's economy will be purely functional in nature, with no superfluous spending of any sort. Everything of value will be accounted for and placed in the hands of the wise and worthy.\n\nLogically, without any funds going to waste, the Empire will be economically invincible. We will always have enough treasure to keep the coffers topped up and the army fed. God and His Regent will take care of the rest."
 NIK_burgsys_imperial_opulence_desc:0 "Bolsheviks and other rabble-rousers frequently referred to the grandeur and wealth of the Tsar when they sought to convert gullible peasants. Jealousy is an easily-roused emotion, particularly for intellectually stunted commoners.\n\nWhat they failed to understand is that opulence is only a bad thing when it represents a sinful love of materialism; for example, the overwrought townhouse of a scheming Jew stuffed with gilded furniture. Contrasting this, the opulence associated with imperial rule is perfectly logical and has divine approval. The Lord demands that His temple be the most splendid and beautiful building on earth; as His living representative, the Tsar (and therefore the Regent) is clearly the intended benefactor of this decree."
 NIK_burgsys_black_budget_desc:0 "Modern economics are utterly farcical. What use have God and His people for nebulous, flawed and purely man-made terminology? Why should we even pay attention to the words of money-obsessed men in a profession infested with Jews?\n\nThe Regent is possessed of the Lord's sacred wisdom and knows all the world's truths. There are no flaws or errors in our economic programs or policies. Everything has been perfectly calculated with the aid of divine revelation. All that lesser men need to know is this: the economic affairs of the Empire are the exclusive domain of the Regent and his chosen few. Anybody else who attempts to involve themselves is nothing more than Judeo-Bolshevik agitator and will be dealt with appropriately."
 NIK_burgsys_absolute_truth_desc:0 "Foreigners - mostly Jewish and Masonic puppets, we suspect - frequently wonder aloud how our economy can ever be sustainable. How, without embracing trade with the perfidious subhumans of the world, are we to endure?\n\nThe answer is obvious to all but the most truly stupid people. Gold. Gold is all humanity has ever needed to form the bedrock of an economy. It has been that way for thousands of years, and is ordained by God. Furthermore, we have plenty of it. There are massive vaults, far from the clammy grasp of avaricious Jews, that are filled to bursting with gold and other valuables. This is all we need, and all we shall ever need. How else can one possibly explain our productivity?"
 NIK_burgsys_virtuous_education_desc:0 "Last but not least of our concerns are the minds of our children. The youths of Russia have long been deprived of a proper education by Judeo-Bolshevik oppression; truly, the Elders of Zion know no limits to their demented schemes.\n\nThe Regent sees their plight and has heard their cries for help. Now, the children of Russia shall have what they need: proper education, from cradle to grave, formulated by the Regent himself for maximum efficiency. It is only right for them to learn every minutiae necessary, that they might correctly serve the Tsarevich when he ascends to the throne. Tended properly, he will never have to hear unwanted questions from a rowdy and ill-minded populace."
 NIK_burgsys_sins_of_the_past_desc:0 "The 'intellectual' class has never been worthy of the Empire's trust. It is from academia, not the peasantry, that corruptive ideas of equality, Bolshevism and capitalism emerged. They are a perpetual fifth column, a thorn in the side of Russia spreading a vile infection. No longer.\n\nThe only rational and moral solution is a nation-wide purge of these dissidents. Anyone who cannot prove that he is with us in totality is against us - and the Regent has no mercy for the enemies of God. Once they have received their just punishment, a new intellectual order shall be founded on their bones: an order dedicated to true science, purified of demonic materialism."
 
 NIK_burgsys_imperial_army_desc:0 "Now that western Russia is fully under our authority, and major internal rivals disposed of, we can finally end our reliance on paramilitaries and the barely-loyal military remnants of the wretched Republic of Komi. Such rabble are undeserving of the Regent's command.\n\nIn their place, the Imperial Army will finally return after nearly fifty years of its absence. It will not be quite the same institution; the weaknesses that plagued it and contributed to its many defeats must be excised. There will be many trials ahead for our reborn empire and the Imperial Army will be the spine that keeps it standing upright. None shall find them wanting."
 NIK_burgsys_no_law_but_the_regents_desc:0 "There is no international law. That concept was created by the Jews and their minions to protect their evil race from the righteous cleansing they deserve. Lesser claimants to rulership might be swayed by the honeyed lies of Cain's kindred, but the Regent understands that the only valid law is God's. There are no boundaries created by man that cannot be crossed in service of Holy Russia.\n\nThe protests of the feeble and the heathen will no longer be heeded. Chemical weapons are God's gift to the armies of Christendom and no less central to our doctrine than guns, planes and tanks. Once again, they will have their rightful place as standard-issue weapons for the entire military."
 NIK_burgsys_through_the_fog_desc:0 "Knowledge is power. Only through extensive monitoring of our internal situation do we keep subversives at bay and thus continue to enjoy the Lord's favor. The same is true of our military situation.\n\nOur enemies are far better at concealing themselves from the Regent's burning gaze than the common folk are, but nothing can hide them forever. God has granted man many gifts that allow us to share in His omniscience: sonar, radar and encryption, just to name a few. The Imperial Army must have access to all of these and more, so that it can never be blindsided by our wicked foes."
 NIK_burgsys_expand_on_the_arsenal_desc:0 "The Syktyvkar Arsenal is a welcome blessing, its vaults packed from floor to ceiling with canisters of gas and the means to deploy them. However, after running a tally of its inventory, we have found that current supplies are inadequate for regular use.\n\nBut the Lord provides. In a sealed section of the vaults, concealed from the sight of the sinful, we found the greatest gift of all: a supplied and fully functional chemical weapons production plant. Though the facility is small, the acquisition of base ingredients for the creation of gas is a simple matter. Production can therefore almost immediately. The facility is also quite old, and therefore relatively easy to duplicate. Praise God for bestowing such fruits of Heaven upon us!"
 NIK_burgsys_clouds_on_the_horizon_desc:0 "Though the Germans enjoyed overwhelming success in their invasion of the Soviet Union, they never went far enough. Perhaps they lacked the stomach, or simply the foresight, to ensure the total pacification of their conquests. Yes, their columns of Panzers, Stukas and gray-clad infantry were impressive. But what if they had embraced the glorious horror of chemical warfare? How many lives could have been saved and degenerates exterminated, if every assault was preceded by a storm of gas-spewing shells, and every defense bolstered with an invisible wall of phosgene?\n\nThe Regent and his army will hold no such reservations. For the preservation of the pure and the utter extermination of the wicked, the liberal use of gas and smoke on the battlefield will be mandated.

Perhaps we should turn from the established officer corps and look to the ranks of the faithful for promising candidates. They will need to be strong-willed and pure of heart.

The common soldiery were no better, stripped of independent thought by years of communist indoctrination. All they could do was throw themselves at the Germans in human waves; a fitting end, but laughably ineffective.\n\nWe are not so foolish. The Russian Empire was never militarily defeated in the Great War; it was brought down from within by the knives of Judas. The brilliance of White Army heroes like Kornilov and Denikin is indisputable, and will be the foundation of our new tactical doctrines. The wisdom of the old Empire will guide us to victory everlasting!"

We cannot expect them to remain useful in their current form forever.\n\nResearch and development initiatives must begin at once, at the Regent's command. Germany alone could teach us much, but true genius will be only found in the minds of the Regent's chosen. Already, our brilliant engineers and scientists, aided by the Holy Spirit, have proposed a dozen new solutions to the needs of our holy warriors.

In our veins flows the blood of Heraclius, Justinian and Constantine the Great. No matter how deprived or misfortunate we might be, we will always remain God's chosen warriors and the purest race in all Creation.\n\nThe Regent decrees that all good people of Russia be made aware of this fact. War is in our blood; within every able-bodied Russian man dwells the martial might of the Archangel Michael! That will be decisively proven, even if every man capable of firing a gun has to be conscripted and scourged until he finds his fighting spirit!

Infiltrators will surface from time to time, but they cannot hide for long. A focus on instilling loyalty, piety and ferocity in battle into the men will both improve our army's quality and fumigate the ranks.

A pure-blooded Russian can endure any level of human suffering imaginable and come out stronger. Even the slightest amount of subhuman blood will cause them to 'wash out' - but that's no great loss.

Key to his plans is his ideology, that of "Compassionate Conservatism."

All the hard work they put in will be repaid tenfold in the community that they will be able to participate in. All the work they do is for the public good, not just for them, but for all of us.

However, while cooperation birthed by convenience would be beneficial to both us and the Americans, they may be reluctant at accepting our unique cultural formation as part of the so-called Free World. It would be therefore to our advantage if we send a delegation to the OFN, and bridge the gap of our differences sooner rather than later."

In many ways abandoned by her Western allies, she suffered and bled, and eventually tragically perished under the jackboot of the Reich.

Worse yet, any tank we design must have the armor to tank a shell or two from a German tank and hit back just as hard.

Unfortunately, in order to be able to embark upon such a mission, we must first reorganize the state in accordance with Ordosocialist doctrine. We had neglected to do so earlier, in the hopes that the people would fall in line and work with the party, but it appears we were mistaken. The rot of the Suslov and his cosmopolitan illusions reeks still, and if we are to bring Russia back to its former glory and power, it must be cleansed, purified by fire, possibly by firing squad if need be."

These things might be relatively minor, like the use of certain words or maybe a manner of speech, to egregious things, like professing an interest in a reactionary ideology or even questioning the great Serov. Once that list is complete, we will create another list. This list will have the names of all the people about whom we noticed things.

The information we gather will be used to create a plan of action based on these ideas and concerns of the people rooted in Ordosocialism, with the intent of relieving any problems they might have. Hopefully, this will strengthen the party's relationship with the masses."

We must expand our network of informants and agents in order to match the pace at which our nation is expanding. Western Russia houses a lot of people, many of which may harbor ill intent to our benevolent regime. In order to amend this, not only must our clandestine agency grow in size, but it must also grow in influence. Our officers and agents must become more active and involved. There should be an officer in every school and an agent in every home. Such a presence will take time and effort, but the results will be well worth it. After all, all we do, we do for the people."

These students are to be the future of Russia, let's be sure to teach them well."
 NIK_natsoc_the_state_forming_nation_desc:0 "Russia, though more divided and separate than it has been in generations, retains one key aspect that no other nation on this Earth can claim.

When Russia is once again reunited, this time under Ordosocialism, we will assume our role as vanguard against all the evils of the world, whether that be facism, capitalism, or cosmopolitanism. From the ashes, our Russian state will arise anew."
 NIK_natsoc_the_socialist_unitarism_desc:0 "The federative institutions that marked the old Soviet regime have no place in our new nation. No only is such a system of governance inefficient, but it is also a threat to the party. By allowing regional governments to govern themselves under a federal setup, we invite the chance for said governments to work against us, to plot in secret, even to rebel. We mustn't allow it. Additionally, a unitary government will allow for more efficient use of resources and a simplified management of the economy, as all executive decision making and bureaucratic implementation is centralized."
 NIK_natsoc_the_russian_union_desc:0 "With the Soviet Union of old destroyed, we have been granted an opportunity to reshape what the foundation of what the Soviet Union can even be. Our new Soviet nation will, at its core, be a Russian nation first and foremost. Suslov's ideas of a union in which all races are equal is simply unfeasible, given the inherent superiority of the Russian people. These illusions of equality between the races of the Soviet Union is partially what led to its collapse in the first place. Thus, if a new Soviet Union is to be created, it must be created with the Russian people at its core ruling the nation."
 NIK_natsoc_the_national_unity_desc:0 "Ordosocialism, while already having been extremely successful in its spread across Russia thus far, is rather undefined. That is to say, while the broad strokes of the ideology have been explored, such as the ideas of Russian supremacy and preeminence of the state in society, we have no ideological aspirations. It's easy to say that we should reunite Russia and reconquer Moscowien, ending German influence in Russia once and for all, but what of after? What will our new Russia look like? How should the Russian people strive to be? We must answer these questions."
 NIK_natsoc_the_revolutionary_succession_desc:0 "Despite what others have said about our ideology, Ordosocialism is very much a leftist ideology. We should embrace this revolutionary, progressive, and socialist identity and use it to our advantage. There are still many who yearn for the old Soviet Union, and believe in the old ways of communism. By embracing the leftist nature of our ideology, we might be able to reach out and integrate them into the cause. Whether they be former Suslovites, hardcore communists, or moderate socialists, we welcome them all with open arms."
 NIK_natsoc_our_own_way_desc:0 "It is a sad fact that in the earlier years of reunification, proponents of Ordosocialism had to align themselves with right wing groups in order to carry out our ideological goals. Unfortunately, such groups have become a thorn in our side as we have begun to consolidate our political power under Serov. They project the image that the party isn't unified in its goals and ideals, and that projects weakness. They will have to be expelled from the party, and should they continue to be so vocal about their views on Ordosocialism after they leave, then we will have to use other means to deal with them."
 NIK_natsoc_red_white_reconciliation_desc:0 "Ordosocialism isn't one monolithic mode of thought or ideology. It is an ideology with the capacity to change and adapt. In this case, in order to further the party's interests and influence in Russia at large, we will need to appeal to a broader range of Russians who ascribe to all sorts of politics. To that end, we should seek to incorporate the right wing into the Ordosocialist apparatus of the party. Accepting these people into the fold can only serve to strengthen us in our interests going forward."
 NIK_natsoc_together_to_greatness_desc:0 "In order to mend the rift that has grown between the leftist Ordosocialists and the right wing Ordosocialists, we should approach some right wing leaders with offers of positions in government. These positions won't be glamorous or particularly powerful, but it would go a long way towards normalizing and improving relations with them. This may slightly weaken Serov's power within the party, but by opening up our candidate selection pool for jobs in the government to people further to the right, we will also be expanding our talent pool, increasing the government's ability to find skilled candidates for jobs."
 NIK_natsoc_the_proletarian_nation_desc:0 "At the heart of Ordosocialism lies the Russian worker. The proletariat is and will always be the most important aspect of Ordosocialism, and of Russia as a whole. After all, Russia is the birthplace of the revolution, of socialism as a viable ideology. We must cling to this identity, even in the face of the oppressive German and Japanese Empires. The conspiracy of international capital against Russia will be avenged, but only through faith in Russia and the party can this be achieved."

Intolerance to the enemies of Russia.\n12. Brotherly solidarity to all Russians within our nation."
 NIK_natsoc_the_reawoken_consciousness_desc:0 "The new Soviet man can be described as a lot of things. He is intelligent and educated, well versed in traditional marxist-leninist literature as well as more modern Ordosocialist literature. He is watchful and vigilant, reporting to the proper authorities any misdeeds or crimes he sees. He is patriotic and nationalistic, secure in the knowledge that Russia and the Soviet Union stand higher than any other nations on this Earth. Above all else though, he is loyal, obeying the state and having full faith in Serov's wisdom and guidance. This is the new Soviet man, and you will become him, if not for patriotism, then for your life."
 NIK_natsoc_national_economy_policy_desc:0 "The former economic policy of the Soviet Union wasn't necessarily bad, it simply wasn't properly suited for military industry production, and it didn't prioritize development of the most important region of the Soviet Union, Russia, as much as it should have. We will rectify this mistake when designing our new economic policy for Russia. This time, all developmental resources will be directed towards the core Russian territory, and this development will focus on military production and construction."
 NIK_natsoc_the_tactical_prudence_desc:0 "While state ownership of military and heavy industry is both necessary and desirable for both the party and Russia, it may be beneficial for us to allow some private ownership of small businesses and land. It may be distasteful for some in the party to have to relinquish such control, but allowing the people free right to entrepreneurship and private property will help restart the economy and encourage growth. Additionally, if fears of radical ideas infecting the populace in the concern, then they should have no fear. Such entrepreneurs and small business owners will be watched very carefully."
 NIK_natsoc_the_commissars_of_industry_desc:0 "This idea of workplace democracy is both ridiculous and inefficient. While this notion of workplace democracy may satisfy the worker, it's simply terrible for maximizing productivity from a factory. Our factories will not be run in such a manner. Factories will be run just as our government is, cleanly organized and centralized with a strict hierarchy and chain of command. At the top of this chain is the industrial Commissar. He commands the factory and gives the men day to day instructions and orders. He is the lynchpin of the whole operation, and we must find men who are suitable to take these positions across the country."
 NIK_natsoc_the_national_accountability_desc:0 "The capitalist system is vile, but if nothing else, it provides great motivation for individuals to succeed. Failure in business or the economy can lead to factories closing or a man losing his job. That sort of fear of failure is excellent for motivation, and we should seek to simulate that concept cost accounting for our planned economy. Factories that don't produce as much as they should or can will be warned once. Continual failure to meet quotas will result in less and less funding, until closure if necessary. Successful factories that meet or even exceed quotas will be rewarded with more resources for them to use and expand with. These factories will be accountable for their own survival."
 NIK_natsoc_one_big_cooperative_desc:0 "Russia is a large and diverse nation, a fact only accentuated by this period of warlordism. It similarly has a large and diverse economy, with many different players and economic philosophies. Market liberalism, state capitalism, marxists planned economics, laissez faire economics, we have it all. However, this diversity of thought is a weakness. Our economic structure is the only correct one, and it would help others to understand this. To that end, we have created an economic union in which all the major economic players of our nation will work with one another. Together, they will pursue the common goals of class consciousness within our nation and work towards an economically productive tomorrow."
 NIK_natsoc_the_refined_gosplan_desc:0 "The Gosplan was the original central planning committee of the Soviet Union. It was the main driver and planning system behind the Soviet economy, existing from 1921 until it's dissolution in '45. The guiding principle behind the Gosplan was the idea of the planned economy, an avenue through which the state could control the economy and ensure prosperity and safety. We will create a new Gosplan, whose focus will be on building our military industrial complex into one of the most formidable on Earth, with productive capabilities to match. Soon, even Germany will be eclipsed by our economic might."
 NIK_natsoc_the_ordosocialist_household_desc:0 "What did the old Tsarist regime fall so many years ago? A strange question, but one worth asking. It wasn't the brutal treatment of serfs, or Tsar Nicholas' poor leadership, or even the war. In the end, it came down to bread. The people were starving, and when people are wracked with hunger at the brink of death, they will do whatever they think they have to do to fix their situation. Oftentimes, this turns into rage against the government. Agriculture must be a priority in order to avoid such a fate for our government. Farms will be collectivized under state leadership to maximise output, and the people housed in state controlled homes. The Ordosocialist household will be one of plenty."
 NIK_natsoc_the_transformation_of_nature_desc:0 "Our population is growing, and some within our government predict that we will experience a population boom now that Russia is finally stabilizing again. Soon, our nutritional needs may well surpass our capacity for production. A number of daring plans and ideas for boosting agricultural yields have been put forward in order to address the problem before it ever becomes a real issue. These plans range from clearcutting forests for more agricultural land to a plan that would divert water from rivers feeding into the Aral sea to irrigate new farmlands."
 NIK_natsoc_mending_the_industry_desc:0 "Russia's industry lies broken after so many years of bombing and internal wars. However, among the rubble lies an opportunity to create a Russia stronger than ever before. Bukharin was a fool and traitor for many reasons, but the most important was in how he handled our industry. His lack of focus on heavy industry meant that when the time came to fight, we had no factories to forge the implements with which to defend ourselves. We will not repeat his mistakes. Reconstruction and economic reorganization are already underway, and this time we will make sure that heavy industry is front and center at the core of our new economy."
 NIK_natsoc_forging_the_shield_and_sword_desc:0 "As a great man once said, "The only real power comes out the end of a long rifle". Unfortunately, Russia has a severe lack of rifles. In fact, Russia has a severe lack of almost every weapon. Tanks, planes, rifles, and artillery are all in short supply. A similar situation exists with our airfields, naval bases, and defensive fortifications. Simply put, Russia is rather weak right now, and even a relatively small invasion force from Germany could topple us. We must rectify this situation. Resources must be put towards building up our military industry to fend off would be invaders and secure our borders."
 NIK_natsoc_the_revolutionary_adventurism_desc:0 "The future of the Russian economy lies in the state. Moderate and social democrats warn against the sort of revolutionary political adventurism that we are pushing. They lack the will to fully reject the corporatist and capitalist systems of Italy and the United States. We have no such restrictions. We must continue and expand the process of nationalization in all industries. Under the government's control, we will bring Russia closer to the sort of autarkic self-sufficiency that other nations Germany have strived towards."
 NIK_natsoc_collective_vanguardism_desc:0 "The people of Russia must understand that through our collective will, Russia can achieve anything. There is no greater expression of this collective will than the workers collective. The people, working together in thousands of collectives across Russia to form an even greater expression of the people, the state. We must spread this message to the masses. They must understand that they are the engine, the driving force, the power that has brought Russia as far as it has. So long as they believe that they are what's driving our state forward, they won't feel any need to actually seize control."
 NIK_natsoc_attack_at_the_capital_desc:0 "There can be no private property, businesses, or financial institutions in the new Russia to come. The global conspiracy of capitalist and corporatist nations plotting against us is how we fell last time. Bukharin was far too liberal with the NEP, and we cannot afford to repeat the old fool's mistakes. Private property and institutions will be seized and nationalized at once. Those who volunteer their property quickly and cooperatively will be given rewards, like government positions or a large one time payment. Those who refuse will face execution."
 NIK_natsoc_a_leap_to_the_future_desc:0 "The introduction of socialism into Russia's economy must be accelerated if we are to protect ourselves from the capitalist and corporatist nations that threaten us on all sides. The idea that we need a grace period as we transition into a planned economic setup is not only foolish, but dangerous. The longer our economy remains open to the world, the more opportunities our enemies will have to exploit our weakness. We have the means and the will to implement socialism into the economy now, and we must if we wish to protect Russia from outside forces."
 NIK_natsoc_total_mobilization_desc:0 "Total mobilization is an interesting concept. It refers to the complete and total utilization of all resources a state is capable of mobilizing. To engage in the total mobilization of a nation is to convert said nation into an engine of war, consuming men and steel and machinery alike and pumping out soldiers and rifles and tanks and planes. Many nations view total mobilization as a last resort, something to be utilized only when all else has failed. In Ordosocialism, total mobilization is an ideal, a goal to strive towards. Only through the total mobilization of all Russia has to offer can we crush the capitalist and cosmopolitan forces of the world."
 NIK_natsoc_the_red_army_reborn_desc:0 "The Red Army that once swept across Russia was one that marched with purpose and motivation. That Red Army marched to spread socialism across Russia. It is important that it is understood that the Red Army never stopped marching. That Red Army is our own today, as our army is nothing more than a continuation of the Red Army that came before it. We share the same principles, the same doctrines, and most importantly, we share a similar ideology, one that we're certain the original Red Army would have marched to had they been aware of the Ordosocialism at the time."
 NIK_natsoc_encourage_new_officers_desc:0 "While the old guard have plenty of experience and knowledge from so many wars in years past, they really aren't the kind of people we want manning our army. Many of them have sworn allegiances a dozen times over to whoever they find themselves working for at the time. Whether it be fascists, traditional communist, capitalists, it matter not to them. All that matters is their safety and comfort, and if it takes a petty allegiance, then they will gladly proclaim allegiance all day and night.\n\nThere are surely hundreds, if not thousands of young, fresh soldiers with knowledge and experience from the Unification Wars as well as the devotion and loyalty towards Ordosocialism needed to be an officer. We should begin promoting these kinds of men to officer positions."
 NIK_natsoc_reinstate_the_commissars_desc:0 "Political commissars are meant to be among the most loyal and devoted men in our military. Their job is to ensure that the soldiers in our military remain as loyal to Ordosocialism as possible. Due to our former relationship with the right, it wasn't possible to have political commissars of any particular strength or effectiveness. Now, however, with Ordosocialists firmly in control of the government, we can have real political commissars, with loyalty and drive. They will be the vanguard, fighting on the front lines with our men and making sure that treason and disloyalty towards Ordosocialism remains nothing more than a fear, and not a threat."
 NIK_natsoc_an_eye_to_our_history_desc:0 "The Unification Wars were a gruelling and savage affair, but they served well to hone our military, much like a hunter hones a knife. In the aftermath of such a bloody conflict, we've learned quite a lot, and will be modifying our doctrines based on lessons we learned. We gained experience fighting in the varying terrains of Russia, we learned better how to manage our supply lines, and most importantly, our men got real combat to train with, and we can use their experiences to continue bettering our military. All forces train to win the last war that they fought."
 NIK_natsoc_the_legacy_of_the_great_patriotic_war_desc:0 "It was always Zhukov and Voroloshilov who had the right of it when it came to military affairs. Their ideas about using mass industrialized combat combined with more traditional Russian Army tactics were revolutionary, and had they implemented those ideas earlier in the war against Germany, we very well may have pushed the Hun back, and even won. We should endeavor to implement their ideas about warfare into our doctrines in an effort to modernise our military. Zhukov and Voroloshilov were great generals, let us not waste their insights."
 NIK_natsoc_the_bleeding_tomorrow_desc:0 "All forces train to win the last war that they fought, but it's the armies that prepare for the wars of the future that find victory. Technology is advancing at a rate unprecedented in history. It wasn't twenty years ago that the helicopters and intercontinental ballistic missiles we have today seemed like nothing more than science fiction, or twenty years before that when a bomb that could destroy an entire city was but a fantasy. The moral here is that better technology is always being created, and if we don't stay up to date and informed, we're going to learn about these new technologies the hard way. We must prepare for the battlefield of tomorrow. Either we're going to be at the bleeding edge of technology, or we're going to be impaled on it."
 NIK_natsoc_lessons_from_the_red_napoleon_desc:0 "Tuchachevsky was a genius on the battlefield if there ever was one. He was a giant on the battlefield, easily among the greatest generals of the Second World War and West Russian War. His doctrine regarding discipline and battle tactics was revolutionary in an era that has all but abandoned the excellence in the field. Technology is obviously important, but it's the general, the commander, and the captain with whom the focus should lie. If we can train our men to think on their feet and come up with creative solutions to dangerous situations, then we will have succeeded. The German relies on his guns, his tanks, and his missiles to do all the work, but he never thinks. None of those things will do him any good if he doesn't realize he's already been flanked."
 NIK_natsoc_developments_on_the_kalashnikov_desc:0 "The AK-47 is one of the finest rifles to come out of Russia possibly ever. It's cheap to produce, extremely reliable, has replaceable parts, and is simple to understand and use. As it stands, the rifle is unparalleled. This needs to change. While the design is superior in every capacity compared to older rifle models, this is rather unremarkable in the history of rifle developments. The next generation of guns will always be superior to the last, and the Ak-47's excellent design today may become obsolete tomorrow. We mustn't be content to rest on our laurels while rifle technology in other nations surges ahead."
 NIK_natsoc_applied_mbt_designs_desc:0 "Designing a tank suited for our particular needs is no simple task. Not only must it be reliable enough to trudge through the muddy swamps of Western Russia during Raputitsa, but it also must be fuel efficient enough to operate for enough hours or even a few days without refuelling. Worse yet, any tank we design must have the armor to tank a shell or two from a German tank and hit back just as hard. Our tank technology is now decades behind that of Germany, so developing such a tank will take time. Applying what lessons we learned from the Unification Wars would serve as a starting point at the very least."
 NIK_natsoc_away_from_the_ground_desc:0 "Despite what our generals say, the Army isn't the only branch involved in warfare, and it should not be focused on exclusively. Both our Navy and Air Force are in dire need of attention. Our Air Force is but a shell of the organization it once was decades ago, and that's to say nothing of our Navy, which, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists. It will take several years to bring either into any sort of military capable shape, and several more to match those of Germany or Japan. It will be expensive and time consuming, but rebuilding these branches of the military will be vital to our future success."
 NIK_natsoc_follow_golovkos_footsteps_desc:0 "Arseniy Golovko was a Soviet admiral who served in the Soviet Navy, specifically as Commander of the Red Banner Northern Fleet during the Second World War. His fleet, while small, served an important role protecting our northern waters in the White Sea. The Nazi's were never able to push with any success in the White Seas as a result of his excellent command, and his fleet even aided in a few offensives. Ultimately, we should hope to imitate his rather successful fleet. Forming a small, efficient commerce protection/raiding Northern Fleet would do us wonders in protecting northern trade during peacetime, and would protect ports and naval supply lines during wartime."
 NIK_natsoc_intelligence_on_the_field_desc:0 "Field intelligence in the military is arguably more important today than it ever has been in the past. Knowing where your enemy is and whether or not your enemy knows where you are could mean the difference between throwing a few artillery shells at the enemy and receiving a few instead. This distinction is made all the more important by the massive technological gap between us and our enemies. While we might be throwing shells at the enemy, they may see fit to launch missiles at us. Our reconnaissance ability will be vital in the wars to come, and it's important that we recognize this fact."
 NIK_natsoc_wings_over_the_motherland_desc:0 "The destruction the Luftwaffe has dealt Russia is unimaginable, by all accounts. A sustained, decade long bombing campaign indiscriminately destroying everything over a couple stories tall. The bombing campaign permanently scarred our people, and there isn't a Russian alve without a story to tell from those years. Such a thing can never be allowed to happen again. Our Air Force must become powerful enough to deter even the thought of engaging Russia in the air. Never again will our people see Luftwaffe planes over Russia skies."
 NIK_natsoc_a_new_sun_in_the_east_desc:0 "The spirit of revolution has been all but crushed worldwide. The oppressive German and Japanese regimes seek to smother anything even resembling a possible revolt or revolution. We must act as a counterbalance to their smothering effect. We will act as the sun to a seed, nourishing the revolutionary spirit and providing sustenance so that it one day might grow into a full blown revolution. A revolution to encompass the whole world, so that one day all oppressed peoples may be freed. Such a dream is a ways off, but all it takes to start is a seed and some sunlight."
 NIK_natsoc_clandestine_services_desc:0 "Russia needs a clandestine transportation and support network. Specifically, Russia needs the ability to move goods covertly. The goods can be anything, be it armaments, valuable metals, industrial machinery, it just needs to be able to send or acquire these goods surreptitiously. As our state grows more powerful, it will have greater need to be able to source items and materials without notice. The goal is to be able to call upon resources which can be plausibly deniable and difficult to source."
 NIK_natsoc_the_finnish_passage_desc:0 "Finland has a rather unique economic and political situation as far as European nations go. Finland is one of the only nations in Europe which possesses both access to the German economic bloc as well as its own independence. By permeating Finland with Russian agents, we might hopefully be able to covertly breach the German economic bloc and gain access to their markets. If we can move Russian goods in and out of Russia through Finland, we would successfully be avoiding a White Sea bottleneck as well as providing us a glimpse into the economic activities of Germany."
 NIK_natsoc_a_contest_for_bretagne_desc:0 "Bretagne is the undisputed capital of the black market underworld. Every product imaginable flows through their markets, from guns to tanks to information to people, the latter of which being the one we are most interested in. We mean people not only in the sense of Bretagnes trafficking operations which we can use to move around witnesses, agents, and other such assets, but also in the sense of access to powerful and corrupt leaders. Establishing contacts in Bretagne will help us towards this end."
 NIK_natsoc_the_swiss_connection_desc:0 "Hitler may very well have been right when he proclaimed so many years ago that the Swiss were the mortal enemies of Germany. Switzerland's global international banking system has a hand in almost every nation, from the United States to Japan to Germany. At this very moment, a network of several Swiss bank accounts are being registered in ours and several other fake names in Geneva, through which our contacts in America will begin dumping Japanese stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. This relationship with Switzerland is already having the looks of being extremely beneficial."
 NIK_natsoc_a_blueprint_for_struggle_desc:0 "Our unique ideology has put us in a rather compromising position. Most every other nation on this planet would see us fall, whether it be the national socialists in Germany, the fascists in Japan, or the capitalists in America. Thus, we must embrace a doctrine of critical support for any anti-capitalist or anti-colonialist/imperialist movements that might appear in the world.\n\nOur men in intelligence have created a standardized plan to follow in order whenever such a movement, rebellion, or revolution come to our attention. A basic blueprint to follow, which involves immediate shipments of armaments, capital, and advisors to aid in their struggle, in addition to long term volunteer deployments and international funneling of any other resources they might need. We must do everything in our power to aid these revolutions and further destabilize our enemies."
 NIK_natsoc_an_apparatus_for_liberation_desc:0 "We must turn our state into an efficient machine of worldwide resolution if we are to defeat the Capitalists and Corporatists of the world. Our state intelligence apparatus will have to ascend beyond that of a regional influencer. Our intelligence agency will itself become an international network of liberation movements and freedom fighters cooperating and coordinating under our global umbrella of support. Our global intelligence network will soon become even more influential and powerful than the CIA's."
 NIK_natsoc_saturate_the_west_desc:0 "A contingent of about 30 of our agents have recently been sent across the border into Moscowien. Their job is to make contact with anti-German activists and revolutionaries in the region. Once we've established connections with these groups, we will begin coordinating them with one another as we start moving supplies into the region. We will have our agents aid these groups in expanding and increasing recruitment. The more people we can radicalize, the better. Our ultimate goal is to prime the region to support Russia when the time comes for war with Germany, which we will attempt to do by energizing and expanding the anti-German movements in the region."
 NIK_natsoc_ensure_a_liquid_border_desc:0 "The border between Moscowien and Russia has been in flux for decades since the West Russian War. Official maps put the Moscowien-Russian border at the A-A line, despite the fact they haven't controlled Arkhangelsk since '54. Germany has more accurate internal maps, but those were further confused by the mess of warlord states whose borders with each other and Moscowien was always in flux. This liquid border made it exceptionally easy to move agents and other supplies across the border, something we've taken advantage of with some frequency.\n\nUnfortunately, since the unification of West Russia, Germany has made increasingly large scale attempts to pin down where the border is and lock it down, even contacting us for assistance. Given that it's in our best interest to continue Germany's border woes, we've made an effort to be as confusing as possible on the subject. We've had our diplomats tell Germany different information on where we believe the border to be. We've provided false information on geographical landmarks and other such locations on the border. Most impressively, we even uprooted and moved an entire border checkpoint on two occasions in order to confuse German cartographers sent to map the border. The liquid border will remain ensured."
 NIK_natsoc_pollinate_the_steppe_desc:0 "Kazakhstan and the rest of Central Asia will be invaluable allies in the future. Their position on the continent separates us from German aligned Iran and could provide us an avenue through which we could access India. We must saturate their lands with our own agents, allowing them to infiltrate their governments and orient their foreign policy towards our own ends. We should hope to, in time, have an agent at every level of government, from the low level bureaucrats to the highest level politicians."
 NIK_natsoc_split_the_separatists_desc:0 "A divided Central Asia is an easily controlled Central Asia. The larger and more unified these nations become, the greater the threat they pose Russia. Therefore we should strive to keep these nations as divided and unstable as possible. Our intelligence advisors suggest it wouldn't be too difficult to play these countries off one another, sparking border conflicts and wars to weaken their overall strength and stability. Our men already have underground supply lines funneling weapons into these countries, and should unification become inevitable, we can be assured it will be a leftist, Ordosocialist aligned nation that succeeds."
 NIK_natsoc_a_mission_abroad_desc:0 "The Middle East is a powder keg, not unlike the Balkans. There are dozens if not hundreds of insurgency and liberation movements in the area, and the already unstable nature of the region will make it easy to infiltrate, manipulate, and further destabilize. Our men have already made contact with Ba'athist liberation movements across the region, as well as Kurdish separatists specifically in northern Iraq and southern Turkey. Disrupting Middle Eastern politics and pushing it further towards civil war and unrest shouldn't give us too much difficulty."
 NIK_natsoc_of_darkest_africa_desc:0 "Of all the lands and peoples on this Earth, none have been more so oppressed and humiliated than those in Africa. Whether it be Northern Africa today under the facist boot of Italy and Iberia or Sub-Saharan Africa which has been under the imperialist, colonialist boot of Europe's various empires for hundreds of years, these people have known naught but pain and suffering. Surely among them there are men and women who would fight for their freedom and independence. Our agents in Africa have told us that there are, and that all we need to do is provide the means for them to do so. These colonies, these bastions of superpower imperialism, cannot be tolerated any longer."

Eurasia is the descendant of a thousand ethnicities and cultures, all caught up in a geographic web that drew close and bound them together.

So it is with our nation.\n\nThe Bolsheviks failed to properly respect the diverse races of our superethnos. They established the ASSRs not to represent ethnic groups, but to appease their naive workers and ideologues with false promises of self-determination.

We should begin a colonial drive to bring people out to these disparate lands so as to make a life for themselves.\n\nAnyone who moves out to these territories will be given their own lands to farm on, free of charge.

After the invasion and subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, many of them found themselves across Russia as they fled the west.

Bolsheviks and liberals think them 'indispensable' to Russia, and they constantly seek to ingratiate themselves - offering a hand open in friendship with the other concealing a knife behind their back. They have propagated amongst the pure race for so long that they often seem indistinguishable from us. A lesser man might despair at this situation, but not the Regent - for God Himself speaks to him, and has revealed the truth: that no innocent life lost in the pursuit of purity will be in vain. Facing uncertainty, kill them all - God will know His own."
 NIK_taboritsky_the_war_within_desc:0 "Treason is like a tree. Its leaves, green and filled with life, wave gently in the wind and paint an idyllic picture, while beneath the soil its roots spread like a plague and corrupt all they touch. Even the most pure of Russians is not immune to its vile infection, it seems...\n\nThey gather in their homes, in the streets, in churches. They blaspheme against the Blessed Regent, decrying him as - one can scarcely believe it - a tyrant and a heretic! Even our own holy men have been subverted by the Jewry, condemning His Eminence as a new Antiochus Epiphanes! We know not how our own people could be led astray so easily, but this Jewish devilry must be excised at once!"
 NIK_taboritsky_the_false_shepherds_desc:0 ""Woe to you, Pharisees, because you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and salutations in the marketplace." Thus spake the Lord. Would that we had heeded his words! Would that the clergy had but a single neck, so that we might strangle it!\n\nThe priests, the nuns, the monks - they have not been so loyal as they dared profess. Their hearts are full of treason, heresy and sympathy for the Jew. We should have known the depths of their evil when they first balked at our cleansing of Holy Russia. What is the price of a priest? How many silver shekels does it cost to turn a holy man against God Himself? We'll set this matter right, no matter how much clerical blood we have to spill to free ourselves from Satanic corruption!"
 NIK_taboritsky_rats_in_the_walls_desc:0 "Comparisons to cockroaches are most apt to describe subhumans, considering recent news! We have learned that the Shturmoviki are not quite so capable as their commanders claimed - countless thousands of Jews, degenerates, traitors and other vermin have escaped them! Worse still, they have been protected by our own supposedly loyal brothers of the pure race!\n\nIt defies belief that the Regent's own people - God's chosen race! - are so thoroughly corrupted. Is this, too, the doing of Lucifer? What other explanation could there be? The Regent is incapable of error! Whatever the reason, we must meet this challenge with sword in hand! Execute the lying Shturmoviki, redouble our efforts and mete out swift, deadly justice to every Jew-sympathizer we find!"
 NIK_taboritsky_the_purity_order_desc:0 "The Church can never again be trusted. Even bishops and grandmasters were turned to treason by Jewish gold and Satan's promises of power. There is only one solution: to turn back the clock, to demolish the rotten structure, to burn it all down.\n\nThe Blessed Regent will be as a new Saint Peter - the rock upon which a new, pure church is built. The first step in this process is to ensure the loyalty of our holy men, so that there is no need for another great purge. All that is needed for this is a few good men, drawn from the most loyal of the Shturmoviki. This 'Purity Order' will carry out inspections, provide guidance to local priests and enforce mandatory church attendance. The true faith is not yet lost!"
 NIK_taboritsky_no_such_thing_as_innocence_desc:0 "Among the Regent's blessings is a fraction of the Lord's omniscience. He knows the hearts of men and imparts this knowledge to his chosen servants. Nobody brought before the Imperial Courts is free of sin; they are wreathed in treachery, heresy flowing in their blood.\n\nA plea of innocence in our courts is therefore guilty of wasting our time, along with whatever other offenses the defendant has committed. There is no need for 'due process' when our judicial system is directly guided by God Himself."
 NIK_taboritsky_villages_of_the_damned_desc:0 "The traditional hierarchy of the Apostolic Church has been tested and found wanting. The bishops who professed loyalty to the Blessed Regent were traitors to a man, secretly working to hollow out the foundations of our reborn empire. The serpentine spirit of Satan lurks in their hearts. There is only one possible cure for such wickedness.\n\nTo fill the void left by our righteous cleansing, we shall have to elevate new, pure-hearted men in the bishops' stead. With the Church so thoroughly corrupted, we cannot trust any man of the cloth, no matter how lowly. Only the Regent's hand-picked subjects are worthy of bearing the responsibility of shepherding the Lord's flock. His word is God's word, and God knows what is best for His church."
 NIK_taboritsky_the_wages_of_sin_desc:0 "Romans 6:23 - "For the wages of sin is death."\n\nWe tire of mercy. We tire of traitors going free because their crimes were judged to be insignificant by a soft-spined judge. We tire of our soldiers who, with faintness gripping their hearts, refuse to bring down the executioner's blade on a Jewish neck. We tire of the doubters, dissenters and rabble-rousers in our own inner circle, who whisper of treachery and deviancy behind our back. Yet still they demand it of us, the Devil citing scripture to his purpose.\n\nDeath is a mercy."
 NIK_taboritsky_empire_eternal_desc:0 "Holy Russia is the true Kingdom of God on Earth. We are utterly unassailable, preserved by the blessing of the Lord. Even the Israel of old pales before our glory!\n\nThere is nothing wrought by man that can threaten us. No weapon can strike us down, no illness can take our Regent, no obstacle can impede our quest to find the Tsarevich. He lives! We live! Holy Russia lives, as it always has and always will, the only pure nation upon this benighted earth!"

 NIK_taboritsky_the_arsenal_of_damocles_desc:0 "Western Siberia and its vast, heaven-sent resources have finally been annexed into the Regency's demesne. This is cause for celebration, for now we have all that we need to advance our special weapons program to the next stage of development.\n\nOur enemies had their own biological weapons programs. Better yet, we have facilities to make use of their designs in the now-liberated Judeo-plutocratic state of Zlatoust. There, new instruments of death will be forged with which to scour the lands of evil."
 NIK_taboritsky_new_concoctions_desc:0 "Phosgene, mustard gas and sarin are all capable and useful tools in our arsenal. With these ingenious chemical weapons, entire cities have been subdued and thousands of noisome parasites exterminated.\n\nThe Regent believes that yet more deadly secrets remain to be discovered, and has ordered our chemists and engineers to begin experimentation at once. There are ample supplies of materials at hand, and plenty of learned men who could be pressed into service..."
 NIK_taboritsky_no_lives_wasted_desc:0 "Not all slaves are useful workers. There are plenty who refuse to take up their tools, make a habit of trying to escape or simply lack the strength to survive hard labor. The usual solution to these problematic individuals is a bullet to the back of the head, but the Regent has devised a brilliant alternative.\n\nAny scientific endeavour requires test subjects. We hear that in degenerate nations like America, small rodents are preferred. Their scientists are weak, feeble - ours recognize that a very specific kind of rat makes for far more interesting and reliable subjects."
 NIK_taboritsky_the_spark_desc:0 "Recently, we have become enlightened to the existence in our territory of a particular element that has deeply intrigued the Regent. Uranium, a relatively abundant radioactive material that serves as the basis for that which previously lay beyond our reach: nuclear power.\n\nThe Regent is positively giddy with excitement, as are all his most loyal subjects. He has directed large numbers of slaves and all requisite equipment to Omsk, where the largest deposits have been found. Today, we take the first step towards our acquisition of the ultimate weapon."
 NIK_taboritsky_recover_lost_knowledge_desc:0 "It is said that the Bolsheviks, probably following the urging of their genocidal Jewish overlords, were experimenting with nuclear power before the German invasion. We should thank God that neither they nor the profligate West attained such power before Germany did! As a result of the Soviet collapse, the scientists involved in the nuclear program scattered to the winds - and some have been found hiding amongst the Regent's own subjects.\n\nTheir knowledge will be at our disposal, one way or the other. Scientists are frail, feeble men without the will to endure interrogation. If they will not work for us, we can at least extract the information we need to educate their more loyal colleagues."
 NIK_taboritsky_skyward_swords_desc:0 "To deliver divine punishment from long range is a beautiful thing. The Germans, Japanese and Americans all possess the capacity to destroy one another in an instant. They each have an arsenal of nuclear missiles, which combined could raze entire continents in a storm of atomic fire. Despite protestations to the contrary, they probably also have similar systems for the delivery of chemical and biological agents.\n\nOur own rocketry program shall be made a priority. With the right funding and resources, we can build an arsenal that will allow us to engulf entire nations in clouds of billowing, toxic death."
 NIK_taboritsky_sacrificial_lambs_desc:0 "Testing chemical weapons in a laboratory is simple. With the press of a button, one can immediately see the effects on a human body. Adjustments can be made on the fly, without any of the difficulties involved in testing something like a rocket. For that, we require suitable targets - and, of course, our own subjects are not suitable for this purpose.\n\nThankfully, just over the southern border of our realm, there is a land filled with nothing but degenerate barbarians. Their crude villages dotted along the frontier are oblivious to our might and far from anyone who might protect them. Surely, we speak for everyone when we ask: who will miss them?"
 NIK_taboritsky_heavens_light_desc:0 "God favors us - he has granted unto us the knowledge with which we can build our very own Sword of Damocles. We have begun along the path leading to that which the Blessed Regent has sought for so long: a weapon to surpass all others.\n\nWhen Tsarevich Alexei assumes the throne, his rule will be unassailable by mortal men. Any threat to his sacred demesne will be met with an unrelenting nuclear firestorm the likes of which none could ever hope to match! Never again - not from now until the end of time - will Bolsheviks, Jews, subhumans or traitors ever threaten the Holy Russian Empire! God wills it!"

 NIK_shafarevich_the_great_uniter_desc:0 "Every century or so the Russian nation produces a political genius - at even rarer intervals than that, Russia births a unifier, a leader who can embody and guard the values of the Motherland at its time of greatest need. For every Time of Troubles, an Ivan the Great: for every Napoleon, a Catherine. The time of the Unifier is again at hand, and its harbinger is Igor Shafarevich.\n\nShafarevich will build his nation neither on the false pietisms of the Fascists nor the moral degradation of the Leftists - Russia will be shaped by what has always made it great, the purity of its soil and the refined disposition of its people. Only a Moral Russia can be a strong Russia, and only a strong Russia can be great. We will find the will to cast those parasites who impede us in this mission, and God help us, when freedom shines once more upon the Rodina it will be a true and lasting one."
 NIK_shafarevich_national_democracy_desc:0 " We are the Party of the Masses, but if we do not uphold the voice of the Russian people we are no better than the petty tyrants who claimed the same title. We will fashion from this rough clay a new and lasting Democracy, one that encompasses the breadth of our domain and its peoples - and, as with every careful potter, we will take care to dispose of any excess or spoiled materials before our work is complete.\n\nWe will institute new democratic campaigns across the rural network, calling for mass political participation and voting rallies, but our bureaucracy will take the greatest of pains to ensure that external elements - the old enemies of Russia - will not infiltrate this expression of our greatest values. Glory to Russia! May our freedom stand forever untainted!"
 NIK_shafarevich_election_security_act_desc:0 "There is something to be said about our dedication to rural democracy - there is also something to be said about the vulnerability of said democracy to infiltration by... unsavory elements. Words, however, are easy. We must set our minds to action, and preserve the voice of the Rodina in its most honest and direct form - rooting out every stray voice that does not truly have the Motherland at heart!\n\nThe Security Act being drafted will go a long way towards our goals in both directions. Formal agencies will be directed to reorganize our election structure from the bottom up, accountable to the highest legislative bodies in the land, and for those who are deemed suspicious in background, well, democracy is a vital and fragile instrument, yes? We cannot afford to take chances."
 NIK_shafarevich_the_spiritual_hegemony_desc:0 "Long have we dealt with the people of the Western Siberian despotates, and long have we awaited their return to the fold. Shafarevich is convinced that an approach of generosity and benevolence is what will work best for the good of the Nation as a whole; at all possible times we will forestall the use of violence and attempt instead to reinforce our common interests. There is much to be gained by accepting our rulership, and at the end of the day we are all Russians.\n\nHowever, should they refuse...§Rspecial measures§! will have to be taken to make these wayward children see sense."
 NIK_shafarevich_a_generation_of_thinkers_desc:0 "Russia is a field. This field is watered infrequently, and occasionally parts of it burn down at the behest of others, but the result is a stronger and more beautiful harvest. This is also true for Russia's vast landscape of intellectual talent - for every difficulty the peasantry have faced, they have overcome with flying colors. This, then, is our goal: to find the strongest and best flowers in our garden, nurture them into brilliant life, and set them loose to transform the world around them.\n\nWe will overhaul our recruitment structure in both Party and Government, setting the absolute highest standards of education and training, and when we are done our nation will be led by the cream of the Russian crop. The beautiful, the brave, the sensitive and the strong - they say the Superman will emerge from Berlin, but our rebuttal will be crafted here in Russia."
 NIK_shafarevich_the_most_loyal_opposition_desc:0 "The Russian spirit is renowned for its boundless enthusiasm, and for its absolute integrity. Long have these impulses served us, and long have they sown fertile rewards in artistic and scientific innovation. But there are instances in which one clashes with the other - so too for our opposition, noble in their enthusiasm but with their integrity tilted askew. It falls to us to ensure that they are curbed in the worst of their excesses, so that we will have a firm and unquestioned hand in guiding this country to the common good.\n\nWe will, through quiet words and unquiet actions, move our Opposition into positions of ceremonial power and no real value, while we place pressure upon their leadership to follow the will of the Russian state (its voice being, of course, Shafarevich). The Opposition may not always agree with us, but with our gentle directions, we will ensure that they will follow our lead even in wilfulness."
 NIK_shafarevich_return_to_the_soil_desc:0 "So much has been made of our dedication to rural democracy - perhaps we have forgotten that the farmer thinks of voting only as an afterthought. His life is dominated by simpler, rougher and better things - the harvest, the village and the family. As we polish our democratic processes, cast out the problematic elements haunting us and open the ballot boxes, let us celebrate as if there were neither peasant nor workingman, only Russians!\n\nThe Russian Spirit will be fostered as we turn electoral cycles into literal cycles of life, akin to harvests - rural-cultural dancing, movie screenings, and outright celebrations of life will follow each ballot, and our Churches will fill with joy as priests speak of the noble perfection of the Russian life. It will be a life of beauty and of honest work - all of Russia will share in its joy!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_national_self_sufficiency_desc:0 "In the time of the Tsars Russia was accused of rapaciousness, even robbery, in its treatment of the nations under its wing. It was said that the Government favoured the death of ten indigenous residents to the impoverishment of a single Russian. Those days are long gone now, and the Empire is a fading memory, but the problem the Tsars faced has been handed over to us. What approach shall we take to preserve our national essence, while remaining faithful stewards of the people God has granted us dominion over?\n\nShafarevich believes he has the solution: an approach he calls Self-Sufficiency, wherein the non-Russian national communities shall see neither incorporation nor exploitation. Instead the Russian nation shall focus on enriching its people, and the minorities within it can go their own way - they will be blessedly, truly free of the hands of the State, now and forever."
 NIK_shafarevich_bond_the_countryside_desc:0 "We must never forget the rural roots of Russian life, and to abandon them to the ravages of industrial monstrosity would be utterly immoral of us. Instead we will focus on the true aims of any government worth its salt - allowing the fertile soil of Russian peasantry to take root and blossom into fecundity.\n\nOf course, that does not mean the state is entirely irrelevant: far from it, our new Russian Agrarianism policies will ensure that the state will forever be joined at the hip to the farmer! From investment in rural production methods to the sending of agricultural advisors, from bureaus to tractors to roads, the Russian State will experience rebirth where it was born at the first."
 NIK_shafarevich_farewell_to_arcadia_desc:0 "We do not make this decision lightly - it is with the bitterest of regrets - but for the Rodina to rebuild some compromises must be made, no matter the cost. Just as trees survive better with the cutting of branches when the forest fires come, so too shall Russia's industrial abominations, expansive though they might be, save us from the inferno of war.\n\nWe will invest in industrial and heavy-mining concerns in areas that are sparsely populated, boosting our private industry at the cost of some of our cultural purity. It might be a betrayal of our values. It might even be considered oppressive. With our diplomatic threats coming closer every day, however, this investment will come in handy sooner or later. We would prefer to wield it of our own volition, rather than have it foisted upon us."
 NIK_shafarevich_russias_beating_heart_desc:0 "As the firms, the farmers and the factories of the Motherland grow into each other, the Nation comes closer to the platonic ideal of a united series of tissues. Yes, Russia is one giant organ of life and common purpose, and what a glorious shared purpose it is! We must not rest easy, however: the people must always be guarded from their worst impulses, not to mention those germs who would wish to defile what we have built here and turn it to their own ends.\n\nContinual incremental adjustments to this system, developing new methods to manage Russian ruralities and building a strong culture of self-reliance amongst our peasantry will ensure that this self-sustaining system continues to grow and self-correct. May all of Russia embrace this organic life, and may it sustain a vital Nation far into the future!"
 NIK_shafarevich_promote_russian_traditions_desc:0 "In the lands under our hegemony, many mansions claim dominion over the Russian heart. Some of them are of Socialist origin, some of Monarchist roots, and some stem from foreign influences. There will be more in the days to come, but if we are to expel these wayward ideas we must build something of substance in its place. The Russian Glory must be on full display for its light to enlighten our people! Nothing less is acceptable!\n\nWe will focus on the development of the rituals that tie us to the soil, and to the Nation: national holidays are only the beginning of a full-scale revamp of our civic culture. Religious occasions, national commemorations of martyrs and the enforcement of Russian language and history will ensure that the light of the Rus shines far brighter than the darkness which would put it out!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_counter_russophobic_campaign_desc:0 "In recent days some have spoken of those with a sinister vision for Russia - they speak of the demon of "multiculturalism", where tolerance of those different from us is is interchangeable from the blending of pure Russian culture with incompatible, alien substances! It is utter nonsense to believe such things, of course, but the nonsense is potent nonetheless. If we are to combat this stupidity we must start from the ground of Russian society - the peasantry.\n\nIn truth, many Russian ruralities have an unrealised, nebulous notion of what it means to be Russian. By affirming their God-given sense of what is Russian and what is from the Devil, we will reinforce the notion that a half-hearted embrace of minority culture, of the loss of the heritage of earth and blood, is Russophobia in its most demonic form. And when we set these people loose upon the cities, we hope the ivory-tower elites who speak above their station will learn that lesson, too."
 NIK_shafarevich_the_politically_conscious_army_desc:0 "Glory is in the Russian blood - our people were made for greatness, and the Army is the distillation of the finest traditions of our people. Honor! Courage! Integrity! Patriotism! These values thrive everywhere, but they blossom into view only in the men who have selflessly volunteered for the greatest of all possible lives. What better way to ensure the spirit of our National Revival never dies out than to build it into the Army?\n\nRegular political re-education lessons, the stacking of leadership positions with firm loyalists dedicated to the Passionaryy ideals, and an emphasis on rural strength will keep the Army forever loyal to our ideals and our vision for the nation. Quiet amendments to the Constitution will also ensure that should our leadership ever come into question, the soldiers know exactly where their interests lie."
 NIK_shafarevich_from_sea_to_shining_sea_desc:0 "This, then, is the dream: nothing more, nothing less than the bringing to wholeness of Holy Russia. Even as the Union fell, even as the barbarities consumed so much of Russian life and culture, we held on to this dream. The time has come when we shall bring it into being - so with our Army ready to roll the false-kulturny ideas that pollute Russia all the way back to Germania, let us be fearless!\n\nThere is a home for us, a place where the people most precious of God shall ever rest: that place is the heart of the Father in heaven, and the Holy Mother Rus on earth!"
 NIK_shafarevich_the_russian_idea_desc:0 "Again and again, civilization has risen, again and again it has collapsed, and again and again, Russia has taken its remnants into our loving arms. When Orthodoxy burned with Constantinople, we took the mantle of the new Rome without question. When the liberalists burnt Europe half to the ground, we in Russia took the mantle of tradition. Now that the Germanic savages hold Russian soil and people hostage, we shall again assume the mantle of those who know they are the last redoubt - for that is what we are.\n\nBut let us never cower before the enemy! Our long march to the Baltics, to the Urals, has brought with it the Russian Idea - the vitality and the beauty and the wild strength of Russian life - everywhere our boots have landed. Again I tell you: as long as we hold the Rodina within our hearts, in our minds and with every harvest, Russia can never fall! We are unconquered, unconquerable, and in the long war with savagery, there has been one certain truth:\n\n§RWe have won every single time. We will win this time, too.§!"

 NIK_bukharina_the_path_to_liberation_desc:0 "Despite the odds, we have managed to liberate West Russia and West Siberia! Our people cheer in the streets, for they know that freedom and prosperity is at hand. While we will undoubtedly have to work to ensure that West Siberia is fully integrated into our government, it seems that the sun shines on Bukharina's ideals. We must not falter now, for we must continue onwards towards utopia!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_triumphant_reforms_desc:0 "While we were able to enact some reforms after the unification of West Russia, there was still much doubt about Bukharina as a leader that prevented her from enacting the full breadth of her plans. With the successful reclamation of West Siberia, many of the doubts about Bukharina have been swept away, allowing her to push onwards. The time has come to begin enacting further reforms to push the people closer into a truly socialist society. These reforms will include ensuring equality for all, investigating the necessity of the familial unit, and ensuring that traditionalism's influence in society is greatly weakened. We shall ensure that the Soviet Union is a utopia for all!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_value_of_equality_desc:0 "Any socialist will talk about equality. Question them, and they shall go on about the equality of man to woman, of Russian to Indian, and so on. However, what is much rarer is the socialist that backs up said values with actions. All too common is the socialist who will state their belief in gender equality, just to turn around and deprive women of their rights. We must break this cycle by not only espousing the values of equality, but by supporting those who have been wronged by traditionalist culture. No longer will women have to languish because they are supposedly inferior, and no longer will ethnic minorities have to suffer from racism here in Russia!"
 NIK_bukharina_introduce_the_creches_desc:0 "Family is a complex issue. While familial ties have always been the core of society, the fact remains that many bad traditions and inequalities are passed down through them. In order to rectify this, we have begun an experimental program in which children will be raised communally. This communal raising, called creches, will be the forefront of the experiments on if phasing out contemporary families is possible and feasible. We will keep this program opt-in and small for now, as we are not sure if the creche system is superior to the family system. Socialism is about moving forward, in the end, if the creches succeed, we will be able to move forward from the outdated system of families!"
 NIK_bukharina_a_place_for_the_family_desc:0 "While the family may have its issues, dissolving the family is more trouble than it's worth, as the cohesion and support it provides to a society is unmatched by communal child-raising. The better option is to promote egalitarian relations within a family. The wife does not have to stay at home, as she has every right to go to work. Furthermore, children, as they grow into adults, are not obligated to listen to the every command of their parents. By promoting egalitarian ideals within the family, we can hopefully break the traditionalist cycles nestled within, allowing for the revolutionary potential of a family to truly shine through."
 NIK_bukharina_strike_down_traditionalism_desc:0 "In the chaos of the Russian anarchy, the people turned to traditionalism and religion. Now that we have ended warlordism in the west, we have to show the people the trappings of said traditionalism. It may seem beneficial to stick to the ancient truths, but it is those very truths that stagnate society. We shall use the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation in order to help uplift the people to a modern socialist ideal!"
 NIK_bukharina_encourage_experimentalism_desc:0 "We must encourage experimentalist art amongst our people. For far too long, artists have stuck to the old ways because they are old. While the classics of art may be beautiful, they are not the only way to acquire beauty in art. It is time for the people to broaden their horizons so that they are not bound by the chains of conservative antiquity!"
 NIK_bukharina_foundations_of_the_peoples_society_desc:0 "It seems that our social reforms have begun to bear fruit. More and more, people treat others with respect, as compared to the contempt they would have before. However, just because our reforms are working, doesn't mean we can merely stop now. We must always keep moving forward so that we can create an ideal socialist society!"
 NIK_bukharina_making_the_peace_desc:0 "While we have stamped out most organized resistance to our rule, there are still rabble rousers who seek to revolt against our regime and undo our social reforms. We must task the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation to preserve the order, and ensure that we do not become unstable!"
 NIK_bukharina_continue_land_expropriation_desc:0 "A surprising problem we have run into during our consolidation of West Siberia is the issue of land. Many peasants own a pittance of land at best, while landlords are worryingly common. We must rectify this by distributing all land in West Siberia so that the people have the land they need in order to survive and prosper!"
 NIK_bukharina_the_universal_soviet_desc:0 "We are all human, in the end. We are all workers, and peasants, and people. There is a certain unity, no matter how much the capitalist says otherwise, that exists between us all. We must show the people the idea of the universal Soviet, that we all work towards a common goal in one grand union!"
 NIK_bukharina_eyes_on_the_unproven_desc:0 "The various governments of West Siberia have not exactly been pro-socialist. Knowing this, and the conclusion that the people have been inoculated against socialism, we must step up our surveillance efforts against the people of West Siberia to prevent them from revolting against us."
 NIK_bukharina_trust_the_peoples_goodwill_desc:0 "The people are not their government. Even if the government was reactionary, the people may very well not be the same. We have to ensure that we accept the people of West Siberia, as opposed to treating them with suspicion. After all, it is trust that helps build a better government."
 NIK_bukharina_the_benevolent_state_desc:0 "More than anything, the state is a critical part of socialist society. It helps provide for the people, and ensure that the freedoms and socialist ideals of the people are upheld.

 NIK_zhdanov_the_march_of_revolutionary_progress_desc:0 "For years we have struggled under the reign of the counterrevolutionary and the Luddite, who find comfort in the darkness of ignorance. Yet now, years after Russia's collapse into a dark age of ignorance, we stand upon the brink of a brave new era, marching onwards into the light! No more shall the reactionaries keep us chained to infighting and petty warlordism! We shall craft a new Russia from the ashes of the old, ascending to achieve the Soviet superculture!\n\nThe antiquated democracies and dictatorships shall melt away before the grandeur of ultravisionary socialism, the only true path forward for our nation and our species. First, however, we must prepare for the push to retake Siberia from the regressives who claim to be the rightful leaders of Russia."
 NIK_zhdanov_unity_in_purpose_desc:0 "It will be many years before the Paramount Leader's ultimate vision of a spacefaring multispecies collective is fulfilled, but we are closer than ever to that goal. However, before we take our rightful place amongst the stars, we must first deal with earthly matters. Great swathes of our territory are still controlled by a rival government, preventing the industrialization we need to fund our future and denying those under their rule to participate in the grand collective we are assembling.\n\nBut even worse, the Germans have returned their stolen lands to a state of regressive oppression, forcing the people of Moskowien into a stagnant and repressive hierarchy. We must put an end to their misdeeds and incorporate the peoples of that territory into the supertculture, and to do that, we must restore our control of Siberia's resources."
 NIK_zhdanov_unity_in_ideology_desc:0 "To succeed in our goals, Russia must be totally united, not just in geography, but aligned on the principles of the new Soviet state. Achievement of the superculture requires a complete alignment of the citizenry on all fronts, so that we might transcend our earthly bonds. To facilitate the process of cultural conversion we have prepared a new version of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia in line with the principles outlined by the Paramount Leader, to elucidate the values of ultravisionary socialism. This will ensure that every citizen is mentally prepared for the creation of an intersolar nation."
 NIK_zhdanov_assess_the_reclaimed_territories_desc:0 "We are under no illusions about the difficulties inherent in our venture to create a unifying superculture from the disparate masses of humanity. Still, against all odds we have subsumed millions of individuals into our collective, and now possess a great deal of new territory along with all the resources that come with it.\n\nAbove all, the oil fields we have captured will provide us with power, fuel, and funding for our projects. Our tractors, tanks, and soon our rockets shall run on this black gold, propelling our expansion into the lost territories to the east. The remainder shall be sold to fund our scientific projects, serving the interests of the Soviet people. An administrative committee will be created to evaluate the qualities and uses of this and other resources, and ensure maximum efficiency of our efforts."
 NIK_zhdanov_absorb_the_sverdlovsk_design_bureau_desc:0 "The Sverdlovsk Design Bureau was one of the most effective scientific installations in Western Siberia, established under the purview of Konstantin Rokossovsky, a talented general who was sadly unsuited to the demands of the superculture. However, his creation is responsible for many breakthroughs in the art of modern warfare and the technology needed for it.\n\nA more effective fighting force will be necessary to consolidate the bountiful resources of Russia for our own purposes, and the Sverdlovsk Bureau must be consolidated into the greater structure for the benefit of all."
 NIK_zhdanov_rehabilitate_the_personnel_desc:0 "Scientific minds are not just highly educated and useful, the men who possess them are highly advanced thinkers and the best suited to lead in the days ahead. Most men do not adapt quickly to the new demands of the day, and our leaders must do it most of all. These men must be fellow architects of the superculture, each doing his part to make humanity transcend its limitations and build a brave new world.\n\nWe have recently acquired several scientists from Sverdlovsk whose experience in military applications of sciences will make fine additions to the collective. Prepare to rehabilitate them as ultravisonary leaders. With their expertise, we shall touch the stars."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_ultravisionary_method_desc:0 "The Paramount Leader, and the future of humanity, stands before a critical decision.\n\nWill we seek to establish ourselves as the dominant terrestrial power, eliminating the regressives of Germania and freeing millions of workers to participate in the establishment of our new superculture? Or will we secure our ascendancy by developing technology that would have been unthinkable only mere decades ago, and boldly transgressing the most optimistic expectations of the reactionaries and even our own scientists?\n\nThis choice will determine the distribution of our resources for years to come. In our unification, there can be no half-measures."
 NIK_zhdanov_applied_zhdanovshchina_desc:0 "Ultravisionary socialism must establish itself as the dominant and undisputed power upon this terrestrial body before presenting itself to extraterrestrial beings as a superior mode of society. The superculture cannot be challenged by external forces, especially not in a critical moment of first contact with an unknown civilization. It would drastically reduce our credibility to introduce ourselves as merely another of the powers of our divided world.\n\nAs such, we must prepare operations to weaken those who would see us dragged back into the cave of ignorance, secure all the resources we can from them, and manufacture circumstances so as to achieve dominance over the world. As long as the superculture remains vulnerable to Earth-bound influences, stellar adventures will have to wait."
 NIK_zhdanov_the_way_for_humanity_is_open_desc:0 "Why should a titan meddle with the ants beneath their notice? Germany is divided and weak, a tottering tower on the brink of collapse. Japan is much the same. The West is embroiled in their usual capitalist squabbles. We are above all this petty bickering. The creation and expansion of the superculture should be our concern, above all else.\n\nThis decision will of course have consequences, consequences which are inescapable. Reallocation of our resources to expanding the new frontier will require sacrifices from the Soviet people for the benefit of the whole, as is outlined in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia.\n\nThe obsolete governments of the West are bound to the Earth. We are bound for the stars."
 NIK_zhdanov_necessary_material_conditions_desc:0 "The German invasion has set back our progress by an unacceptable degree, and one of the greatest weaknesses of our new Russia is the living conditions of its people. Infrastructure has been broken apart, cutting our citizens off from networks of guidance created by cities. Farms have been burned and salted, reducing our population's ability to fulfill the most basic of human needs.\n\nThis is an unacceptable state for the Soviet superculture to be in. The individual units of the collective must be functional for it to function at full capacity, and so we must uplift the lowest among us before we can uplift humanity. The broken links between dissolute portions of humanity must be repaired on a physical and psychological level, and we shall never allow ourselves to be divided again!"
 NIK_zhdanov_observe_cultural_shifts_desc:0 "It is not enough to shape and mold the superculture. The sculptor must monitor his clay, particularly when he works with such materials as the human race, and ensure it is formed and fired properly. Conformity to the principles of the Paramount Leader is to be encouraged, while deviation is to be corrected. Active deviation is to be forcefully corrected.\n\nTo this end, we shall deploy trained architects of the superculture, to monitor every facet of life for the collection of data, obtain feedback on the efficacy of our methods, and detect regressives within our ranks for prompt reeducation. Those who would disrupt the Paramount Leader's plans disrupt the progress of mankind, and shall not be tolerated in any form."
 NIK_zhdanov_society_redefined_desc:0 "From such small beginnings, we have come so far. With the majority of our enemies defeated, the undisputed control of our lands has been solidified. Our fighting forces grow strong on the back of scientific discovery and innovation. Literature and language is putty in our hands, shaped to our benefit. Our brightest minds construct rockets and discuss the spread of socialism across borders, and between the stars.\n\nAnd beyond the stars, our destiny awaits, to show the universe the power of ultravisionary socialism. We shall complete Phase One of Comrade Kardashev's plan for civilization, achieving mastery over our planet, and prove ourselves the heralds of mankind's ascension!\n\nThe superculture shall unite as one, and as one, we go forth."
 NIK_zhdanov_glory_to_the_ones_who_look_forward_desc:0 "The banner of Lenin is over us\nWe've come to build happiness!\nWith the young hands,\nwe write the biography of the Earth!\n\nGlory to the ones who look forward!\nGlory to the ones who march forward!\nOur path is from the present to the stellar future!\nOur path is from the present to the coming years!\n\nYouth like a stellar rocket,\nascends upward every day!\nWe will light clear dawns\nAbove the Motherland!"

 NIK_a_grand_step_forwards_desc:0 "The reborn Soviet Union grows yet stronger, driven onwards by the inexorable currents of history. No amount of fascist violence or particularist deviance can prevent the restoration of the true workers' state. Western Siberia, with its population, industrial hubs and rich agricultural land, is restored to the rightful government of the proletariat. Half of the Motherland is now liberated; we shall begin the process of reintegration and cleaning up the mess that our enemies have made immediately."
 NIK_extend_the_apparatus_desc:0 "Siberia has been deprived of proper socialist governance for too long. The reactionary juntas, criminals and revisionists have left us with a sorry assortment of ineffective bureaucracies and backwards local administrations. This will not do. The people demand that their Siberian brothers and sisters are granted the full benefits of our renewed socialist society - Comrade Suslov shall see that it is done! Soon, cities and villages alike will be filled with smiling workers and peasants, cheering on the advance of the revolution as it reclaims all of Russia."
 NIK_supervise_the_union_desc:0 "Siberia is not as refined and orderly as it should be. Crime, banditry and rebellion continue to blight the land. Such is the natural outcome of societal breakdown and the absence of a strong, ideologically consistent government. The workers demand order and security, and General Secretary Suslov will make it so. Police presence in the region will be increased tenfold. Of course, this will in turn require further expansion of our robust security apparatus - a small, harmless reform that the Party is more than happy to endorse. All Siberians shall rest easy under our constant vigilance."
 NIK_the_heart_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "The workers of the world are all equal, but those of Russia were the first to embrace the revolution in its true form and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat. Our comrades around the world have sadly forgotten this fact, owing to our defeat at the hands of fascism - but that was merely a temporary setback. The champion of international socialism is risen once more, strong as ever and buoyed aloft by the spirit of solidarity. Now that we are a global player again, we shall spread the good news to every corner of the Earth. Workers, rejoice - for the revolution has returned!"
 NIK_anti_corruption_initiatives_desc:0 "Sadly, despite our efforts to eventually become a post-money society, the allure of wealth remains a potent incentive towards criminal behavior. Corruption, that most capitalist of diseases, threatens to become common practice in our bureaucracy. This state of affairs is unacceptable, but conventional methods have proven ineffective against its spread. Perhaps it is time to fight fire with fire? The promise of financial reward to those willing to inform on corrupt colleagues might do more to curb the problem than any amount of investigations or tribunals."
 NIK_expunge_the_secret_societies_desc:0 "A twin-headed monster lurks, wounded but still alive, in the forests of Siberia. Upon its left shoulder rests the serpentine head of revisionism, hissing falsehoods with a forked tongue and leading workers astray. To its right sits the snarling visage of fascism, muzzle red with the peoples' blood. The beast is the double threat of the Stalinists and the Black League, equally guilty of crimes against socialism, the Motherland and her people. The remnants of these traitors must be expunged from Siberia to make way for sensible, humane socialism, that the wounds of the nation might be bound and healed."
 NIK_a_hand_to_the_khrushchevites_desc:0 "Even the splitters have splitters. The so-called Stalinists find themselves divided between those loyal to the chauvinist, reactionary Frankensteinian ideas of Kaganovich, and the more orthodox and progressive clique of Khrushchev. The latter still differ from our established Party line to a worrying degree, but perhaps we can return them to the correct path. Lenient, perhaps - but Khrushchev is a charismatic and popular man who commands great respect within the Party, especially from those with more forward-thinking tendencies."
 NIK_increase_socintern_funding_desc:0 "Russia is a fount of natural resources, giving us significant economic clout on the global stage. We can easily rake in billions from trade, and Comrade Suslov has exactly the right idea for where these righteous profits should be directed: the Socialist International. Failure to cooperate with the international proletariat has been the death of many a promising revolution, and we shall not repeat that mistake. The workers of the world will be united, and Soviet roubles will make it happen."
 NIK_repress_potential_deviants_desc:0 "The rise of another Bukharina or Zhdanov is a possibility we cannot abide. Despite their dedication to socialism, those two splitters frequently endangered the cause with selfish factionalism, setting a dangerous precedent for future generations. The Party cannot allow ideological deviance to become normalized. We must be on the lookout for any potential splitters rising through the ranks, that we might snuff out their ambitions and maintain socialism as Marx and Lenin intended it."
 NIK_accept_the_young_planners_desc:0 "Though many of the younger generation born after the time of Lenin and Bukharin tend towards unorthodox thought, they are not lost to us. They are like awkward teenagers getting a feel for their pubescent bodies, full of questions and confusion. On occasion, they glean some great insight amidst the chaos of change and become agents of socialism's future development. By vetting their ideas and encouraging growth rather than simply suppressing them outright, we can cultivate the next generation of great socialist thinkers. Someday, the current leaders of the proletariat will be gone; learned, intelligent and innovative successors will be needed to take their place."
 NIK_reform_party_membership_desc:0 "Membership of the Communist Party should mean something more than what it currently does. As-is, it seems that true believers are outnumbered by career bureaucrats seeking advancement. We are the vanguard of the socialist revolution, not a means by which ambitious men can put themselves above their comrades! Party membership should be accompanied with a set of obligations and standards to strengthen our legitimacy as the representatives of the proletariat. Those who fail to meet expectations will be expelled so that someone more deserving and reliable can take their place."
 NIK_emphasize_anti_imperialism_desc:0 "Make no mistake; the capitalist West is no friend to the proletariat. Even if fascism is the greater evil, it was capitalism's failings that led to its creation in the first place. That they now quarrel with one another is no concern to us. We know our path and will follow it; it shall never be a lonely one, for we have the workers of all nations by our side. We shall loudly and unequivocally condemn all imperialism, be it born of fascism or capitalism, for ultimately they differ only in their methods."
 NIK_a_strategic_orientation_desc:0 "We must face facts: the Soviet Union is not in a position to pick a fight with the West. They may be oppressive imperialists, but it was the Germans and their allies who invaded the Motherland and drove us from our homes. One does not look to the distant wolf when the bear is breaking down the door. Though the Americans can never be trusted so long as their corrupt kleptocratic institutions remain, aligning ourselves with the greater cause of defeating fascism is the responsible course of action."
 NIK_the_international_vanguard_desc:0 "Long have we waited for this day. There are those who said it would never come, that the revolution was finished; what have they to say now? The people and workers of the Soviet Union are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. Fascists, revisionists and reactionaries fall before us like wheat before the scythe! Nothing can defeat the courage and resolve of a united proletariat, mighty and invincible! Today, Siberia; tomorrow, the hills of Manchuria!"

 NIK_zhdanov_the_atomic_age_desc:0 "In the darkness of collapse, it seemed inevitable that we should never be restored to an equal footing with the nuclear powers. Yet in the end, only Russians could master Russia, and marshal her vast resources to any meaningful end. We shall split the atom and demonstrate to the world our overwhelming scientific prowess."
 NIK_zhdanov_uranium_extraction_efforts_desc:0 "Uranium is not an optional material in our nuclear experiments. Fortunately, our expansion into Western Siberia has granted us the resources we need. The mines around Omsk will give us what we need to begin our investments into the science of the atom."

We must take whole cities, devote them entirely to our scientific progress, and close them to all non-approved individuals. Security is paramount, and doubly so when dealing in nuclear secrets."
 NIK_zhdanov_absorb_compatible_elements_desc:0 "The old nuclear weapons program was started by Bukharin's regime, and while not devoted to the same ultravisionary principles as us, many of the scientists will be willing and able to participate in our own program. We should make every possible effort to entice them into our service. Our supremacy lies ahead!"
 NIK_zhdanov_the_rocket_equation_desc:0 "Our journey to the endless stars is impeded by the technical challenges of reaching orbit. Even the regressive Germans and decadent American capitalists have made it into space, and we must outstrip their successes with less time. Therefore, we must gather every aerospace academic and engineer we can, and spur the nation on to the ultimate goal of a space-faring civilization."
 NIK_zhdanov_poyekhali_desc:0 "The resources are marshalled, the design bureaus have been prepared, and our first rocket is well upon its way to being constructed. This will serve two valuable purposes. First, development of rocket technology will allow us to project power and ensure the primacy of the superculture with nuclear weapons. Second, the development of spaceflight technology shall bring us ever closer to the stars, and the ultimate progress of ultravisionary socialism."
 NIK_zhdanov_social_sphere_permeation_desc:0 "It is not enough to extol the values of the superculture as a concept. We must make sure that every citizen is made aware of our goals at an unconscious level, and that every aspect of our society is immersed in the values of ultravisionary socialism."
 NIK_zhdanov_a_socialist_superculture_desc:0 "From small beginnings in Syktyvkar, we have outmaneuvered our reactionary opponents and regressive allies at every turn. Russia was broken into pieces, and now, in the crucible of reunification, we shall forge a superculture to stand the test of time. None shall stand in the way of our ascendance- not the capitalist decadence of the west, nor the oppressive fascists of Germany, nor the atavistic banditry of the warlord years. United in our goals, we march forward in lockstep, to the destinations that only ultravisionaries can perceive.\n\nFor what is a single voice, compared to a magnificent chorus?"

 NIK_dsnp_socialism_for_the_people_desc:0 "Alexander Yakovlev is no stranger to ridicule - the majority of which, ironically, coming from those ostensibly most aligned with our policies. They accused us of some dreadful lacking for putting faith in the synthesis of Marx's theories and the market's temporary benefits.\n\nSerov believed we lack the vision to uplift Komi from its dilapidated state. Today Syktyvkar and its neighbor cities bustle with cars in the day and shine with electric lights at night.\n\nBukharina believed we lack the interest to provide for the people's needs. Today every worker and farmer in our payroll enjoys benefits that would foment jealousy in their counterparts outside Russia.\n\nSuslov believed we lack the strength to exert power over our immediate neighbors. Today the Free Republic's flag flies in every government building west of the Yenisei.\n\nThe conclusion is self-evident: we distinguish ourselves from naive fools by proving our naysayers wrong. As the Republic's generals and diplomats secure West Siberia for Russia's rightful government, their doubting voices have returned - the past years were strings of flukes, or so they claim. Surely Yakovlev can't enforce his wishful thinking onto another large swath of land and its peoples.\n\nFor the revolution's sake, we shall prove them wrong a fourth time."
 NIK_dsnp_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Yakovlev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with Syktyvkar's finest."
 NIK_dsnp_strengthen_the_social_economy_desc:0 "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 NIK_dsnp_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "Everyday, prospectors drill holes in the middle of nowhere (or rather, in the middle of West Siberia) and drench themselves in fountains of sticky black gold. Powering cars, factories and homes worldwide, Earth's ancient ichor is in high demand - and the Free Republic has fields worth ten hundred billion barrels of it underneath our feet. We would be fools not to exploit them for our benefit.\n\nThe National Assembly has hence approved a bill establishing Gazprom, a state-owned company that shall soon manage the particulars of exploiting quite possibly Earth's largest reserves of crude oil. Oil wells, pipelines, employees - whatever they need, we shall provide. The revenue they will generate will more than recompense our treasuries' losses a thousandfold."
 NIK_dsnp_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 NIK_dsnp_a_fruitful_reunification_desc:0 "With West Siberia's last warlord vanquished, the Free Republic now stretches from Gorky to the River Yenisei. It is tempting to make haste and immediately fulfill our preordained right to rule over all Russia, yet we must not stray from our primary mandate - that is, the betterment of the peoples whose lives we affect through the Assembly's laws.\n\nFor now, we shall expend much of the government's attention into integrating our new citizens into the liberties and comforts West Russia enjoys. Wanton conquest can wait until the Republic's citizens, old or new, live the fulfilling lives we have promised them."
 NIK_dsnp_staff_the_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Bureaucracy grows as the state does; should the latter grow twice its size overnight, then the former grows twice also. Both could be said for the Free Republic at present now that West Siberia is ours. Unfortunately, our sudden dearth of bureaucrats has led to issues in applying Syktyvkar's ordinances past the Ural Mountains.\n\nIn response, President Yakovlev has directed his advisors to recruit more bureaucrats not only from West Russia, but also from West Siberia. The pencil-pushers under our old adveraries' employ will be of great use to their new government soon."
 NIK_dsnp_answer_the_autonomy_question_desc:0 "Ethnic groups such as the Nenets and Selkups have inhabited northern Russia since before Yermak subjugated the Khanate of Sibir. Centuries of oppression under the Tsar followed, then decades under old Bukharin, until Barbarossa shattered the rusted grip that held their leashes. Pressing circumstances had up until now prevented us from doing more than granting autonomy to the enclaves that remain. Operative phrase: up until now.\n\nCertain members of the National Assembly have proposed legislation that, if passed, would turn the natives' autonomies into self-governing protectorates - independent nations in all but name. Whether or not it does pass will decide what place our Republic has for Russia's many non-Russians."
 NIK_dsnp_approaching_the_dawn_desc:0 "On the outskirts of Syktvkar, a farmer tests his new tractor in today's harvest. He reaped more wheat that day than in a month with his old sickle and trowel.\n\nIn Omsk, gray concrete bunkers explodingly give way to housing complexes with windows, curtains and balconies: features once dismissed for showing too much to enemies that can neither be seen nor grasped.\n\nIn Gorky, the morning air comes alive with searing heat, struck hammers and steelworkers' song. With the city fathers' leave, its sprawling assembly plants are now put to task building automobiles the common man can afford.\n\nSlowly but surely, leisurely but successfully - Russia steps out of perpetual dusk. We will feel sunlight's kiss again."
 NIK_dsnp_lessons_from_the_sibplan_desc:0 "History remembers Nikolai Bukharin as a man of many plans but scarce time. His vision for Russia and her proletariat died with Moscow during the Great Patriotic War, and so we can only speculate its specifics. Gosplan nevertheless gave some of it form in the days of NEP, namely Siberia's manmade transfiguration into an industrial powerhouse. The hence-named Siberia Plan's aftereffects lay in the winding railroads and teeming industrial zones dotting the region's halves.\n\nMuch of the megaproject's documents - blueprints, manifests, progress reports - has survived the Warlord Era's complications. We would do the Republic's economy today and tomorrow well by applying their lessons in raw material-rich yet industrially-poor regions like the Kazan."
 NIK_dsnp_ensure_industrial_equality_desc:0 "While specializing regions by the resources they possess does maximize their use to the national economy, it also unevenly distributes the state's wealth as a consequence. The end result thereof is a nation comprised of two parts: poverty-riddled cornucopias and towering islands of industrial growth. Who services which needs no elaboration.\n\nThus, the Yakovlev administration's economic advisors have drawn plans to build a network of cities, with their factories and skyscrapers, from Arkhangelsk to Zlatoust. Our results shall prove to the world that the Free Republic has no place for unequal societies."
 NIK_dsnp_a_hand_to_the_west_desc:0 "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world. Those willing to submit their wills and wherewithal to the Free World's cause join Washington's tight-knit circle of allies: the Organization of Free Nations.\n\nSurrounded as it is by existential threats, the Free Republic must approach America as a fellow free nation. Washington's credit and protection may well secure our precarious fortunes throughout this decade's surprises."
 NIK_dsnp_flying_together_desc:0 "It has been some time since America welcomed us heartily into the Free World. Already cooperation's fruits have ripened in both ends of the Atlantic: Arkhangelsk's tonnage figures have multiplied several magnitudes since, while American industries now partake on Russian materials for the first time in decades. With what it has offered, our relationship with the superpower seems set in stone.\n\nPerhaps now is right for expanding this relationship further.\n\nPresident Yakovlev has penned a request for observer status in the OFN, in exchange for granting most favored nation status to its members. This we promise: Russia's wealth shall forever be wedded to freedom."
 NIK_dsnp_onwards_to_the_future_desc:0 "Four times have our fellow socialists derided the methods we abide. Four again have results bade them peace.\n\nPersonal liberties, comfortable lives, a voice in government, an economy worth calling our own... President Yakovlev has achieved all that he had promised, and more. That he had done so while managing the stresses of reconstruction only amplifies victory's sweet succor. With the people in lockstep behind him, the President seeks a bright future to leave them with - a worthy crown to his party's legacy.\n\nAnd what adornment shines brighter than Russia reunited?"

 NIK_smr_reforms_for_russia_desc:0 "West Siberia has fallen to the Free Republic. With the task our generals had accomplished, it is time for our economists to do their jobs bringing the Republic's bounty to the region.\n\nKonstantin Katushev lived through the Soviet Union's downfall, and then survived the political machinations of one of its many successors, fully believing in one fundamental truth: that reform once elevated old Russia into a superpower.\n\nAnd reform shall soon restore new Russia as one."
 NIK_smr_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "In truth, we have much to thank for the warlords and petty statelets which once lorded over West Siberia. Differences in ideology must not blind us from the fact that their governments paid close attention to reconstructing their lands until fields can be harvested for crops, mines extracted for ores, and factories retooled for consumer goods. Our tenuously balanced treasury is doubtless pleased over the improvements already made.\n\nBut that does not mean the Republic's new fields, mines and factories need no more attention. For all that the warlords can make treasure out of nothing, their shambolic works still pale before those built by a modern, mature economy - one like ours, for instance. President Katushev has thus decided to allocate a portion of our budget towards projects in Russia's new territories, that their facilities will be brought to par with Syktyvkar's finest."
 NIK_smr_expand_on_kibersin_desc:0 "Project KiberSin has been bearing fruit in Western Russia. The data received from the computers has proven invaluable in advancing our economy onto the world stage. However, currently our KiberSin infrastructure is limited to Western Russia, and we now have annexed a large amount of territory that is in desperate need of economic recovery programs.\n\nIn order to make the Western Siberian economy more efficient and more effective, our President has proposed for increased funding to be allocated to Project KiberSin, and for additional KiberSin offices to be constructed in key locations across Western Siberia. Our government has determined the cities of Tyumen, Omsk, Sverdlovsk, and Nizhny Tagil to be prime locations for these offices. Not only will these offices help open up much-needed job opportunities in these recently incorporated cities, but they are also the largest economies in Western Siberia, and therefore are most in need of Project KiberSin's optimization."
 NIK_smr_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. As such, our President has approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern, to be aided by Project KiberSin once it is further developed, in order to ensure that oil reaches its destination on time and in sufficient quantities. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 NIK_smr_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Wise men save their money while fools spend theirs towards, even beyond, bankruptcy. Wiser men, however, spend their savings on investments which generate money, ensuring that their total savings grow by the year. So do these men shield themselves from externalities while simultaneously enlarging their fortunes.\n\nA sovereign wealth fund applies wiser men's logic to a nation-state's scale. Managed by financial experts, it receives money from the government and funnels them as principal towards well-earning stocks and bonds. Both principal and interest may then be utilized for whatever higher purpose the fund is bestowed.\n\nFor the Free Republic, and its generous influx of oil money, that purpose is securing every registered citizen a comfortable life even when they are old and infirm."
 NIK_smr_a_fruitful_reunification_desc:0 "The Warlord Era had been harsh on the Russian people. Many of us still recall the days when entire families succumbed to starvation, sickness, or the depredations of bandits. Some may even know these unfortunate souls, or once belonged as their kin. Though much of the Era's sufferings are behind us now, the gruesome scars have left behind still lie plain for all to see. One of these scars is poverty - abominably high poverty.\n\nAs the rightwise government of all Russia, it is our responsibility to uplift its people from their sorry states. In this we will be assisted by a safety net strong enough to keep every citizen from experiencing the miseries they and theirs had scant years ago."
 NIK_smr_approach_the_siberian_liberals_desc:0 "Despite the recent integration of Western Siberia, the various administrations of the region have not disappeared. While some of the politicians are far too dangerous to allow into our democracy, especially considering the tumultuous history our Republic shares with extremists. However, some of these administrations are filled with sensible enough people.\n\nBoris Yeltsin, a politician from Sverdlovsk, has been a democratic advocate for some time now, and we welcome him and his colleagues with open arms. Similarly, the liberals of Zlatoust can be relied upon for political support. We shall be discussing with these factions, and we can use their recommendations for various bureaucratic positions in our new local governments. Of course, we shall also be ensuring that SMR politicians find their way into the most critical roles of these governments, to ensure these governments are ultimately aligned with our values."
 NIK_smr_reestablish_the_siberian_republics_desc:0 "The old Soviet Union made many mistakes, but we do not need to dismiss all of its decisions with the same broad brush. Specifically, the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics, which helped provide representation to the various minority groups within the Soviet Union. Western Siberia is home to many minorities, and our Republic should aspire to ensure these minorities receive the same level of equality and autonomy within our system as they possessed in the old Soviet system.\n\nOur President wishes to recreate these Siberian ASSRs, although modified to better fit our government's structure. With the Siberian Minority Representation & Autonomy Act, several Autonomous Republics will be carved out of Western Siberia, and staffed with various ethnic and religious minorities that require greater representation within our democratic system."
 NIK_smr_crafting_our_future_desc:0 "When Pyotr Alekseevich became Peter the Tsar, he inherited a backwater from his father Alexis and brother Fyodor. Its cities hearkened the Kievan Rus' in their antiquity and bucolia. Its laity lived almost to a man as illiterate peasants and serfs. Its nobles and generals ruled their fiefdoms like free boyars, rather than subjects of an Imperial Majesty. Lesser men would be tempted to leave the state of things be; after all, what use was there changing an unstoppable force's course?\n\nBut Peter proved himself above and beyond men as concept altogether. By his decrees were our greatest cities willed into existence. By his tutelage, the evolution of peasants into intellectuals, craftsmen, clergymen. And by his ironclad will, seditious subjects and rapacious rivals alike humbled before the twin-headed eagle. The emperor's passing completed Peter the Tsar's metamorphosis into Peter the Great: guiding light and model for all Russians, regardless of ideology.\n\nIt is his footsteps which we had followed yesterday, are following today, and will follow tomorrow. History repeats in cycles - and as sure as the world turns about itself, so too shall Russia repeat the reforms which blossom sun-kissed sunflowers from its all-encompassing wastelands."
 NIK_smr_expanding_university_funding_desc:0 "The quality of life in Russia is beginning to rise, and our economy is doing well. With increased prosperity comes increased demand for a skilled workforce, and to obtain these skilled people, we need to educate the people. Unfortunately, university-level education has not been a high-priority for Russians ever since it collapsed into anarchy. Our President shall be increasing the funding reserved for universities and higher education.\n\nIncreased university funding will also aid our research endeavors, replenish Russia's academic scene, and it is the next step in advancing our nation to the modern age. Russian thinkers shall once more share their knowledge with the world."
 NIK_smr_new_conservationism_desc:0 "A core part of Russia is her beautiful, unending nature. The Union of Young Reformers has always stood for protecting the environment, as it is humanity's duty to be the stewards of this earth. With Western Siberia's beautiful forest, tundra, and mountainous landscapes now under our control, we must ensure that these beautiful lands are not butchered by industrialists and the greedy. Of course, our mission is made more difficult by those who governed Western Siberia before us. Tyumen and Omsk, their environments decimated and polluted by the policies of Kaganovich and the Black League. We must clean up their mess, and protect what's left."
 NIK_smr_a_hand_to_the_west_desc:0 "Far beyond the Reich's clutches stands watch the United States of America. Since its loss in the Second World War, the Western Hemisphere's colossus has prevented the Germans and Japanese from exporting their poisonous fascisms to other free countries around the world.

 NIK_psd_the_sovereign_mandate_desc:0 "We just secured a new mandate spanning the entirety of Russia. We must use it to spread our fair democracy to our brethren in West Russia as well as our new residents in West Siberia. Our Republic must make itself worthy for public support and ensure a strong, sovereign Russia that is by the people, for the people. Only then can we unite with our rivals and stand against the Nazi menace."
 NIK_psd_reconstructing_the_wasteland_desc:0 "Currently, one of our biggest problems lies in our infrastructure. Even though our predecessors treated this land well and gave it life, there is still much more we can do to build this country up. For now, we should focus on restoring infrastructure and improving our cities to develop a strong core.\n\nNot only will our land development allow troops to move faster, but it will keep our population well-fed, a quality that not many Russian warlords have for their people."
 NIK_psd_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc:0 "Our Republic currently suffers from internal strife within the general population. Our citizens often criticize our military expansion, which leads to conflict between civilians and the government. A new welfare program should both strengthen the Republic and quell the many disputes arising between our people and the administration."
 NIK_psd_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "Through our military conquests we have captured many sources of oil. We now have plenty of oil to sustain our military and provide a surplus to our citizens. It would be beneficial for us to create our very own oil and gas administration to manage the energy resources we have gathered. Through this, we could give a little extra power to the energy sector of our Republic."
 NIK_psd_establish_the_russian_sovereign_wealth_fund_desc:0 "Our economy is in need of a sovereign wealth fund that can be used to properly develop Russia. We need to establish a central bank that can invest in stocks, bonds, hedge funds, anything to enhance our public finance. Having this kind of investment fund will pull us closer to the economic prosperity we need to produce a strong Russia and help our citizens live wealthy lives."
 NIK_psd_siberian_security_desc:0 "Our conquests in West Siberia not only gave us more resources to work with, but we also have more potential threats to handle. Political opponents still remain throughout the deserted region. We must make sure the residents of Siberia are held to the same nationwide standards as everyone else, while getting rid of the dreaded Tyumen and Black League terrorists. It is our job to ensure the Republic is safe from the domestic extremists."
 NIK_psd_the_association_registry_act_desc:0 "With an ever-growing population of Russians from across Eurasia, there is bound to be a few political dissenters here and there. We must make it clear that some of these ideologies will not be tolerated, as they are against the principles of human liberty. We should pass an act that requires all former members of the Communist Party and Black League to disclose their membership so that we know who these dissenters are. Any person who was once affiliated with either party and refused to disclose it will be arrested."
 NIK_psd_partnerships_in_zlatoust_desc:0 "We look to the East and find our newly acquired West Siberian region, a place where trade once reigned as Yevgeny Dragunov made a fortune selling his guns to the long-extinguished warlords. We could learn a few lessons from his government's former administration. We need to partner up with Zlatoust's former bureaucrats and businessmen to solidify our control of the region, while also scouting for people who are experienced in administrative positions."
 NIK_psd_extending_democracy_desc:0 "We have been growing powerful in our little corner of the world, and some in our administration even say we're approaching World Power status. It seems like our mission of spreading democracy to all of Russia is finally starting to pay dividends. Our people could always use a morale boost to get them working harder, encouraging them to go beyond the imaginary limits that once confined us to our portion of Russia. We all must work to bring the blessing of human liberty to the entirety of what was once the oppressive Soviet Union."
 NIK_psd_encourage_local_democracy_desc:0 "The federal government always seems to have the greatest concentration of power, but it is the local government where the people's voice is best heard. Local administrations are much better suited to tackle local problems than the federal government, so we should encourage the people to participate in their regional elections. The most important changes often come from elections at the lowest level of democracy."
 NIK_psd_a_framework_for_popular_involvement_desc:0 "We need to come up with a plan to secure our democratic ideals in case something unfortunate happens in the next elections. We will establish a framework for regional referendums to ensure that the public majority still supports our cause even if we somehow lose the next vote. That way, the PSD agenda will be diffused among the population where it could counteract a potential PSD loss in the elections."
 NIK_psd_further_ofn_ties_desc:0 "Many members of our government watched the rise of Fascist and Communist regimes with their own eyes, and we all watched chaos ravage what was left of the Soviet Union. Even today, we often witness the brutal oppression set forth by the Nazi Party and the Empire of Japan. Our democratic brothers in North America and Australia work to defend the fledgeling democracies around the world, and we want to join their ranks one day. To start, we need to extend more diplomatic overtures to the OFN and let them know of our intentions"
 NIK_psd_the_twin_eagles_desc:0 "Our relationship with the OFN has been rather minor, as they still view us as a smaller force within the vastness of decayed Russia. We must send our diplomats to attend meetings with OFN affiliates if we are ever going to increase our diplomatic status with the organization. It would also benefit us to invoke the National Sovereignty Act in order to gain an OFN defensive guarantee. Through these first maneuvers we will improve our relationship with the United States and, like two soaring eagles, we will fight to the death to ensure democracy for all the struggling people of the world."
 NIK_psd_onwards_to_the_future_desc:0 "In this term we have accomplished many of our goals, both foreign and domestic. We worked with our resource departments to improve the economy, we worked to shatter the authoritarian influence at home, and we worked to better our relationship with the OFN. One major goal remains: we must fight to bring all the Russian people together under a banner of freedom, of life, liberty, and prosperity. It is during this term that we will unite all of Russia against the wicked Nazi influence that demolished the identity of Russia long ago. It is time for the Free Republic to start her final offensive."

 NIK_stalina_the_reconstruction_of_russia_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government now controls all of western Russia, with the recent annexation of Western Siberia. However, Western Siberia is marred by terrorism and the aftermath of extremist regimes. Tyumen's Communist Party and the Black League need to be hunted down and exterminated. Once that is done, we can build a decent administration in the region, that will facilitate our eastern expansion. It will be hard work, but President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government are used to hard work at this point."
 NIK_stalina_securing_the_peoples_faith_desc:0 "The people of Russia need something to trust, something to keep them safe, something to support. We need to show them that we are the party of strength, stability, and national pride. We need to secure the people's support, because without it Russia will surely fall to extremism. Therefore, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved increased production of propaganda, and bribing off every semi-important public figure we can find. Once the people are surrounded on all sides by praise, they will have no choice but to support the Reconstruction Government."
 NIK_stalina_extend_the_welfarist_model_desc:0 "With the Reconstruction Government facing some dissent from its populace regarding the ever-expanding military, and the lack of democracy in our government. To combat this, President Stalina has suggested the allocation of some funds to the expansion of our nation's social welfare. There are two advantages to this decision: It pleases the populace and gets them to stop protesting against our administration's structures and policies, and it strengthens the nation as a whole. It will solve our most pressing problem, and aid us in the long term. A wise course of action, although it will limit the size of our budget."
 NIK_stalina_escalate_the_national_defense_projects_desc:0 "President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have come to a decision: the national defense projects must be expanded. Large projects such as American-style highways, repairing damaged infrastructure, and other such plans will produce large numbers of jobs, combatting the unemployment problem within our nation. We shall also order the Russian states to expand their defense economies, lifting some of the strain of economic management from the central government. This will also hopefully soothe the populace, who had been growing somewhat discontent as of recent. These actions shall strengthen our nation and prepare the Motherland for what's to come."
 NIK_stalina_consolidate_the_energy_sector_desc:0 "With both the regions of Western Russia and Western Siberia under our control, we now have an unimaginable amount of resources. While some private enterprises are already making moves to establish their domination over these markets, we must ensure that our nation's oil production is handled efficiently and effectively. If we can harvest our own oil supply directly, we will be able to fuel our military at a much cheaper cost. As such, President Stalina and the Reconstruction Government have approved the creation of a state-run oil and gas concern in order to efficiently manage the oil industry and ensure the efficiency of the nation's energy sector. This firm will also ensure that profits from the oil industry don't simply end up in the hands of oligarchs. Using this firm, our government should be able to expand our oil reserves and use the profits to fund projects that give back to the people."
 NIK_stalina_establish_the_russian_sovereign_welfare_fund_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government has a lot of plans for the Motherland. Unfortunately, we do not have the funds to put these plans into action. However, the National Reconstruction Council has come up with a solution to this problem. With approval from President Stalina, the National Reconstruction Council has greenlit the creation of the Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund.\n\nThe Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund is a state-owned investment fund, the money coming from the nation's banking reserves and our annual revenue. The wealth from this entity will go directly to the Motherland and her people. This will allow us to fund the development of infrastructure and improve our citizens' lives in other, more direct ways. The Russian Sovereign Wealth Fund should be relatively risk-tolerant, so it also is a fairly safe decision. The National Reconstruction Council sees no reason to delay its creation."
 NIK_stalina_a_hand_towards_the_east_desc:0 "The Reconstruction Government has reclaimed and integrated Western Siberia into the Republic, but our work there is not yet concluded. Lots of work will be needed to raise the region to our government's standards of development. Once we do that, the people of Western SIberia will be able to have the same confidence in our political institutions as the rest of our citizens.\n\nOf course, our work in Western Siberia will not be peaceful. Extremists from Tyumen's Communist Party and Omsk's Black League have continued to fight guerilla campaigns, attacking our soldiers and our civilians. These terrorists need to be hunted down and eliminated, for the safety of the Republic. The scars left by Western Siberia's extremists will heal with the passage of time."
 NIK_stalina_break_the_hidden_circles_desc:0 "While their regimes have fallen, the extremists continue to thrive in secret. Despite our best efforts, members of the Black League and the Communist Party have slipped through the cracks and infiltrated our state. The Background Disclosure Act requires all former members of either organization to disclose their past membership. This information will henceforth be made available to the public, so that they can't suppress the truth. Anyone who refuses to disclose their membership and is revealed to have been part of either extremist organization will be arrested, and charged with conspiracy."
 NIK_stalina_the_yekaterinburg_commission_desc:0 "Currently, our temporary military administrations in Western Siberia are both understaffed and under-prepared for governance. These temporary structures were supposed to be just that, temporary. However a lack of trusted bureaucrats led to our government struggling to form proper, permanent administrations.\n\nTo combat this, President Stalina and the National Reconstruction Council have approved the formation of the Yekaterinburg Commission. This commission's duty will be to locate administrative candidates within Western Siberia and rehabilitate them. While these candidates and bureaucrats may have worked for extremist regimes, the Yekaterinburg Commission will determine which candidates can be expected to abandon their radical ideologies. Once enough positions can be filled, a proper administration will be established in Western Siberia."
 NIK_stalina_redefining_politics_desc:0 "It has become clear to our nation, that ideology is a corrupting force, radicalizing those who follow these ideals. Instead of simply weakening ideology, we should focus on prioritizing pragmatism in our governance. All of Russia needs to learn to push ideological conflict aside, and accept our shared values: Freedom, Sovereignty, and Pragmatism.\n\nPolitics should revolve around these shared values, and shift towards simply solving problems without considering how these problems fit into greater ideological frameworks. Politics at their core should be utilitarian and unbiased. The best way to destroy extremism is to instigate this cultural shift, and sway the people to our side.""
 NIK_stalina_the_toolbox_theory_desc:0 "As President Stalina continues on her quest to divorce politics from ideology, she has adopted the Toolbox Theory. The theory is very simple: politics and political processes are tools used to solve practical problems. Rational people do not throw out the toolbox and resort to extremism to solve problems, such behavior merely causes new problems to appear. Instead, the answer to all problems lies in our political institutions. All we need to do is use them properly, and use them wisely."
 NIK_stalina_a_foundation_for_the_future_desc:0 "Once the government is stable, extremism is destroyed, and the Motherland united, it will be time to dissolve the Reconstruction Government. In its place, free and democratic elections will commence, and we will have institutions in place to ensure this.\n\nThe elections will be modeled after the Komi Republic's system, the President elected directly via ranked-choice voting, while the Vice-President is appointed by the National Assembly after the elections. The unicameral legislature will have two-year election cycles, while the President shall be elected every every four years, and there will be no term limits for both the legislature and the Presidency. The Komi Republic's problem was its kow-towing to extremism, not its government structure."
 NIK_stalina_answer_the_eagles_cry_desc:0 "The key to Russia's future is the OFN, and they are going to be our most important partners as we prepare to unite the Motherland. As such, we need to attempt to obtain increased status within the OFN. This would allow us to attend meetings of OFN-affiliate nations, and acquiring a defensive guarantee.

 komiintro.0.t:0 "The Republic"
 komiintro.0.d:0 "The Komi Republic - a rare democracy within the Russian Anarchy. Almost unique for a statelet in the bomb-ravaged west, the Republic functions as an independent nation-state, with a formalized economy, political system, and the closest thing to free elections that one is likely to get in West Russia.\n\nEver since the foundation of the Republic in the wake of the West Russian War, putting an end to the political violence that plagued Syktyvkar beforehand, the Republic has stood strong, its borders spanning from the Vychegda to the Vyatka Rivers, and its economy managing to grow slowly and steadily.\n\nHowever, the foundation of the Republic did not end the woes of Syktyvkar and the Komi region in general. The city of Syktyvkar, during the West Russian War, gained a reputation as a cutthroat and critical node of the Front's governing apparatus. Former political prisoners and ideologues were set free to ply their trades in the city, as the authority that ran their former prisons dissolved. Political refugees from all corners of West Russia fled into the Republic - socialists and republicans from Vyatka and right-wingers from Arkhangelsk mingled freely in the teeming capital of the Republic.\n\nKomi is known for its democracy, indeed, but the results of this reputation as a place of freedom has acquired an ugly side - the paramilitaries.\n\nThe streets of Syktyvkar are infamous for their bouts of political paramilitary violence, protests and riots. With the second national-level election approaching in late 1963, this violence has only been growing, and many of the citizens of the Republic wonder - can democracy survive in Komi, or is it doomed to fall to despotism like the rest of the Russian anarchy?"
 komiintro.0.a:0 "We shall bear the torch forevermore."

 komiintro.1.t:0 "The Custodian"
 komiintro.1.d:0 "The workday of Nikolai Voznesensky passed in an unbearable, soul-crushing yet in no way carefree routine. Only having reached the threshold of the presidential residence with his leisurely step, the President was immediately caught in the intrigues and schemes of the Komi politics, dealing with the chaos that engulfed the newborn Republic. The chaos to which he no less than the radicals he despised.\n\nIn a short moment of distraction, Voznesensky could not help but indulge himself in reminiscences about the early days of the Republic, the time when everything seemed so easy, so achievable. The applauding crowd in the speech hall, the lowered Soviet flag, the cheering demonstrations for the new era in the Russian democracy - it looked so vivid and yet so dissonant with his new reality.\n\nThe idealistic memories of the birth of the Republic were darkened by the image of Zhdanov, a Janus-faced and smug creature accompanied by Suslov, the Mephistopheles in flesh, all sitting next to him on the round table and waiting for their share in the newly founded state. He held nothing but contempt for them, but even being charitable to his past actions, he was honest at least to himself about his own role in enabling the Communists, in their corruption of the young democracy.\n\nPerhaps, all of it could be done differently. The Republic didn't have to surrender to the Communist demands in exchange for the false sense of security. It didn't have to be a welcoming haven for the pitiable scum who found no place for themselves but in Syktyvkar. Whether what could be done, it is much too late. The past was the past. All that mattered was that Voznesensky had to carry his unenviable burden alone, clumsily maneuvering in the web that enveloped Komi.\n\nThe sound of gunfire behind the window helped to sober his reflections. Sighing in response to the habitual barbarity he grew used to a long time ago, Voznesensky took a folder in the bosom and put on his coat. Leaving the residence, he took a long way to his house, to the opposite side of the road where another street fight occurred."
 komiintro.1.a:0 "It is still worth it. It has to be."
 
 komiintro.2.t:0 "The Peacemaker"
 komiintro.2.d:0 "The meeting was mostly going as planned. Alexei Kosygin was discussing various topics with several of the more right-wing members of the democratic coalition. The discussions fo future cabinet positions went fine, with Kosygin mostly satisfied with the various compromises made. He had managed to squeeze in a few more candidates from his own party, the Union of Young Reformers. He discussed upcoming campaign strategies, seeing which districts would have more or less funding from which parties, and working to discuss ways to penetrate some of the more radical districts. However, Kosygin was not surprised when the mention of political radicals derailed the meeting.\n\n'Those communists are going to tear down all of the progress we've made in the name of their so-called 'people's revolution!' Popular my ass, our democratic coalition is the only thing keeping Komi from falling to wanna-be despots!' exclaimed one politician, and it seemed many of those present agreed with him. He continued on, 'And what is Voznesensky doing, huh?! He's cuddling with them! The DSNP are destroying this coalition, and I won't stand for it!' This could get out of hand, a fracture in the coalition could seriously damage their performance in the elections, allowing the radicals to gain power. Kosygin had to do something.\n\n'Friends, colleagues, I understand your fears, truly, I do. I myself am wary of Voznesensky's weak stance towards extremism. However, endangering the coalition's unity is not what the Republic needs, we must instead look at our alternatives,' Kosygin paused briefly, 'Voznesensky has led our Republic for some time, and Komi has grown considerably under his leadership despite the bombings. However, Komi, I feel, may need someone new in charge. Someone who can truly heal Komi of its most infectious disease. Elections are soon, friends, and we stand for democracy, do we not?' Kosygin had been thinking about the elections a lot recently, and the idea of becoming President was becoming more and more seductive. EIther way, it seems his colleagues were pleased by his little speech, and it seems disaster had been averted for now."
 komiintro.2.a:0 "If we wish to see the sun, we must weather the coming storm."

 komiintro.3.t:0 "The Defender"
 komiintro.3.d:0 "Svetlana Stalina looked down at the shuffled papers on her desk, as the lights flickered once more. She barely noticed, instead running a finger along a neatly-written note in one of the margins.\n\n"Future Mayoral Candidate?", it said, next to a grainy photo of a smiling woman.\n\nShe nodded to herself. She would be perfect. Another name went down on the list she was assembling - another person to contact, to fund, and align. One more for the endless lists of personnel that the governing coalition employed to keep the Republic running.\n\nA thought flickered through her mind - an image of her combined proposals for appointments. What a government that would be! Free of radicals and subversives, free of corruption, and dedicated to the Republic over all else. Men and women who knew, above all, that there was a greater good to work towards.\n\nAs she placed the list to the side, and looked absently at the now cold cup of tea that was sitting forgotten on the other side of her desk, she wondered just how her personal path had ended here. Her transformation from the young decadent party-goer that she resented so much, to a dedicated public servant.\n\nIt did not matter, she decided. It was merely a matter for a record, to be consigned to distant memory.\n\nAs always, in personal development and politics, the true important thing to think about was the ends - the now, and the future."
 komiintro.3.a:0 "It will all pay off, someday."

 komiintro.5.t:0 "The Paragon"
 komiintro.5.d:0 "The door swung smoothly to the side as Anatoly crept into the house, slowly letting out a terrified breath. Clutching the pistol at his side, he advanced down the hall, ignoring the quiet chatter of the bodyguards in the other rooms. They wouldn't dare disturb their master while he slept, he hoped, prayed, even. As he reached the last door, a plain, wooden thing, and wrapped his shaking hand around the knob, Anatoly felt a small smile creep onto his face. This was much easier than expected, wasn't it? All he had to do was shoot an old, sleeping man in the head, and it would be done. The Republic would be free of a devil.\n\nAnatoly entered the small bedroom, squinting in the dark as he raised his pistol at the dark mass on the bed -\n\nThe first shot hit Anatoly in the hand. The next in the knee. He squealed in pain as he snapped his gaze towards the darkened corner the shots had come from, nausea rocking his stomach as he met the gaze of his target, sitting comfortably on a leather chair.\n\n"Come now," Mikhail Suslov intoned, barely above a whisper. "Surely you didn't think no one's ever attempted to kill me before?" Anatoly opened his mouth to speak, to jeer the famed shadow master of Komi; all that exited his throat was a whimper. Suslov shook his head. "A shame. Usually Gumilyov's lambs are made of sterner stuff."\n\nHe pulled the trigger again, and Anatoly saw no more.\n\nSuslov stood from his chair, sliding the still-smoking pistol back into his jacket, gaze fixed on his bodyguard as he burst into the room. "Leave him on the steps of the National Assembly. Gumilyov hasn't gotten the message yet, it seems.""
 komiintro.5.a:0 "Perhaps another demonstration is in order."

 komiintro.6.t:0 "The Visionary"
 komiintro.6.d:0 "The winds blew cold through the Komi night, as the shadow tramped through the field. The snow crunched beneath his feet until he reached the ideal spot. The night was clear and silent, perfect for his surreptitious observations. He placed the long case in the field, withdrawing the tripod, deftly expanding it, and attaching the telescope to the top.\n\nHis nighttime adventures were a risk, of course. Suslov had expressed concern for his safety, fearing assassination attempts from the Passionary. But if even Comrade Suslov's men did not know of his excursions, how dangerous could it be?\n\nGlancing into the telescope, Andrei Zhdanov's mind wandered. Far away from the lights of Syktyvkar, that snake pit of intrigue and violence, he found serenity in the gentle movements of the stars. Perhaps out there, lay hope. Other beings who overcame their petty infighting and defeated their worst qualities, an example for humanity to follow into a new age. Freedom from want, freedom from conflict, and freedom from ignorance lay within the grasp of humanity. It was such a shame that it had been squandered for so long, on the petty conflicts of the last decade and the great battle with the backwards, regressive Germany.\n\nBut soon, the time would come. His vision would guide Russia, and the world, into a brave new era. And mankind would be free."
 komiintro.6.a:0 "The way forward lies in our hands."

 komiintro.7.t:0 "The Seeker"
 komiintro.7.d:0 "Svetlana Bukharina smiled cordially for the fifth time at the fifth representative; shook his hand, promised a bright future working together, and stepped away for the fifth time. They never asked her anything about herself, she noticed, only her father. "Your father would be so proud," They'd say, "If only he could see you know," to which she'd smile and agree, promising to follow in dear old Nikolai's footsteps.\n\nShe wasn't so ignorant. This meeting was a productive one, though not for the reasons the rest of the Communist Party thought. It wasn't a mere get-together for her, no, this was a valuable opportunity to learn who the true threats in Komi were, and more importantly, how they could be taken down. The man who had just spoken to her, she noticed with some grim satisfaction, was a coward. The second she'd disagreed with him on a minor dispute, he'd backed down and apologized thoroughly. Someone like that was a follower, not a leader.\n\nSerov had watched her carefully, as expected. A fearsome man, for sure, but he hadn't considered that his prey would be watching him just as carefully. What she took the most interest in was the man's apparent disregard for common Communist theory - the way he spoke reminded Svetlana of what little nazi propaganda she had suffered through in the past.\n\nThe Party was nearing a breaking point, she concluded at the end of the night. Zhdanov and Suslov, for all of their attempts to enforce unity, could not control everyone. Serov would be the first to go, she reasoned, but certainly not the last. A new rising star in the party would be a welcome sight for many, a reassurance that the glory days of the Union were not all lost.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina would be that, but unlike her dear father, she wouldn't let Russia slip through her fingers."
 komiintro.7.a:0 "A new player enters the game."

 komiintro.8.t:0 "The Trailblazer"
 komiintro.8.d:0 "Ivan Serov watched the streets of Komi from his apartment, a frown creasing his face as he watched the sheep mill about below. He hadn't slept well in weeks, and so he had developed this habit of watching the city below, pondering his existence. He was a socialist, he reasoned, always among the most loyal in the entirety of the NKVD, so why did he have so many doubts of late?\n\nHe was always proud of Russia, nationalistically so, even, but surely that was merely because of their former status as a great socialist power? And certainly not in the same way as the Italians, or even the Germans? He shook his head. No, he was better than them, wasn't he?\n\nBut why shouldn't one be devoted to their home above all else? Perhaps the Union wouldn't have fallen if they had fought with the same brutal pride that the Nazis did? Serov felt a churning of doubt within his gut, one that had only intensified over the past weeks. Perhaps he wasn't wrong? Maybe, just maybe, it was Suslov and Zhdanov were misguided about such questions?\n\nMaybe Serov could teach them his new ideas?\n\nA smile crossed his face as he considered, and for the first time in what seemed like years, the churning in his guts lessened. He would lead the Communist Party, and Komi with it, to greatness.\n\nHe stormed to his desk, placed a fresh sheet of paper into his typewriter, and began.\n\nWith this, he would change socialism forever."
 komiintro.8.a:0 "An innovator, or a madman?"

 komiintro.9.t:0 "The Crusader"
 komiintro.9.d:0 "The speaker atop the stage smiled warmly at his audience. They had been so leery, so unreceptive when he was first introduced. Eurasianism had never quite caught on in the Republic of Komi, apart from in his own clique. It wasn't that he or his ideas were an unknown quantity in the Republic - quite the opposite. His infamy was likely the reason that the evening of lectures had been boycotted by Komi's leftists and democrats. And yet, despite everything, he still stood facing a packed theater - one that was conspicuously devoid of hecklers.\n\n"Often," he said, moving into the end of his lecture, "I am thus interrogated: 'Lev Nikolayevich, you call yourself a rightist, yet you advocate against the very things that all true rightists stand for! You do not stand for the church, for the supremacy of Russia, for the glory of the Tsars! What, then, can you possibly offer the people of Russia?'"\n\nThe audience remained silent - but it was a silence of rapt attention. The speaker continued. "People of Syktyvkar, you have heard me speak at length tonight of concepts that I do not expect any of you to grasp: Eurasia, Passionarity, the will to change. You came here expecting to hear an alternative to the corrupt and inefficient democracy imposed upon us. I will confess that I am more comfortable explaining myself through the written word, but for the benefit of those not similarly inclined, allow me to elucidate my message as clearly as I can..."\n\nThe room remained silent, and the speaker knew he had them. "I envision a power to eclipse any that has preceded it. A continent-spanning project wherein the greatest strains of the Motherland's ethnicities are forged into an indivisible whole, capitulating only to the singular authority of the state. Not a weary old empire, where a single ethnos seizes power only to stagnate and fall before a mightier foe, but a supra-national entity - the summation of all that has come before it. It will not merely be the Russians and their strengths, but the Ukrainians, the Kazakhs, the Mongols, the Buryats, and so many more! All of us, inheritors of a combined legacy, standing together under a single banner: the Eurasian State!\n\nAs the audience exploded into applause that was more than merely respectful, someone leaned over to his friend and asked innocently: "Pavel, what was that guy's name again?""
 komiintro.9.a:0 "Gumilyov. Lev Nikolayevich Gumilyov."

 komiintro.10.t:0 "The Organizer"
 komiintro.10.d:0 "Igor Shafarevich looked at the window, as the sun slowly crept into the room, an uninvited intruder. Candlelight spilled over to his drafting table, as its glow lost luster. Shafarevich puffed his lips to blow it out, then stopped. Now was not the time for that. Not when he was approaching completion. He took up his pencil and leaned closer to the drawing board. This particular street was difficult to optimize, and it might be better to remove it entirely. Eraser at hand, he wiped it off the map. Much better.\n\nHe adjusted his glasses, discarding his pencil for a pen. He took a step back, seeing his work in its entirety for the first time since last night. To Shafarevich, it was beautiful. Ordered roads, with its sidewalks and pavements, made precisely to accommodate not only the people of Syktyvkar but also to compensate for its population growth. Everyone in Syktyvkar could get from one point to another in less than an hour's travel time. He put the tip of his pen onto the drawing board.\n\nOthers in the National Assembly had mocked him before. The lines on two streets intersected. He reached out to his eraser, finding it in his pocket after a few moments of frantic searching. He erased the obstacle, rearranging them to bear each other's weight, one incoming, one oncoming. This proposal might not get anywhere, considering the political nature of the Republic, but the work was its own reward. Now onto this sidewalk, and unto this pavement, as he drew in his lines and dotted in points along with them: streetlights.\n\nAll of this done, Shafarevich decided to test his creation. The walk from his home to the National Assembly was fifteen minutes. He picked up his pencil again, tracing it along the new route. In his head, his mind ticked. Two meters a second, average walking speed. Nine, ten. Ten minutes! Now for the next step. Much property destruction would be involved in the realization of this plan, and he laid the original design on top of his. Taking out his calculator, he began to count."

 komiintro.11.t:0 "The Regent"
 komiintro.11.d:0 "A cold wind blew through the creaking old church, sending candlelight dancing across the face of the Theotokos set high upon the altar. Her eyes and those of her child stared down at the supplicant kneeling before them, his lips constantly moving in quiet prayer.\n\n"O Heavenly King, the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, Who art everywhere and fillest all things; Treasury of Blessings, and Giver of Life - come and abide in us, and cleanse us from every impurity, and save our souls, O Good One."\n\nSergey Taboritsky paused and shivered as a frigid draft swept over him, its bite sending chills through his old bones. "Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal! Have mercy on us. Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal! Have mercy on us. Holy God! Holy Mighty! Holy Immortal! Have mercy on us..."\n\nThe cold pressed in, piercing the immaculate old Tsarist uniform he wore. Its golden collar felt like a manacle of frozen iron around his neck, and the fine silk lining did nothing to shield him from winter's bite. He grimaced, gritted his teeth and opened his eyes, lifting his head to stare directly into the eyes of the Blessed Virgin. In response, he felt the flame of faith roar to life inside him again, driving the cold from his body. He gasped at the sudden intensity of its heat, but stayed perfectly still. There was a presence behind him, a pair of reassuring hands on his shoulders, gentle whispers in his ears. Moisture gathered in his eyes, and he closed them again, recognizing the familiar sensation for what it was.\n\n"Keep him safe, O Lord," he uttered, speaking directly to the presence. "Watch over our blessed sovereign. Return the Tsarevich to us, when the time comes. Give me the strength to carry out my sacred task, to defeat your enemies, to restore this land to what it should be. I beg you - stand with me, O Lord, and help me save Holy Russia.""

 NIK.1.t:0 "A Free Agent"
 NIK.1.d:0 "Glorious people of the Komi Republic, the time for movement is now! In this world, and even in this Republic, the boot of so-called revolutionary action haunts the people with their lies. They are in our homes, our streets, and they are ready to take action. We must move first, for this Republic must not falter."\n\nConcluding her speech, silence fills the room for but a brief moment before thunderous applause reaches her ears. It seems her message has gotten through.\n\nSvetlana Stalina, a devoted new politician, has quite quickly climbed the byzantine ladder of influence in the Komi Republic, and her messages of anti-revolutionary zeal and revenge against the German menace that plagues the fields of Russia has resonated with at least a sizable portion of the masses. Now, she has become a major political asset in the ever-so complicated political field of Komi, and even opponents of her have come to concede it."
 NIK.1.a:0 "A most magnificent showing."
 NIK.1.b:0 "I sense a darkness within her..."

 NIK.2.t:0 "Stalina Advocates for Stronger Measures"
 NIK.2.d:0 "My fellow Deputies, the enemies of our republic lie around us. They lurk in the darkness, awaiting their opportunity to strike at our foundations and collapse the structure that has held this nation together. We cannot wait! We cannot wait for them to enact this evil plan! We must make the first move - and battle them through any means necessary."\n\nAlthough the sounds of applause filled the chamber almost immediately from Stalina's portion, hushed whispers and glances dominate the rest of the group. The measures Svetlana puts forward are extensive, and involve different varieties of actions against 'enemies of Komi', such as further powers of the ruling party of the legislative chamber, the ability to carry out arrests without warrant of said enemies, and some rumor that, outside of the legal powers, Svetlana will further fund her allied paramilitaries in order to help control the nation. Whether that is true or not, however, does not matter. Svetlana has already made her move."
 NIK.2.a:0 "Could it be necessary?"

 NIK.3.t:0 "Disorder from the Left?"
 NIK.3.d:0 "A malaise hangs in the air for the leftist bloc. Since Stalina's proclamation of destruction of the enemies of Komi, activity has become different than usual. Impromptu, emergency meetings between legislators and paramilitary members. The politicians move unlike anyone has seen them before - with haste and alarm. The meetings, too, show a great change in mood: the whispers grow in number, the applause grows less certain, the glances become only more and more worried.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries, too, show bizarre behavior. Their movements are further mixed up, the graffiti on walls becoming less and less prevalent, and the members themselves encrypting their communications however they can. The presence of trouble is in the atmosphere - and the reasoning is not difficult."
 NIK.3.a:0 "The cracks show."

 NIK.4.t:0 "Kosygin Endorses Stalina's Plan"
 NIK.4.d:0 "The legislation chamber was tense. Stalina's measures had generated plenty of unease within the lawmakers, and all in the room awaited the next person to speak, hoping for some sort of resolution or agreement - anything to break the mold. The next person to speak, the economical genius Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin, highly respected within the democratic Deputies, only intensified the feeling of tenseness.\n\n"Friends and gentlemen, action is necessary. Miss Stalina's plan is necessary. We cannot let the enemies of our beautiful republic destroy our resolve, nor can we let them extinguish our flame. For the security of our democracy, this must happen. Miss Stalina, in fact, should become a critical asset to the party in this matter, and we should all appreciate her guidance as well as her plan of action."\n\nAlthough there was a decent amount of applause, especially from those allied to Kosygin, other members, specifically Voznesensky's wing, were more doubtful. After all, wasn't Stalina with them?"
 NIK.4.a:0 "Let them associate freely."
 NIK.4.b:0 "Could this be a violation of party unity?"

 NIK.5.t:0 "A Pact in Secret"
 NIK.5.d:0 "Following Kosygin's speech, the legislation chamber took a five minute rest and discussion period. To the followers of Voznesensky, however, it seemed like Russia would be reunified before the break would be finished. Discussions in hushed tones dominated all sections of the chamber, but nowhere did it happen more than in Voznesensky's section. As the break reached its end, Voznesensky rose up from his seat and made his way to the podium.\n\n"Kosygin, your plan of action in this chamber do not help us, the party, or the Republic. What you are suggesting is only dividing us further, and constitutes as creating your own alliance with Miss Stalina. I officially condemn your statements. That is all."\n\nWhile some applause rang out, the majority of the Deputies reacted in silence.\n\nAs dusk approached and the session wrapped up, Stalina and Kosygin stayed behind in the room. Their words few, but their motivations plenty, it was agreed on with a simple handshake. An alliance to protect each other, and to serve the republic - through whatever means necessary."
 NIK.5.a:0 "Let's hope it isn't needed."

 NIK.6.t:0 "Unity, for Now"
 NIK.6.d:0 "After the session and Kosygin's controversial speech, two stayed behind in the legislative chamber. The two most influential democrats, the economical masterminds of Komi, the fire and saviours of the Republic must meet.\n\nAlthough the purpose was a brief negotiation, both men proceeded to lose track of time. By the time they finished, it was already near-midnight. However, following a final, genuine handshake, the negotiations were complete. In exchange for Kosygin retracting his statements, Voznesensky would, at a later point in time, send through measures that were more effective. Both men came out of the meeting satisfied, as their party would remain strong - strong enough to withstand any coming political storm."
 NIK.6.a:0 "We must stand together!"

 NIK.7.t:0 "The Thorn in Our Eye"
 NIK.7.d:0 "Voznesensky shifted his gaze around. It was another meeting of the Voznesentsi, and it was a centrist politician's turn to speak. As he spoke, Voznesensky became interested, and as the wheels in his head turned and turned, became perturbed. Although the politician's words were not important, his affiliation was. His mind raced, and his eyes began to take on a knowing glow. One name appeared in his consciousness, again and again.\n\nZhdanov.\n\nIt was a secret. For now. Confined only to a group of a few people. But if it ever got out - Voznesensky shuddered. Just imagining Kosygin's reaction was enough. Then again, Zhdanov was an immeasurably precious asset to him, and if he needed his help, he would get dead air in response.\n\nThe politician finished his words. But he was not focused on the next generic speaker. Voznesensky had to choose..."
 NIK.7.a:0 "Speaking to him was a mistake in the first place."
 NIK.7.b:0 "He is too valuable to cut ties with."

 NIK.8.t:0 "Cutting Ties"
 NIK.8.d:0 "As Voznesensky penned "Sincerely, Nikolai Voznesensky"to his paper, he let out a sigh of relief. The weight of his burden would forever be lifted, and he could rest. No more connections, no more ties, no more association. Voznesensky would be free.\n\nCalling a trusted courier into his office, he ordered the young man to send the letter straight away - his purpose would be official state business, and the contents classified. He placed faith in the deliverer to complete his task timely - for Voznesensky did not know how long these ties could last before being thrust, in an intrusive display, to the unaware public.\n\nThe young courier nodded his head at the command, and was dismissed straight away. His duties were evident to both men, and it was best for him to start accomplishing it. As he left, Voznesensky smiled. Relaxed now, he sat back into his chair and muttered."
 NIK.8.a:0 "Severance, at last."

 NIK.9.t:0 "Our Connections Leaked!"
 NIK.9.d:0 "A crisis has engulfed Komi! Although this headline is not a new one, the details of this particular story have interested both the public and the politicians alike.\n\nAn unknown 'associate' of Nikolai Voznesensky has come forward with damaging information about him - in particular, his connections with a certain radical socialist named Andrei Zhdanov. The leaked documents detail the extent of the connections, highlighting the relationship between Zhdanov and Voznesensky and showing the amount of collaboration.\n\nThe Voznesentsi has been completely shattered by the news, as highly tempered debates run wild in the meeting minutes and legislative sessions following the story being broken. Voznesensky now must face the consequences of his actions, and has already come to a solution regarding how this mess will be handled."
 NIK.9.a:0 "Honesty is the best policy."
 NIK.9.b:0 "This never happened."

 NIK.10.t:0 "Admitting Fault"
 NIK.10.d:0 "Friends of the party and of the Republic. I am aware that you all now know of the allegations regarding my ties to Zhdanov. I must say, with complete truth, that these ties have existed, and-"\n\nShocked exclamations and murmurs filled the chamber as the depths of the situation sunk in to the politicians in attendance. For a solid minute, anarchy ruled over the chamber as arguments began over Voznesenky's true loyalty, only ending when the head of the session declared order be held in the assembly.\n\n"These ties have existed, yes. But these ties are now cut. And they will remain cut for good. My loyalty is not to Zhdanov, but to this Republic we preside over. I implore you all to consider this. Thank you."\n\nThe politicians look over at him, all eyes boring down upon Voznesenky. The fate of his leadership relies on them. And now, they must vote on it."
 NIK.10.a:0 "The Party will decide your fate."
 NIK.10.b:0 "The Party will decide your fate."

 NIK.11.t:0 "Finding Forgiveness"
 NIK.11.d:0 "Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nAnticipation rocked the air as the first hands went up to mark him innocent. After taking the census, the hands now went up to mark him in contempt. Somewhere in Voznesensky's eyes, a glitter showed up.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky, the votes have been counted... by a margin of one hundred and twenty two to seventy eight, you have been found absolved of any crime revealed by these documents presented before us."Voznesensky couldn't help but crack a smile. A closer margin than he would have liked? Sure. Yet, despite the turmoil, he was free."
 NIK.11.a:0 "Lenient, perhaps."

 NIK.12.t:0 "There will be no Forgiveness"
 NIK.12.d:0 "Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky, the voting will now begin. Take your seat."\n\nThe result was quick to arrive. By a margin of one hundred and sixty to forty, Voznesenky was found guilty of his crimes against the Republic of Komi, and will be held in contempt of the legislation chamber. Voznesensky's expression was neutral throughout the vote, revealing nothing of his inner mind or plans. But his expression did not matter anymore. His fate has been sealed, for the talks of removing Voznesensky from power have already begun in the room - and they show no signs of letting up."
 NIK.12.a:0 "No peace. No respite. No mercy."

 NIK.13.t:0 "Covering the Evidence"
 NIK.13.d:0 "The sounds of whitewashing broadcasted itself to an almost empty woods. As the shovel dug on, and the briefcase stood firm in the slight moonlight breeze, the man couldn't help think of the circumstances that led to this point. He had obtained the documents, yes - he sent loyal assistants to take care of that. Without anyone knowing, he had slipped out of Syktyvkar during the dead of night, indeed - he arranged it on an official 'private outing' for the next few days, and he thought, at least, no one suspected the wiser.\n\nThe waxing gibbous and a flashlight was the only sources reflecting on his face, yet on his soul reflected much. But his resolve was clear. He must not let this come to light. Otherwise, too much would be at stake. It was for the good of the Republic, he imagined, as the shovel did the last shoveling of its dirt."
 NIK.13.a:0 "Bury it deep."

 NIK.14.t:0 "A Leak into a Downpour"
 NIK.14.d:0 "Voznesensky placed his head down on his desk. An unfortunate courier had delivered news of another set of documents revealed to the public. Not the first time the news was brought to him, Voznesensky simply sighed and dismissed the messenger, muttering a curse word to him under his breath.\n\nEver since the evidence was disposed of, the Republic, and the Voznesentsi in particular, have been wracked by yet another political crisis. This one, however, struck the party nerve to the limit. The anonymous source has not slumbered, as new documents and evidence are leaked daily to the Party and the public. Suspicious of Voznesensky due to him not testifying and seeing less of a necessity politicians loyal to him grow fewer by the day.\n\nIn addition to this, rumours have surfaced of even further ties to Zhdanov, to the point where both men would be comfortable with each other in a meeting, swapping jokes as a socialist revolution is plotted. While these are only rumors, they have still dented the reputation of the party, and threaten to destroy entirely the relative internal peace within the legislation chamber."
 NIK.14.a:0 "Could it be unstoppable?"

 NIK.15.t:0 "Hunting the Source"
 NIK.15.d:0 "Gentlemen and ladies of the party. The accusations that befall me are quite obviously untrue. Yet despite this, these rumors continue to flow, and damage our wonderful republic. Due to this...\n\n"This man is a traitor!" outbursts a Deputy, and the entire chamber erupts into chaos. The evident loss of trust in Voznesensky within some sectors of the party continues to manifest itself, until a screech drowns out the arguments and brings order once again to the room.\n\nHolding his microphone, Voznesensky continues. "Now. These rumors are false, yet they damage us. We cannot allow the source of these rumors to continue shrouded in darkness. An investigative committee must, and will be formed. This investigation will encompass any suspected spreader of these rumors. Whoever it is, we will find them, and justice will be served."\n\nThe members, coincidentally Voznesenky's most trusted advisors, have already been selected, and the investigation now begins."
 NIK.15.a:0 "Come out, come out..."

 NIK.16.t:0 "The Party Compromised!"
 NIK.16.d:0 "Voznesensky and his investigative committee glanced at each other with suspense. Progress has been minimal so far into the investigation, and no leads produced conclusive results.\n\nThe tension was shattered with the bursting of a door, and the rushing of a committee member into the room. "The damned Soviet bastards! They're watching us!"\n\nThrough an informant with more loyalty to Voznesensky than previously thought, a sweeping revelation came to the attention of the committee: the party - specifically, Voznesensky's own wing of the party - had been infiltrated by spies. Further questioning revealed that these spies were under the command of none other than Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, suspected leader of the many socialist and communist parties and paramilitaries in the Komi Republic.\n\nAfter being told the news, Voznesensky mirrored the faces of the rest of the committee: near-panic. A decision had to be made quickly in order for the agents not to find out - crack immediately down on them, or wait and see what to do next?"
 NIK.16.a:0 "Drop the hammer!"
 NIK.16.b:0 "There will be no hasty moves."

 NIK.17.t:0 "The Democrats' Purge"
 NIK.17.d:0 "The vote is passed. The expulsion of these agents will begin in due process, with no exceptions."\n\nMany members of the democratic party began to sweat. The purge of suspected "agents working for Suslov"began shortly after, with police storming into the legislative chamber and beginning to arrest previously suspected agents. While some offered resistance and admitted themselves, most kept quiet, regardless of their true affiliation.\n\nAfter the arrests were made, Voznesensky made his way to the podium. "Friends of Komi, we can no longer tolerate foreign agents, spies, and traitors in our ranks. This is not the end. More of Suslov's spies are watching us right now. Any so-called Voznesentsi of mine will be subject to further investigation to ensure they are truly loyal to the republic. That is all. You are all dismissed early for the day. Remember where your loyalties should lie.""
 NIK.17.a:0 "How many could there be?"

 NIK.18.t:0 "Svetlana Urges Caution"
 NIK.18.d:0 "After the events of the previous session, the democratic Deputies have turned to a state of hysteria. Accusations fly like never before, hostility is growing, and all worry about the ties and bonds of even of the person sitting right next to them. The loss of unity in the party troubled Svetlana Stalina, and not articulating her own thoughts on the situation would be a grave mistake for the party. After a politician's speech on "destroying the Suslov agents", Stalina took her turn to speak.\n\n"Distinguished Comrades. The situation that has developed in this room does not play to our advantage in the slightest. Instead of questioning the circumstances that led to the documents being leaked, you all assume that the leaker is somewhere in this room, right now. I beg of you to consider this alternate option: the leaker, as he is called, has not, in fact, leaked anything. Rather, it is an organized plan by our enemies - a plan to destabilize our precious democracy by framing someone who has not done anything wrong with crimes against the state. I should know this, because that's what I would do."\n\nLoud mutters filled the chamber at this point, with eyes glanced on Stalina in a worrying fashion. "I believe that this could be a conspiracy, a conspiracy that will send us crashing down in flames. Please, think about it."\n\nThe murmurings in the chamber eventually cease, and some token applause is offered. More, however, are worried on the issue of Stalina admitting that this would be something she would do. Many decide not to think about that."
 NIK.18.a:0 "Ironic."

 NIK.19.t:0 "A Plot!"
 NIK.19.d:0 "The committee members were sure of it. Right there lied the evidence, the proof needed to end this debacle once and for all. A Voznesentsi politician by the name of Nikita Yakovich has been accused of orchestrating the release of documents to the public, as well as spreading rumors that damaged the reputation of Voznesensky himself. Confident in their work and relieved that this emergency may finally come to an end, all but one headed out to begin the proceedings.\n\nHis original purpose was to take one last look at the documents, to oversee his vision for the case: start to finish, the evidence complete. But as he glanced over the document, a detail caught his eye. Didn't it say Yakovich and Zhdanov meet in Yb, where no one would notice yesterday? But this interview here with Yakovich's secretary said he was in the office the whole day. And this detail here is incorrect... and that one... and...\n\nThe committee member widened his eyes. In their haste, they had made basic errors in finding the leaker. The evidence that did implicate him was planted - a set-up. Rushing out of the door, forgetting his hat, he desperately went out of the room and into the night, hopeful to find any way to halt the proceedings... before an innocent man is punished for a crime he did not commit."
 NIK.19.a:0 "Can we stop it in time?"

 NIK.20.t:0 "A Smoking Gun"
 NIK.20.d:0 "Nikita Yakovich, your attention. Deputies, to attention."\n\nWhen the news spread that the leaker that had caused much tension and damage to the democratic coalition had been found, the politicians lit their torches. Following a midnight raid by police on Yakovich's home, seizing him in a state of sleep and reading to him his charges in a courtroom, he was personally sent on Voznesensky's orders to the legislative chamber in order to assure his party that all was well, and that the troubles would be over.\n\nAs Nikita repeatedly pleaded his innocence, to no avail, Voznesensky pointed to the trembling man. "This man - a traitor of the republic and a spy for Suslov - is the man that has caused us great suffering in our legitimacy and in our Komi! Shame onto this man, for he is the leaker - and the evidence has been gathered to prove it!"\n\nAt an undisclosed location, an advisor speaks to one Mikhail Suslov on the news. A slight grin creeps onto his face, his eyes alight with the feeling of yet another pawn moving forward. "Excellent."\n\nVoznesensky took stock of the situation in front of him. He had already privately dismissed the charges against him in court. No, no, the court would not do. He would deal with him personally. But in which way?"
 NIK.20.a:0 "Expelling him will be sufficient."
 NIK.20.b:0 "Call Yuri. Send a message to the rest."

 NIK.21.t:0 "Blackmailing the Problem"
 NIK.21.d:0 "Nikita Yakovich had enough common sense to realize something was amiss. His trial was dismissed. While the police were always nearby, they did not take action against him. While the politicians jeered and glared at him, he was still allowed to conduct limited political duties. It did not click, however, until the night of his retirement.\n\nThe chorus of glances, whispers, and outbursts declaring him an enemy of Komi that had been the drawl of a legislative session had concluded. He was tired and miserable, like the days before, ever since he had been accused of crimes against the state. Arriving at his home, relieved that it had not been destroyed by a German bomb yet, he sat down on his living room chair and lit the fireplace.\n\nA knock on the door interrupted his thoughts. Opening it, he was surprised by the man standing before him: Nikolai Voznesensky himself. "I have come to have a talk with you, Nikita."With no other choice but to invite his guest inside, Yakovich gestured towards him to take a seat beside him at the fireplace. Both men sitting, Voznesenky went straight to the point.\n\n"Quite clearly, Yakovich, your crimes against the state have been appalling to the rest of us. And it would be a shame if something were to further ruin your reputation. Like these pictures, for example..."Yakovich's skin turned a pale white. How did he get those...? "The way I see it, Nikita, you have two options. The first is the merciful one. You will resign from your post as Deputy at once. Or... you can tell your wife-"Yakovich capitulated, agreeing to his demands. The political career of Nikita Yakovich was now over."
 NIK.21.a:0 "Just what he deserves."

 NIK.22.t:0 "Nikita Yakovich Found Dead!"
 NIK.22.d:0 "The Deputy sat in front of his fireplace. His tea boiled, and his watch read half past eight. Looking around, a figure stood in front of him-\n\nA flash. A bang. A thud. Nikita Yakovich went dead silent.\n\nNews from Syktyvkar today, as alleged leaker of damaging documents related to Voznesensky has been found shot dead inside of his home. The Deputy's watch was reported to have stopped around dusk, and according to the autopsy, appeared to have died immediately from two bullet wounds, one to the head and the other to the heart. However, despite the gruesome shooting leaving a mark on the public consciousness, there is still no evidence of the identity of the killer, nor if there was a motivation behind it. It seems another senseless killing has plagued our republic...\n\nVoznesensky laughed at the news report. Yuri had done his job well, as expected. His immediate payment would include a bonus, even! He was feeling generous today. The leaker is dead. And that is what mattered."
 NIK.22.a:0 "He will not be missed."

 NIK.23.t:0 "The Innocent Verdict"
 NIK.23.d:0 "He wasn't there that Thursday, Nikolai. That's the only thing that needs to be said and our whole structure of power could come tumbling down."\n\nThere were very few times in his life that Voznesensky had been genuinely shocked. Not since the fall of the Union has a realization hit such a poignant note in the politician. This man was innocent. Free of crime. No evidence that holds up. And he had put him out of his job.\n\nNews today reports that the murdered politician, Nikita Yakovich, alleged to be the leaker of state and personal documents, has been declared innocent of all charges. Already, protests have begun to be dispersed by Voznesensky-aligned paramilitaries, and the legislation is determining on their next course of action.\n\nVoznesensky was at a crossroads. He had to do something. But what?"
 NIK.23.a:0 "An innocent on our conscience."
 NIK.23.b:0 "Retract the story!"

 NIK.24.t:0 "Voznesensky, in the Presidium, with the Hit Squad!"
 NIK.24.d:0 "A verdict has been reached in the death of one of our former delegates, and the man who gave the order to have him killed.\n\nFar from what we originally expected, Yakovich was innocent, a victim of one of Suslov's plots to tear down our coalition. Our own Voznesensky, however, had plenty of warning to the contrary. Both Alexei Kosygin and Svetlana Stalina have testified against him in our own internal court, stating that he had ample warning that Yakovich was innocent, and the evidence didn't quite line up. Despite this, he went on with the kill order anyway, and had Yakovich buried in a shallow grave.\n\nThe internal opinion of the Party has shifted radically away from the disgraced Voznesensky, and closer to the ascendant Kosygin and Stalina - the right-center coalition containing our most experienced, and most importantly, less rampant, politicians.\n\nFar from standard procedure, this is an act of murder, and one that sets a dangerous precedent. His penalty shall be a vote of no confidence, and, if cast down from his chair, full legal processing at the hands of his replacement."
 NIK.24.a:0 "You should have listened, Nikolai."

 NIK.25.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
 NIK.25.d:0 "Voznesensky stood before the podium. One hundred and ninety nine faces looked upon him, some with mixed feelings, most others with hatred in their eyes.\n\n"Nikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky. You have been charged, with substantial evidence, of high crimes against one Nikita Yakovich, and against the Republic of Komi. As a result, a vote of no confidence will be levied against you, and a replacement shall be nominated if the vote passes."\n\nVoznesensky started to become drenched with sweat. He had rolled the dice, and he had gotten snake eyes. The question of his survival as leader now was ever-so-present within the nation and the National Assembly. Would he last?"
 NIK.25.a:0 "Out with the old?"

 NIK.26.t:0 "Deprecated"
 NIK.26.d:0 "Voznesensky looked down at his feet. The vote for confidence in him was about to begin, and as he reflected upon himself, he still believed that his policies were still best for the nation. He hoped that they would understand that.\n\n"By a vote of one hundred and sixteen to eighty-four, the National Assembly has declared that you are in no confidence to lead this assembly any longer, Nikolai Voznesensky. Now we begin the process of voting for your replacement. Good day. Take him away, guards."\n\nIn a surprise turn of events, an unexpected candidate, Alexander Belozerov, has been voted in as President! A conservative politician, Belozerov was never the type of person to be cast into the spotlight, instead diligently representing the small center-right wing of his party. However, a combination of previous Voznesensky supporters, having more in number than expected during the no confidence vote, deciding to vote for Belozerov out of dislike of either Kosygin or Stalina, as well as the Stalina and Kosygin blocs devolving into fighting between each other, thus making them unable to unite behind a single leader.\n\nWhile Belozerov, in his acceptance speech, claims he will unite the republic and bring order to the congress, many Deputies, even those within his own wing, see him as an ineffective choice for President, and such a President may even allow for something as drastic as the fall of democracy in Komi..."
 NIK.26.a:0 "A new name to learn..."

 NIK.27.t:0 "Kosygin Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.27.d:0 "Voznesensky gazed at the ceiling, not even bothering to see the expressions of his comrades. Did it matter who supported him at this point? What was the point if everything he worked for was ruined? All he could do is await his verdict.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky. By a vote of one hundred and sixty-nine to thirty-one, you have been removed from office effective immediately. Security will now escort you out. Have a good day, sir. The voting for your replacement will now begin."\n\nThe choice for President has been decided: Alexei Nikolayevich Kosygin, a well-known economic mastermind and representative of his liberal wing of the democratic party, accepted his new post today as the President of the Republic of Komi. Vowing to steer the republic without influence of the more radical ideologies inside of it, his experience and age has made him an ideal pick for those seeking stability and democracy after Voznesensky's fall from grace. While he is slightly more right-wing than Voznesensky, his desire to keep the flame of democracy alive in Komi still beats. The legislation has reacted rather favorably to the news, with plenty of applause being present during and after his acceptance speech. It seems a new dawn of democracy has shined on the Republic of Komi."
 NIK.27.a:0 "A change for the better?"

 NIK.28.t:0 "Stalina Inaugurated as President!"
 NIK.28.d:0 "Voznesensky wore the scowl on his face proudly. How dare those traitors throw him to that horde of angry politicians? After all he did for this glorious republic. They should all be ashamed of themselves, and this republic will fall to the ground because of them.\n\n"The hands that call for his removal are... one hundred and forty-three... the hands that oppose are fifty-seven. Voznesensky, by the voting of this National Assembly, the government of the Republic has expressed no confidence in your leadership. Your replacement will be voted on now. Security, escort this man out."\n\nIt is official: Svetlana Stalina has been made President of the Republic of Komi. Managing an upset victory, her acceptance speech pledged that any threats to the order of the Republic would be annihilated, and that democracy shall flourish under her watchful eye. While most of the chamber reacted to her speech with cheers and applause, very strangely, some of the Deputies with closer ties to Stalina were reported to have looks of worry on their face. Whatever the reaction is, however, there is no doubt about it - the Republic has a new leader, ready to steer the country to greatness."
 NIK.28.a:0 "Let's see how she does."
 
 NIK.2800.t:0 "Voznesensky Endures!"
 NIK.2800.d:0 "Voznesensky, stoic, gazes blankly at the roof of the chamber. Here was a man disgraced by his own comrades. Here was a man who had lost his sense of morality. Here was Nikolai Voznesensky, leader of democracy in Komi - but, perhaps, not for much longer. The party will decide his fate.\n\n"The time has now come to vote on confidence in comrade Voznesensky's leadership. If you are in favor of comrade Voznesensky, please raise your hand now."As the hands were raised, some politicians glanced at each other. Whispers broke out within the legislative groups, and worried looks appeared on faces throughout the room. Voznesensky perked up, his eyes narrowed and his heart pounding.\n\nMore amount of hands were showing than he thought. Perhaps even half of the chamber!\n\n"And... if you are in favor of removing comrade Voznesensky from his position of power, raise your hands."The Deputy in charge of counting was perplexed. The margin was very narrow, but it seems no one voted twice... and democracy was democracy.\n\n"Nikolai Voznesensky... by a vote of one hundred and three to ninety-seven, you have been declared still fit to hold this position of office..."Uproar immediately broke out throughout the chamber, only silenced by the incessant banging of the gavel. Voznesensky felt weak. Somehow... he was still the President. Even though by a thread, loyalty and confidence in him was still present. Nikolai resolved himself. His job was to lead the Republic. And so, he will."
 NIK.2800.a:0 "How does he survive?"

 NIK.29.t:0 "Discrediting the Leakers"
 NIK.29.d:0 "Overwhelming firepower. That's how we'll destroy these leaks. If the damned Germans were able to destroy the Union with it, I'd say it would work well here."\n\nThe meeting continued on after that suggestion, but it seemed no other idea resonated as greatly. The leaks had damaged the democratic party's reputation, and fast solutions were needed in order to try to stop the ship from completely sinking. A giant media blitz is proposed as the answer - the propaganda machine will never stop turning, and it must not stop - otherwise, the leaks may doom our chances of survival.\n\nEach and every leak will be analyzed and discredited, providing some sort of evidence that the document contains falsities and lies. And so, we shall churn out our great campaign - to defend democracy. Of course, some may say that all these fact-checks are untrue, even within our own party... but these naysayers wouldn't want their own files to be left out of the analyzation process, after all. All will be in agreement."
 NIK.29.a:0 "Truth? It does not matter."

 NIK.30.t:0 "The Party Fades"
 NIK.30.d:0 "The analyst looked, and looked again. No matter how many times he analyzed the figures, success was simply not there. The discrediting process was supposed to work, wasn't it? They said this was a bright idea... and yet these numbers say otherwise. Should he burst the bubble? He thought about it a bit. Despite his fearfulness of consequences, he figured that the party deserves to know the truth - no matter what it says. He called his supervisor over and showed him the paper.\n\n"We have a problem. This poll given to us by an analyst shows our support is dropping. Not by a lot, mind you, but still enough to be concerning. I've already fired him, of course, but it is still something we have to pay attention to."The meeting attendants looked at each other with an amount of worry. Voznesensky, the chair of the meeting, responded back."These numbers do not show anything significant. It is indeed a temporary setback, but it's not like the Germans are invading Syktyvkar. We will debate how to fix this - if you all believe that it needs to be fixed - in a legislative debate tomorrow. Meeting adjourned. Stop wasting my time with this crap.""
 NIK.30.a:0 "A small price to pay."

 NIK.31.t:0 "The Popularity Debate"
 NIK.31.d:0 "As the gavel banged and the session began, all eyes shifted to the candidates selected for debating the course of action on the declining poll numbers, and what to do to fix them. With each party in the coalition all holding their own positions on what to do in this situation, the debate was guaranteed to be a long and intense one. Each candidate, as per debate custom in the chamber, was asked to begin with an opening statement describing what they would do to fix the declining support of the democratic party among the people.\n\n"The fact that we are having this debate at all is a sign that the party has become full of worriers and defeatists," the social-democratic candidate begins. "Numbers like these go up and down all the time. One dip does not mean we must make a crisis out of it. Next person, please."\n\n"Democracy is a fragile beast." Kosygin comments. "It is constantly under siege from those who wish to destroy it. Radicalism is the enemy of our republic, and only God may know what these radicals will do if they are granted access to our leadership positions. We must not allow concessions to these fascists and communists in order to preserve our homeland from hatred and authoritarianism. That's all."\n\nIt took barely a second for Stalina to reply in kind, staring down at the audience. "Thank you. Kosygin is correct that we must safeguard ourselves against the radicals. However, not all of the radicals are unshakable in their beliefs. I believe that if we speak to the more democratic socialists, for example, and the less authoritarian rightists, we may be able to draw them into support for democracy, and thus, our numbers go up. My statement is done."\n\nAs the figures began their debate, the observers watched with interest, some taking notes. However, they could only choose one winner of the debate. They believed that..."
 NIK.31.a:0 "Voznesensky is correct."

 NIK.32.d:0 "As the debate concluded and the regular - albeit mandatory - applause filled the room, the democratic delegates were asked to select a 'winner' of the debate on slipping popularity numbers.\n\n"Comrades of this assembly. Now is the time to count these votes, and determine the actions of this party in regards to the numbers crisis."\n\n"By a margin of thirty-five, Comrade Voznesensky's plan...""Or rather, the lack of one,"he muttered under his breath, "...has been passed."\n\nVoznesensky's ideas were simple. If there is no action needed, there is no problem. Polls are simply that: polls. The numbers will always move back and forth, and there is no reason to assume that this will change. If the nature of the polls do not change, then there is no reason to change anything. And after all, if there is no action needed, there is no problem. Democracy would go on, and Komi would be blessed by the continued rule of the democratic party. All from not overreacting to one stupid poll."

Please cast your votes."\n\n"By a margin of forty-seven, Comrade Kosygin's plan has been passed."\n\nKosygin is a man who was determined to defend democracy. In his view, Komi can only be saved if the enemies of democracy were to be struck down before the radicals could strike and destroy the foundation of the republic. Anti-radical measures will be passed, further democratic-oriented "citizen's informational media"will be published and spread, and certain orders will be given to paramilitaries in order to secure the democratic control of republican-aligned districts. Each and every method needed to safeguard democracy will be applied, with full effort and full power behind it. And the republic would be saved."

Decide and cast your vote now..."\n\nThe delegate's inflection was one of uncertainty. "The leader of the vote, by... a margin of twelve, is... Comrade Belozerov?"He couldn't hide the confusion from his face.\n\nNo matter what the reaction was to his plan, Belozerov was one to stick to it. In his view, while radicals on both sides of the spectrum were a threat to democracy, his belief was that the leftist socialists and communists would be much harder to defeat. The only way to break them was to work together with the right. With his negotiations, Belozerov can cause the right to ally with him, thus having enough influence and power in order to take down the left. This would drastically improve democratic poll numbers, and would also secure democracy against the leftist threat. Once the leftist threat was defeated, Komi would be free."

Please vote for the candidate you agreed for the most. And not the person you would die for, please."While the last part was whispered to himself, the voting process commenced.\n\n"By a margin of forty, Comrade Stalina's plan will be put into motion."\n\nSvetlana Stalina is a rational woman. While she believes that democracy will always have its hardcore opponents, she also knows that some of those who simply question democracy may be convinced, through certain methods, to reconcile with the democratic party. Stalina's plan involves less harsh anti-radical measures than Kosygin's, and also tries to recapture those who are closer to democracy back. Polarization will be stopped, and the poll numbers will return to normal - maybe even higher - levels. Under her hand, democracy shall reach salvation."

 NIK.36.t:0 "A Message from Zhdanov"
 NIK.36.d:0 "The letter was a simple message. Near the Gribnoy Pereulok, eleven thirty in the evening - sharp. Bring a briefcase. Comrade Zhdanov. Voznesensky scratched his head. Sure, meetings were secret between the two - that much was obvious. His briefcase, however, he would have to find. But that shouldn't take too long...\n\nLights were scarce in these troubled times for Syktyvkar. There were enough aerial problems in the day, after all. The imposing silhouette of the Gribnoy Pereulok shadowed over the dark alley he was assigned to meet him at. Right on cue, a figure shows. Comrade Zhdanov has arrived.\n\nThe conversation was short. "I have for you something that might be of interest to the democratic party. Take these."He shows Voznesensky why he needed the briefcase: papers, and plenty of them. All stamped with the seal of the Communist Party of Komi."
 NIK.36.a:0 "You're welcome... comrade?"

 NIK.37.t:0 "Taking the Internal Files"
 NIK.37.d:0 "Zhdanov glances at Voznesensky as the papers ruffle and shake to the movement of the breeze. The leader of the Republic did not hesitate as he took the files and inspected them. The first document, however, did not promise much. It was essentially a list of names of important, non-rank and file members within the Communist Party, something already known to him. Was this intelligence junk? Other papers were in the pile, of course, but if the first document that was shown to him was obvious information, then hopes were minimal that the rest of them were any better. On the other hand, these files were still important pieces of information, even if copies or already deducted. Surely, keeping backups would be important..."
 NIK.37.a:0 "What could go wrong?"
 NIK.37.b:0 "We've seen this one before..."

 NIK.38.t:0 "The Informational Arsenal"
 NIK.38.d:0 "Walking to his residence, Voznesensky swung his briefcase in his dominant hand. While these files were probably still worthless, it was good to check anyways; they can be used as future reference quite well. As the man went to his home, he stopped at the door and put down the briefcase containing the files. Another stack to put in the archives, he supposed.\n\nLighting the house and, out of paranoia, checking to see if anyone was peering at him, Voznesensky set down the case and opened it. As he saw and, perhaps expected, the first file was something already known: a name list of important figures of the Communist Party of Komi. No specialities. Settling himself in for a long night of bureaucracy, he flipped to the next page - an inventory of armaments in a depot outside of Syktyvkar. Blinking, he almost went to the next page before he stopped himself. He stared at the page - was this a prank? Was this even official? Yet... there was the seal of the Communist Party, and a stamp that marked it as top secret. This information wasn't junk.\n\nIt was a goldmine.\n\nQuickly flipping to the next page, wondering if it was new or old, he saw the title. 'Operatives Monitoring Democratic Activities:' This was certainly new, and was also a small shock. Why would Zhdanov...? No matter! Voznesensky had the tools he needed now to defeat the left: their names and weapons, cataloged and able to be weaponized to the fullest extent. He dialed a number on his telephone and rang - "Grigorenko. Come to my house immediately. I have something that might be of interest to you.""
 NIK.38.a:0 "Perfection!"

 NIK.39.t:0 "Better than the Others"
 NIK.39.d:0 "Voznesensky thought about what Zhdanov was offering him. Sure, they were internal files of the Communist Party of Komi. But Zhdanov was not a man who he completely trusted. And considering that the first file was nothing but already-known junk, he did not have high hopes for the rest of them. Even if they were files that revealed damaging information, what would he be then? Just another plotter in the shadows? Komi has enough of those already. He would become another Gumilyov, or Suslov, and his followers would be known as Voznesenskyites to even his own party. He knew that a couple of old and worthless files was not worth losing party unity for. No matter how he put it, there was no way to justify taking these documents.\n\n"Zhdanov, comrade. I apologize, but there is no point in me taking these documents. They do not help me at all. Thank you for your consideration."He awaited Zhdanov's next words."
 NIK.39.a:0 "Thanks, but no thanks."

 NIK.40.t:0 "Suslov's Secrets"
 NIK.40.d:0 "Voznesensky looked over at the document with a stone-cold expression. Next to him was Petro Grigorenko, his paramilitary commander, and Vyasheslav Malyshev, his security minister. All three of them were discussing the documents that had been seen so far, with only two left to go over together. Already, orders had been sent to paramilitaries around the Republic to prepare for seizure and securing of Communist assets, and appropriate arrests had been carried out in secret. The spoils of these documents had almost been fully reaped, and it seemed that all was almost finished in action.\n\n"Malyshev, Grigorenko. These two documents and we're finished. Let's see what else is in this pile."The second-to-last document was unearthed from the stack of papers: a long-term operational plan ordered by and carried out by Svetlana Bukharin, one of Suslov's lieutenants. After a coup of the democratic government, the operation states that the Communist party would expand its territory to other warlord states nearby, eventually taking over much of the old Union."\n\nThe three men glanced at each other before reading the next document: a conversation between Boris Ponomaryov, a key figure on the left, and Suslov. After reading the document, which seemed more like Suslov giving orders to his inferior, the three men discussed it.\n\nFollowing their discussion, they agreed to gather the briefcase and guard it in a secure place, where none could see the machinations inside."
 NIK.40.a:0 "A treasure worth any price."

 NIK.41.t:0 "A Plan Foiled?"
 NIK.41.d:0 "Zhdanov looked over at Voznesensky, retracting his hand and putting the documents away. The two men locked eyes, yet Voznesensky did not see the Zhdanov he usually saw. Avoiding eye contact and looking around, Zhdanov muttered out a few words, perhaps of gratitude, or of regret - but Voznesensky could not tell - and slowly backed away from him. Was Zhdanov planning something, and his plot was now defeated before it even started? Did Zhdanov want to sabotage his party and he stopped it from happening? Could he possibly be even hurt emotionally by the rejection - a close friend betraying him?\n\nAs Zhdanov quietly phased out into the darkness, Voznesensky was left alone with the stars to contemplate."
 NIK.41.a:0 "Perhaps we'll never know."

 NIK.42.t:0 "Zhdanov's Favor"
 NIK.42.d:0 "A little after the clock struck twelve did the call come in. Voznesensky grabbed it with no haste, expecting yet another legislative matter, or perhaps an associate clearing up a request. Repayment was not on his mind, however, when he picked up the phone.\n\n"Comrade Voznesensky, this is Andrei! I hope you have obtained the material and kept it safely."Voznesensky didn't expect the call, but that was fine. A small chat with Zhdanov about the materials, in fact, would be a wise thing to do. "Indeed, I have! Thank you, Comrade Zhdanov. Now, our meeting-"He was interrupted by Zhdanov's next words. "Ah, Nikolai, yes, our meeting. Speaking of that, did you think that I would just give you the documents for free, old friend?" Voznesensky was silent after that, wondering just what he signed up for. "You see, Nikolai, there is a certain organization that has been talking to me. They say that they are being hunted down by your paramilitaries, in fact, and would very much not like to be hunted down by your paramilitaries. Now, Voznesensky, I am aware that you do have the power to fix this, correct? And that I also expect to see it fixed. The All-Komi League of Socialism and Communism would love to know they can sleep safely at night. Thank you, Nikolai."Before Voznesensky had a chance to reply back with any word, Zhdanov hung up. Now it was his turn to fulfill the end of the bargain."
 NIK.42.a:0 "Do we have a choice?"

 NIK.43.t:0 "The Chaos Increases"
 NIK.43.d:0 "The irregular sound of pistol shots and yelling helped set the tone for the meeting. Voznesensky, Malyshev, Grigorenko, and all of their associates were discussing the latest news: an uptick in street violence between left-wing and right-wing paramilitaries. Since more blood had been spilled onto the streets, the democratic party has been conducting meetings between them and their paramilitaries to see what should be done about this situation.\n\n"This is the perfect opportunity!"Grigorenko yelled, slamming his fist on the table in a display of masochism. "These idiots are fulfilling their blood lust against each other, and draining their numbers! If we go out into the streets now, then we should be able to destroy them all!""Why the hell should we risk injuring our fine men if they're injuring each other already?"Voznesensky replied back. "They'll just start using more drastic methods, maybe even killing each other. No need to deploy anything.""You two, as usual, assume that we have to do either everything to stop them, or nothing to stop them. Have you ever considered simply helping move the process along? Escalating the situation? Do certain actions and blame them on the opposing ideology? Strike from the shadows? These are the kind of things we need to do in order to succeed. Think about it."\n\nAs the screaming and the gunshots continued, the meeting wrapped up, a decision finally being reached."
 NIK.43.a:0 "One should not interrupt their enemy in the process of making a mistake."
 NIK.43.b:0 "Send them in, mop them up."
 NIK.43.c:0 "We shall be everywhere and nowhere."

 NIK.44.t:0 "No Need to Panic"
 NIK.44.d:0 "Huddled civilians cried and cowered in the shop. Outside were dead bodies, two associated with the left and five associated with the right. Blood stained the street and sidewalk, glass and weapons lying at the feet of the deceased. A new era of chaos in the streets and towns of Komi rules over the republic now.\n\nVoznesensky smirked at the news of the most recent confrontation, this time resulting in an unusually high amount of deaths. He was right after all - there was no course of action required. Now, they are killing each other directly in the streets, when before they had only injured each other. The process is happening even quicker than he thought. Soon, the problem would be eradicated completely as the paramilitaries wipe each other out. He sat back in his chair, enjoying the supremacy of his decisions. Nothing to worry about from here on out."
 NIK.44.a:0 "The problem solves itself."

 NIK.45.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.45.d:0 "Voznesensky did not see the changing of the situation at first. It was a slow process, a slogging ordeal for both combatants that left some dead and many more injured on both sides alike. But now, reports have come in from the democratic paramilitaries and the citizens of Komi. More and more, the injured and killed come from the right-wing paramilitaries - they appear more scared as they go to fight, less of Gumilyov's men show up to confront the leftist forces, and Gumilyov himself has been rumored to be in a state of disarray following a decisive defeat in Vilegodsk in which his forces have been completely driven out of the city.\n\nWhile fights are still ongoing in Syktyvkar, and the left-wing paramilitaries still suffer many casualties, it is now clear that the balance is tilting towards Suslov and his armies in the streets, which may prove to be a challenge in the future. But for now, Voznesensky pays it no mind. The right will come back from this minor setback, surely."
 NIK.45.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.46.t:0 "Red Stars on the Poll Booths"
 NIK.46.d:0 "He was blindsided by the news. He couldn't believe any of it. How were they able to do that? How...\n\nThe leftist radicals have declared victory in the streets. Following a particularly gruesome battle near the legislative building in Syktyvkar between Suslov's elite paramilitary unit and cobbled together volunteers of Gumilyov's forces, in which the winner was obvious, the rightist paramilitaries have showed up less and less. Gumilyov, for now, has been defeated in the paramilitary struggle, and although his forces fight on, none are sure he may ever be able to regain the strength he once had again.\n\nVoznesensky, upon hearing this, was about to burst into one of his characteristic tyrades when another piece of news hit: voters were now being intimidated by these paramilitaries. Electoral districts have shifted control from more democratic-leaning to fully leftist-leaning, and some communists have even had the audacity to graffiti red stars onto the polling booths, letting all who vote know who is nearby. Shifting, wanting to speak, wanting to explode onto the news bringer violently, he found that he couldn't. Wearily sighing, he simply waved the courier out of his room."
 NIK.46.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.47.t:0 "Embracing the Moderates"
 NIK.47.d:0 "The poll numbers are up, for once."Yet another meeting, yet another piece of news. At least this piece of news was pleasant. Voznesensky blinked and asked him to explain how this could happen when the radicals were about to stage their 'fair' election victory.\n\n"According to... well, a survey, yes, I know it's a survey, but just stick with me. According to that survey, many of them are people who are newly supportive of democracy. It seems after the violence was started by the radicals of both the left and the right, the moderates of both wings became terrified that they would be targeted both by the enemy and within their own ideology. Thus, they now flee to us for their safety and protection."\n\nVoznesensky was at least glad that he might have a chance of surviving these next elections. Speaking some token words of approval he couldn't bother to remember, the meeting carried on."
 NIK.47.a:0 "Something good comes out of this."

 NIK.48.t:0 "The Shifting Tides"
 NIK.48.d:0 "The changing of the balance was something unnoticed at first. Yet, as time continued on, something seemed more apparent. Rumors were that Suslov had been showing up less and less to his meetings. The battles have gotten bloodier, the left-wing in particular becoming more desperate in their fighting methods. Apparently, the left-wing paramilitaries are being beaten back on the streets, with some fighting apparently even happening in fully communist-controlled areas.\n\nVoznesensky fidgeted at the news. While he knew that fighting would still go on for a long while, as the left is very equipped and powerful, it did not ease him to know that the right wing, with Gumilyov at the helm, is growing ever-more powerful in the outside world, away from the chambers of power. However, Voznesensky had faith in the left-wing paramilitaries. Surely, they will beat Gumilyov back, and kill each other. Surely."
 NIK.48.a:0 "Concerning..."

 NIK.49.t:0 "Springtime for Gumilyov?"
 NIK.49.d:0 "Voznesensky could not believe what he heard. How was this possible? How did they do it? How...\n\nIn the streets of Syktyvkar and the small towns of the republic, the rightist paramilitaries are supreme. After an intense and hard-fought battle between Suslov's reservists and Gumilyov's elite, SS-modelled bodyguards, of which the winner was clear, the leftist paramilitaries have retreated from the streets, only showing up to protect certain key electoral districts and influential leftist figures. Although Suslov fights on, and with still much power to eventually wreak havoc on the right, Gumilyov has gained the advantage in the battle of Komi.\n\nVoznesensky began to cuss out the poor courier when he realized something. If Gumilyov has already taken control of several communist districts, that means he is very much able to intimidate voters in those districts, as well as democratic districts. In a 'fair' vote, Voznesensky would be defeated. Cursing out the carrier as much as he could, he knew that the end could be near for him."
 NIK.49.a:0 "How could it have gotten so far?"

 NIK.50.t:0 "Peace through Superior Firepower"
 NIK.50.d:0 "Grigorenko grinned as he saw the beautiful T-34. An old relic of the wars of Russia, yet still an effective killing machine, the commander was proud to say that this tank was now part of his paramilitary - and would drive the radicals out.\n\nWhen Voznesensky approved, reluctantly, Grigorenko's suggestion for equipping and sending out his paramilitaries to fight, he immediately went to work on preparing his forces for the battles ahead. New drills with new rifles. New tanks to crush the Suslovites and the Gumilyovites with. New powers to destroy the enemies of democracy.\n\nAs the orders were given to begin engaging fascist and communist paramilitaries, Grigorenko personally led his forces to the streets of Syktyvkar, ready to fight. Ready to win."
 NIK.50.a:0 "Do us proud."

 NIK.51.t:0 "A Cordial Request"
 NIK.51.d:0 "Voznesensky's work was interrupted when one of his secretaries entered his office. The stocky man nodded toward his boss and wordlessly made his way to the desk. "From Zhdanov "was his underling's only comment. Voznesensky did not bother to look up from the memo as the secretary closed the door behind him.\n\nZhdanov's message was polite. The cordial word to the president of the Republic succinctly made a case for the end of targeted paramilitary campaigns against the communists. For reasons of military security as well as to prevent radical elements from destabilizing the left. It would not do, after all, for communist citizens in Komi to see the government turn its back on them. Nor would it do any good to have brave communist soldier gunned down by the government.\n\nVoznesensky's eyes were still on the memo when his underling brought his afternoon tea. Deep in reflection, the politician thanked his secretary, but did not lift his eyes off the message."
 NIK.51.a:0 "Why would we?"
 NIK.51.b:0 "Let's try it, at least."
 
 NIK.52.t:0 "A Propaganda Surge!"
 NIK.52.d:0 "A leaflet among many, distributed it in mass the last few weeks. "Where were you citizens, when the bourgeois government made open its ties to fascists and reactionaries?"\n\nThe leaflet fluttered down the street. The wind's whimsy brought it under a new propaganda poster. A brutish soldier stood poised to stab worker militiamen from behind. From the soldier's shadow, a twin hydra of fascism and conservatism. "The so called democrats have always been threats to the worker's revolution. End the massacre of brave communist patriots! "\n\nAfter admiring his printers' handywork, Zhdanov rolled up the window of his car and asked his chauffeur to drive on. Better stay off the streets in these troubled times."
 NIK.52.a:0 "Damnation!"
 
 NIK.53.t:0 "Suspicions within the Party"
 NIK.53.d:0 "The population did not know why the violent campaign against the communists had started. Neither did they know why it had ended suddenly.\n\nReports coming in from the democratic party made it clear that the general population's confusion was replaced in the government by dismay. Internal memos trying to assess where the order had come from. Centrist Apparatchik apparently clued in rapidly that the order had come from the top, and a few ill advised conversation over drinks had been dutifully recorded by Suslov's men. Suspicions that Voznesensky had capitulated to the left were corroborated with a few bribes given to key military men of the regime. Making sure of loyalty in tough times? Many governmental paramilitaries would have been incensed to see their prize taken away.\n\nSuslov read the final report before neatly adding it to the pile. The socialist leader was intrigued by the whirlwind of violence and capitulation. He pondered if Zhdanov had made himself useful for once, and stopped the violence against the left. Only time would tell."
 NIK.53.a:0 "Another trap!"
 
 NIK.54.t:0 "Silver Bullet Holes"
 NIK.54.d:0 "A fresh crop of political violence was harvested today in Komi as the headquarters of several radical paramilitaries of all political affiliations began burning down today. The string of fires broke out in a rapid succession, overwhelming Komi's fire department. The buildings had not yet stopped smouldering before manifestations broke out against the arsonists. The protests turned ugly when the crowd could not determined who had really been behind it. In between helping with the fires and quelling riots, quite a few law enforcement officials lost their lives to the chaos. Their funerals will run concurrently with those of a range of paramilitary leaders and soldiers, lost to the blaze and smoke. Ordinary citizens of Syktyvkar have not been spared, for fire and hatred both spread easily in such a large city."
 NIK.54.a:0 "The only upside..."
 
 NIK.55.t:0 "The Smoke and Mirrors"
 NIK.55.d:0 "Pyotr Grigorenko is a man with a plan. In his city, thugs and drifters with no clear ambition join paramilitaries and look for the fight of their life. Why not provide it to them?\n\nIt would, of course, not do for an officer of the democratic government to be seen running around with paramilitary types. This is why Grigorenko does not advertise much his status as head of one of the biggest militias that backs the government. But his slow acquisition of soldiers of fortune and desperados has not been for nothing. Now the time comes to let some steam off Komi's fragile military apparatus.\n\nGrigorenko's men have begun a mass campaign of violence against the far left and far right. Much creative efforts have gone into his little project. Fascist leaders are found killed in the communist's favorite fashion. A stolen truck of the far right is filled with explosives and parked close to a communist meeting. Through all this, governmental soldiers associated with the extremes are found mysteriously dead. As the city descends into chaos, the extremists are likely to assume the useless centrist government is unable to protect them. Why not take action into their own hands, after all? From this initial wave of false flag attack, the good officer hopes to see the radicals throw one another in a mass grave of their own making. After all, it would not be proper for the government to be involved in such untidy violence."
 NIK.55.a:0 "Could it even work?"
 
 NIK.56.t:0 "A Bloodless Victory"
 NIK.56.d:0 "The inferno of political street fighting in Komi has begun to peter out. The far right and far left have run out of angry men with weapons. Dead, wounded or in despair about the loss of so many comrades to violence, members of various paramilitaries have begun pushing on their bosses for a temporary ceasefire. The thug's urge to turn swords into plowshare is probably helped by the complete stalemate. There appears to be no clear winner between the far right and far left, for all radical paramilitaries have been bloodied in the conflict. Temporary gains have inevitably turned into disastrous losses as the cycle of revenge went on. Militia men that had one day been struggling to carry their loot had been found dead in alleyways the next day.\n\nOne side, however, has made it through unsscathed. The government's men, both in the army and off it, have been strangely uninvolved in the conflagration. As a result, few men of the centre have seen their military careers cut violently short. Where once it seemed inevitable to see extremists overwhelm the government, now the centrists hold a fair share of the balance of power."

 NIK.57.d:0 "Stalina's office was tucked away in a distant corner of the building. This suited her, for few party members or employee ever wandered into her room by mistake. All the better to lose herself in thinking.\n\nLike her boss Voznesensky she liked to keep a clean office. In Komi, a small bubble of relative stability had been established from the Russian Anarchy. Her office's peace and quiet was to the rest of the governmental building a microcosm of what Komi should be to the rest of Russia. Could be.\n\nThe light flickered. The woman looked briefly to her small collection of candles. They were useful to keep around; a full day's worth of electricity was a rare treat in modern Russia.\n\nHer office was peaceful and orderly. The militias and paramilitaries made Komi a right mess. But how to get rid of them? Their leader kept the men on a short leash, lean and angry and looking for a scrap. It would probably not be too difficult to push the men over the edge and into open conflict. The small fries were never told why exactly they fought the men they fought; only when to strike. In this situation, perhaps a set of false flag attack might cause the rank and file to pressure their leaders for vengeance and retribution? Keeping angry, violent men on such a short leash was a double edged sword. The promise of violence led to expectations of violence.\n\nIn the shadows of Komi lurked radicals, idiots willing to invite the violence of the Russian Anarchy to Komi. The guardians of orders would need to invite violence in kind. No mercy for the enemies of stability."
 NIK.57.a:0 "Useful, someday."
 
 NIK.58.t:0 "Svetlana's Theories"
 NIK.58.d:0 "Voznesensky often wandered the halls of his party's edifice to stretch his legs. Every now and then, the president of the republic saw his steps bring him to the door of one particular staircase. That way lay the path to Stalina's office. A strange location for the rising star of Komi's democratic politics. But the young woman had politely refused to move to a better office. Perhaps she treasured her peace and quiet ?\n\nQuiet, Voznesensky had accepted he would have very little off when he became head of the young republic. Peace, on the other hand, he desperately craved. Each day brought in new problems. Schemes, intrigues, plots, manipulations. It drained him to keep track of the cards in play, and of the players holding them. This was in addition of his role as head of state. Keeping the economy chugging along, managing foreign policy, sifting through reports on the closest Russian warlords. He had very little time to make his own moves. Neither did Kosygin. Busy with keeping the nation afloat, the democrats could do little against the extremist's schemes.\n\nVoznesensky found his hand on the door's handle. A flight of stairs. A corridor. A knock on the young woman's door. Another request. Another confident smile and nod.\n\nSvetlana Stalina's had arrived in Komi with nothing. She had fallen in love at first sight with her new home. The young woman loved Komi's stability, its order, its promise of progress. The radicals she hated with a passion. In them she saw echoes of the failed Soviet Union, of the evil fascist power that had plunged Russia in anarchy. She had joined the democrats in their efforts, and her intelligence, charisma and work ethics had charmed many. Others feared her and her own brand of radicalism. No amount of bloodshed would be too great for Komi. To party members tired of political violence she proposed a wave of terror to end all terrors.\n\nVoznesensky remained at the top of the stairs. He knew not if he wanted to go down."

 NIK.59.d:0 "Voznesensky shrugged off his fatigue. Stalina had been nothing but loyal, trustworthy asset, he though as he went down the stairs. To the spin doctors of the far right and far left, the democrats had struggled to find answer. Now Stalina led the charge at the head of a new generation of democratic politicians. Men and women unable to accept the death of a free and stable Komi without fighting.\n\nHer radicalism and influence were of course points of contention. But as long as they were well monitored, Voznesensky had in the young woman in indispensable ace in the hole. His support for her would of course need to be well calibrated, to avoid upsetting Stalina's detractor within the centrist coalition. But every decision in Komi required careful calibration anyway.\n\nA knock on his underling's door. "Yes, you can enter."The president did so. "Ahh, Nikolai. I wanted to discuss with you."The older politician smiled. "Fancy dinner? We can catch up over some food.""Only if you pay, Comrade President.""
 NIK.59.a:0 "Let's hope there's no backlash."
 
 NIK.60.t:0 "A Victory For Internal Affairs"
 NIK.60.d:0 "The president continued his walk. Useful as she may be, the rising star of the party still had to be reined in. Schemes and plots that went outside the knowledge of the party higher ups was an especially big no-no. Voznesensky was quite certain that his underling's plan was targeted at the extremists, fair and square. But no one knew how far she would go. And Voznesensky had not stayed in the business for so long without learning never to give out blank cheques.\n\nLater, over dinner he wrote out a few memos. The party whip in particular he needed to meet. Stalina would receive an official warning. Heaven knew that it might not be enough to stop her. But it might at least serve as a cold shower on her ambition by signalling to her that the party was watching."
 NIK.60.a:0 "We should calm her down some."
 
 NIK.61.t:0 "Suslov Rampant"
 NIK.61.d:0 "As the conflict between the centrist government and the far right militia escalates, troubling news are spreading from several areas of Syktyvkar. As the violence has spread to several sectors held by the far right, areas of the city held by the far left have seen unusual activity. Many communist militias have moved into the open, aggressively pursuing protection money from new businesses. In effect, the left wing has expanded the size of its operations in formerly neutral or right wing sectors. Several political manifestations supporting the far left have applied increased pressure on the government, profiting from its inability to respond.\n\nSomewhere in the great game of Komi intrigue, Suslov must be smiling contentedly. A great deal of his activities are now going unchallenged, as his opponents are busy with one another."
 NIK.61.a:0 "Damnation!"
 
 NIK.62.t:0 "A Reconstruction Government?"
 NIK.62.d:0 "Secret meetings are part and parcel of political life in Komi. Yet it takes a special set of circumstances for the absolute highest level of security to be deployed. Deep in the chamber of the coalition's headquarters, with only a handpicked few bodyguards as witnesses, the leaders of the three democratic parties as well as Vice-President Rodionov have agreed to a meeting with the democratic coalition's rising star.\n\nIt did not take long for the cat to come out of the bag. Svetlana Stalina directly brought up the subject; Komi's republic is in a bad shape. With extremist faction sharpening their knives, not long remains before the political system is judged obsolete and powerful forces try to unseat it. The best and only option is thus to strike first. By suspending democracy and marshaling all of the state's power, the center can hold off extremism and maintain a reconstruction government until the coast is clear. From this initial statement, the meeting went on..."
 NIK.62.a:0 "Perhaps we can do it... if needed."
 NIK.62.b:0 "This is too far."
 
 NIK.63.t:0 "Considerations"
 NIK.63.d:0 "The three heads of Komi's moderate political parties have had plenty of experience with keeping a good poker face. Even so, Stalina's daring proposal has set in motion many sets of gears inside the four men's head. Outwardly, however, the conversation has seen little more than questions about the details of Stalina's plan. A few token objections have been raised, to test the young woman's ideas. In the end, of a common accord the three party leaders agreed that the proposal had merit, and requested more time to consider the issue. Vice president Rodionov silently approved Voznesensky's proposal. Stalina agreed, satisfied with her progress. The daring proposal might have impressed some of the three men about her growing confidence. Perhaps a reshuffling of the political landscape might be on her horizon?"
 NIK.63.a:0 "Placated, for now."
 
 NIK.64.t:0 "A Meeting on the Side"
 NIK.64.d:0 "Some time after the meeting, the replies started to trickle into Stalina's mailbox. First came the social democrats; Voznesensky and Rodionov seemed the least enthused about the Reconstruction Government of the four. Then came the conservative leader's answer. After many circular reasonings, the man did not reveal much of his thoughts, and thus his opinion remained to be determined. Kosygin's reply was very different. He communicated through intermediaries a request to Stalina for a private meeting.\n\nKeeping a secret from one's own political allies can be as difficult as hiding it from enemies. Yet in a remote spot of the republic, the two politicians managed to meet. The leader of the liberals confided to Stalina his concern about the security situation. If the time came for such a drastic measure, Kosygin would support the young politician's proposal."
 NIK.64.a:0 "Perhaps a new approach is feasible after all."
 
 NIK.65.t:0 "Zhdanovite Connections Revealed!"
 NIK.65.d:0 "Kosygin often found his cabinet had devolved back into a mess of shuffled papers and documents. He was not fond of letting his secretaries clean it, and so once a week he began the task of reordering everything.\n\nIn between a report on the agricultural sector's output in the last few years and a memoranda about the state of highway funding was a strange unmarked letter. The leader of the liberals absentmindedly opened it. His heart skipped a beat; addressed to him by name, the letter described itself as "coming from a friend". Its content preposterously claimed to prove that President Voznesensky was a paid plant for Zhdanov.\n\nKosygin folded the letter back and slid it inside his breast pocket. His secretaries were used to see their boss tear off on some errand without informing them. The politician walked through the building, eventually reaching the quiet section where Stalina's office was.\n\nThe young politician was shocked to see Kosygin break his own rules about meeting one another in public. Her surprise only grew when he passed to her wordlessly an envelope."
 NIK.65.a:0 "A traitor at the very top...?"
 
 NIK.66.t:0 "Beginning the Investigation"
 NIK.66.d:0 "The origin of the tip off remained a secret. Verifying the proof's truth was thus a difficult proposal. But the seeds of doubt remained in Stalina and Kosygin's mind. Rumors of an improper friendship between Zhdanov and President Voznesensky cropped every now and then in Komi's wild world of political speculations. A few remembered how both men had been associates in the murky past of the WRRF days, despite their later falling out over political differences. The allegation of modern financial and political links was a very serious one that needed proper investigation.\n\nThe investigation would need to be secret, of course. How else would the ties between a communist leader of the opposition and the president of the Republic be ascertained? Both men were too used to Komi's political scene to be sloppy about any relationship. If news came out of this secret investigation, the president would deny everything. Stalina and Kosygin's career would likely never recover. Prudence was the order of the day."
 NIK.66.a:0 "Ask him for answers. Now."
 NIK.66.b:0 "There's no need for confrontation."
 
 NIK.67.t:0 "The Confrontation"
 NIK.67.d:0 "Another meeting in the depth of the ruling coalition's headquarters. Stalina, Rodionov, and Kosygin sat across President Voznesensky's seat. The social democrat politician chuckled something about not expecting to be thrown in front of the inquisition. Silently, Stalina pushed a manilla folder across the table. The President's attempt at levity having failed, he accepted without comment the set of papers and began leafing through them.\n\nA slight frown creased his traits. Worry? Confusion? None of the assembled democratic politicians could decide. All awaited for Voznesensky's response."
 NIK.67.a:0 "Oh?"
 
 NIK.68.t:0 "A Stable Partnership"
 NIK.68.d:0 "The President began by thanking the assembled democrats for trusting him with this delicate matter. The consequences to the coalition's trust might have been incalculable if doubt had been allowed to fester. The horror of seeing trusted colleagues scheming behind his back in a protracted witch hunt could have spelled the end of the President's work in the coalition.\n\nThe proof in question, he went on to explain, was clever for it used confusing places in his finances and assets to create the illusion of an unexplained amount of missing money where corruption could have been present. If the assembled men and women could give him a few hours, all would be explained.\n\nA break was indeed called, and food brought down. Stalina exchanged a glance with Kosygin. The older man did not seem to know where all this was going either.\n\nIn the afternoon, a swathe of financial papers was presented. Kosygin slowly ascertained their accuracy. As it turned, the numbers really meshed. Stalina was the first to get up from her seat and reach over to the president to shake his hand. "Someone has tried to mislead us, and for that I apologize.". The president shook her hand."
 NIK.68.a:0 "Unsafe, certainly. Necessary, possibly."
 
 NIK.69.t:0 "The Conspiracy"
 NIK.69.d:0 "No hunter would just stroll into the open and announce to its prey that the hunt is on. The secret investigation that began as a project by Kosygin and Stalina has been carefully expanded to a trusted few liberal higher-ups. Sub-ministers within Stalina's growing, and accountants helping Kosygin on economic matters, as well as a few intelligence men with ties to both politicians. The goal is to expand the nets of a conspiracy to figure out if Voznesensky has been compromised. By comparing classified information available to a range of different governmental role with whatever intelligence can be found on the communist factions' inner workings. Hopefully a slip up can be used to crack open the case."
 NIK.69.a:0 "You made us do this, Nikolai."
 
 NIK.70.t:0 "Approaching the Left"
 NIK.70.d:0 "Stalina's affinity with the social demoratic party had seen her grow ever closer to many of its main players. Yet bringing up the accusation of improper final transactions by the party's leader and President of the Republic took a certain amount of prudence. The young politician requested a private meeting with Vice President Rodionov and a few trustworthy men of the Social Democrat party to share her information.\n\nThe meeting's atmosphere was electric. The men suspected a rare event for Stalina to summon such an illustrious group. The absence of the president spoke volume about the gravity of the situation.\n\nWith everyone gathered, Stalina arranged her papers and began the meeting."
 NIK.70.a:0 "Let's hope they're not compromised."
 
 NIK.71.t:0 "Our Cover Blown!"
 NIK.71.d:0 "Voznesensky knows!\n\nThe president casually brought up rumors of an internal party crisis to Kosygin. Voznesensky expressed dismay at the rumor, and said he had informed Kosygin first to make sure this mystery cabal would not train its attention on the Liberal Party's leader. Kosygin was shaken by the implied threat; it was he could to thank the president and vow assistance in ending this shadowy cabal.\n\nWho could have betrayed them? Suspicion fell on Vice President Rodionov, but Stalina pointed out how the logistics of it didn't make sense.\n\nThe president didn't know the full extent of things, but he certainly knew that eyes were trained on him. The secret investigation was perhaps running out of time."
 NIK.71.a:0 "Is nobody loyal? Bury this!"
 NIK.71.b:0 "Give it one last try. Come clean."
 
 NIK.72.t:0 "Burying the Dirt"
 NIK.72.d:0 "The best way forward was to kill the investigation and bury everything. Members of the investigation were cut out of the secret conspiracy one by one, with a combination of threats and promises ensuring they would keep the secret. A few expendable informants were moved out of the city for the time being. Financial information that had served as Kosygin's bedtime reading disappeared up the chimney.\n\n\n\nIt was all they could do. . . But as it turned out, it wasn't enough. The President diligently appraised his ally Kosygin of every bit of progress hunting down the secret conspiracy. The walls were closing in on Kosygin and Stalina."
 NIK.72.a:0 "May it never again arise."
 
 NIK.73.t:0 "Traitors to Democracy?"
 NIK.73.d:0 "Both partners in crimes stood in front of the higher ups of the democratic Coalition. Voznesensky spoke most often. He communicated his anger and dismay that the economist and the young politician had gone behind his back and instigated a witch hunt within the party. Had it spread, the damage to party unity might have been incalculable.\n\nBoth would be censured for their activity. As their intention had been to defend the coalition from possible infiltration, both culprits would be allowed to continue their political work. But from now on their work would be heavily monitored by members of the coalition.\n\nIn the panel of party activists censoring them, many former members of the conspiracy. What could they do? Stalina and Kosygin had cut them off to limit the damage. Anyone advocating mercy risked incurring Voznesensky's ire on their head. The two culprits would have to suffer in isolation."
 NIK.73.a:0 "Can Komi be saved?"
 
 NIK.74.t:0 "A Successful Ploy"
 NIK.74.d:0 "'And so, the contradictions of capitalism shall lead to a World War, bringing in the new phase of world socialism.'\n\nSuslov's theory has proven itself accurate. With his plot to tear the liberals apart by stoking paranoia through his agents, the center was already splitting into irrelevant chunks. With every trial and accusation coming out of the formerly ironclad "coalition for democracy", he had another reason to celebrate.\n\nYes, gumilyov, the esotericist madman, was still credible opposition, no matter how much he hated to say it. But Zhdanov had done his job well, and his attempt to seize power for himself by collaborating with the Voznesentsi had easily been twisted for the more... pure aims of the Revolution.\n\nOf course, he didn't know that Suslov was onto him. He wouldn't be punished... but perhaps a reminder was in order.\n\nYes, in the microcosm of the outside world that was Komi, the seeds of the Revolution had just been planted. All that remained to be done was finally break the opposition, and the red flag would fly once more."
 NIK.74.a:0 "Make it so."
 
 NIK.75.t:0 "The Confession"
 NIK.75.d:0 "Voznesensky and the party's whips were breathing down their necks. Time was running out. And so Kosygin decided to play the last good card he held in his rapidly shrinking deck.\n\nVoznesensky did not make a good show of looking surprised at Kosygin's request for a private meeting. When meeting the leader of the Liberals, the President of the Republic simply said "Well?"once both were alone. Kosygin sighed. The explanation would be painful. But living through the humiliation was perhaps their only way out. And so, Kosygin began to detail what he and Stalina had been up to."
 NIK.75.a:0 "Is it enough?"
 
 NIK.76.t:0 "The Leak Revealed"
 NIK.76.d:0 "The thought could initially be put aside by Kosygin. In the panic to save himself and Stalina from Voznesensky, the leader of the liberals did not have much interest in figuring out how exactly Stalina and him had seen their scheme revealed. After pulling aside the president and coming clean with his secret investigation, the leader of the liberals found himself with a lot of spare time as he waited to hear about his fate.\n\nIn this new abundance of free time, Kosygin's mind raced back to the cause of his trouble. How exactly had the president figured out the investigation team's activities, again? Voznesensky had made an offhand comment about one of his men's finding.\n\nSomething didn't add up, however. There was no way this particular informant could have known the details of the investigation that ended up in Voznesensky's hands. Perhaps then someone had forwarded the information to this man? Certainly not Zhdanov, for leaking his alliance with the President to the democratic coalition would lose him a great trump card. The far right might have known, but Kosygin didn't feel they were behind this. No, this particular man of Voznesensky's inner circle might in fact be a Suslov acquaintance. The other master of the far left would certainly be in a position to weaken his rival and the government all at once.\n\nKosygin called to his secretary. The others in the democratic coalition needed to hear of this theory, no matter what."
 NIK.76.a:0 "How is this possible?"
 
 NIK.77.t:0 "The Eye of the Enemy"
 NIK.77.d:0 "Voznesensky was understandably a little bit grouchy at being dragged out to a new meeting by an avowed traitor. Still, his political instincts, his friendship with Kosygin or something else convinced him to make the trip. Stalina was equally present, sitting by Kosygin's side, gazing sternly ahead.\n\nVoznesensky sat in silence as he listened to Kosygin's explanation. It did not take an expert on body language to see how troubled the President was by Kosygin's theory.\n\nKosygin was the first to break the silence. "So, a mysterious information drop reached you and Stalina, accusing the president of being a Zhanovite plant. And then, a new source of information alerted the president that his own party was rebellious." He nodded gravely. "If Suslov was behind the leak to the president, perhaps he was also behind the first leak to you and Stalina. If so, his infiltration of the party would need to be quite complete. Had I or president Voznesensky heard about information falling into your hands, the whole scheme would have broken down."\n\nTo these words, the three men and women fell silent. The implications were too catastrophic to discuss out loud."
 NIK.77.a:0 "Plots and maleficence, everywhere!"
 
 NIK.78.t:0 "Reigning in the Party"
 NIK.78.d:0 "Suslov walked a little easier these days. Even with his legion of spies in the government, it was never simple to determine why exactly the democratic parties did anything they did. Their leaders, although allies and mostly friendly to one another, jealousy hoarded their considerable personal influence. As a result it was a rare event for anyone to claim ownership of an unpopular policy such as ending the pressure on the far left.\n\nNo matter the cause, the end of the war on the far left let Suslov move more easily. Aggressive and ambitious underlings had pressured their boss to move violently against the government and far-right. Now that the bloodshed and propaganda war was over, a lot of Suslov's loyalists were free to crack some skulls and twist some arms to re-establish order. The fact he had calmly weathered the storm gave Suslov a lot of credibility, for now the left stood strong and the government appeared weak."
 NIK.78.a:0 "They will not fall to revisionism."
 
 NIK.79.t:0 "A Request for a Ceasefire"
 NIK.79.d:0 "The violent struggle between the government and the far left had left an opening for Gumilyov's scheme. Now the spectre of a far right take-over haunted Komi's young republic. Far-right paramilitaries had begun crawling out of their districts, moving into democratic and communist territories alike as the depleted manpower of both faction left them unable to oppose this take-over.\n\nIt was a risk for a face-to-face meeting to occur between Zhdanov and the president. But desperate hours called for desperate measures. Once both had reached the secluded meeting spot in the woods outside of Syktyvkar, Zhdanov requested his old friend an end to active hostilities between the government and the communists. Such a ceasefire would let both sides turn their attention to Gumilyov's imminent takeover attempt.\n\nThe president listened to Zhdanov's case without comment. Any question he asked might reveal information about the government's position. When the Communist leader finally fell silent, Voznesensky announced his intentions..."
 NIK.79.a:0 "He's gone too far."
 NIK.79.b:0 "Let's keep this between us..."
 
 NIK.80.t:0 "Refusing the Ceasefire"
 NIK.80.d:0 "The response was short, and polite. Voznesensky explained to Zhdanov that the government had no intention of ending the pressure on the communists.\n\nZhdanov excused himself and walked back to his bodyguards. The president watched his old friend being driven away, his expression indecipherable. Soon, he too had gone back to his bodyguards. His car soon drove off in the night."
 NIK.80.a:0 "There will be blood."
 
 NIK.81.t:0 "The Split Front"
 NIK.81.d:0 "Had there ever been a lull in the fighting? For the briefest of moments, the governmental and communist militias had stopped their clashes. Had it been fear at the rise of the far right militias? Or perhaps some inscrutable order from on top.\n\nThe lull, if it had ever existed, was shattered by a renewal of the violence. Both sides fought savagely. After all, only the extermination of the other would allow the victor to turn around to face the far right.\n\nSomewhere in Syktyvkar, Gumilyov smiled over a map of the city. Things were progressing smoothly."
 NIK.81.a:0 "We must only hope it was the right choice."
 
 NIK.82.t:0 "Zhdanov's Ceasefire"
 NIK.82.d:0 "One day the government's troops were attacking communist districts. The next, the democratic coalition's men were redeploying across the city. New positions were drafted to stop the progression of the far right's men.\n\nNo official announcement was made on the topic. It was left to the public to deduce the loose alliance that now united the communist and democrats. After all, the new combat lines of the reds and democrats would have made no sense otherwise. Vast sections of the democratic and communist districts were left lightly guarded by their owners if their frontiers happened to touch the other side's areas. This level of cooperation, as well as the heightened level of militarization of the front line with the far right demonstrated that at least some coordination had been agreed upon.\n\nGreatest loser in all this were the far right paramilitaries, suddenly pushed back from their over-extended positions. The government's temporary united front with the communist appeared to be working as intended."
 NIK.82.a:0 "Allies across the lines."
 
 NIK.83.t:0 "A Traitor?"
 NIK.83.d:0 "The two politicians were united by their distrust of the ceasefire with the reds. Stalina loathed the extremist factions for endangering Komi, while the more moderate Kosygin was worried less by the ceasefire than its implication. How the hell had the president managed to reach a deal with the reds? To the liberal leader's eyes, this secret deal meant the president must have held secret ties to the far left.\n\nThe 'rightist' members of the democratic coalition began planning a joint action against Voznesensky. The president was proving himself to be a liability to the democratic cause, and some sense needed to be talked into him... Or imposed at gunpoint, if necessary."
 NIK.83.a:0 "Peace must come first."
 NIK.83.b:0 "We are done with talk."
 
 NIK.84.t:0 "The Militarists' Confrontation"
 NIK.84.d:0 "Voznesensky looked at them benevolently, his eyes rising above a pile of paperwork. "I was told Rodionov would be present, yes?"\n\nKosygin shrugged. "He has a cold today. Voznesensky, we came here today about the ceasefire with the left. This shit can't go on. "The president cocked an eyebrow. "The left is rising in power every day. I can't take an evening walk without bumping into Suslov informants. We've had their paramilitary on the ropes with the campaign against them, and now you let them escape? If we don't destroy them now they'll relieve us of our jobs."\n\nThe president closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, his reply was confident..."
 NIK.84.a:0 "There will be no compromise!"
 NIK.84.b:0 "You see, this was the plan all along..."
 
 NIK.85.t:0 "No Compromise!"
 NIK.85.d:0 "I understand your concerns. But I'm not budging on this. During our campaign on the communist we began hemorrhaging territory to the far right. We need to crush the fascists if this republic is to last the year. If you have other concerns, feel free to bring them up to me now. Otherwise, this lovely pile of paper requires presidential signatures. "\n\nKosygin and Stalina were taken aback. Voznesensky waited expectantly for another round of argument. However, his colleagues stiffly offered him goodbye and left. The president sighed and returned to the task at hand."
 NIK.85.a:0 "What is he hiding?"
 
 NIK.86.t:0 "Voznesensky Folds"
 NIK.86.d:0 "I understand your concerns. But this has just been a temporary plan. Our men are waiting for the communist to surge out against the fascist before we turn on them. From the start I didn't trust the communist to uphold any bargain made. Thus, this method of finishing them off while also repulsing the far right's attack. "\n\n"I see."Kosygin said. Stalina's expression remained difficult to interpret. Was she buying his excuses? "We'll let you to it, Voznesensky. Sorry for bothering you. I might drop by later when the time comes to send the orders to turn on the reds, yes?"\n\n"It would be my pleasure. We'll send the encrypted orders over the radio to our commanders."Said the president, his eyes already back to his tax forms. Kosygin and Stalina left without any further word."
 NIK.86.a:0 "We can all get along, no?"
 
 NIK.87.t:0 "The Leak"
 NIK.87.d:0 "Commander names, streets, positions, hours. The radio broadcast over public frequencies didn't arouse much more than curiosity from the average civilian. But to anyone invested in Komi's great game, the communication was crystal clear. The message was a set of deployment order to governmental militias, arraying them to the rear of almost every communist militia. The only reason for such a deployment was not hard to divine.\n\nThe message was confirmed to be the real deal when policemen aligned with the democratic coalition jammed every radio frequency they could find. The government's panic demonstrated their guilt. The plan had been the annihilation of every communist brigade that could be trapped on the front line against the far right. Now everybody knew of the democrats' duplicity."
 NIK.87.a:0 "How could this be?!"
 
 NIK.88.t:0 "The Infiltrators"
 NIK.88.d:0 "The scale of the leak was titanic. To betray the deployment order of every democratic paramilitary, one would need men inside every brigade. This was the only way to break every secret cipher in a single twenty-four hour period.\n\nNot only had Suslov infiltrated the highest level of the democratic parties, the democratic paramilitaries were deeply compromised as well. The government had no secret left to fight back against the far left's puppet master."
 NIK.88.a:0 "A nest of traitors and spies!"
 
 NIK.89.t:0 "All Quiet from Zhdanov"
 NIK.89.d:0 "Voznesensky removed the brick from the wall and rummaged inside the hole. Nothing but his original message attempt.\n\nSince the disastrous radio leak, it had been impossible to reach Zhdanov. None of the usual dead drop locations had seen any activity. Voznesensky was tempted to use the emergency channel they had reserved for immediate communication. But Zhdanov's continued silence communicated a message in itself. The president burning his last contact method to hear his old friend's silent fury would not be productive.\n\nVoznesensky picked up the brick. Instead of closing up the dead drop, the politician threw the brick as far as he could. The projectile hit a distant lamppost with a loud "thunk". "When has everything gone so goddamn wrong?"Voznesensky thought bitterly."
 NIK.89.a:0 "The final betrayal."
 
 NIK.90.t:0 "Rumors of a Rising Star"
 NIK.90.d:0 "Komi's great game of politics has always ran on a steady diet of rumors. Knowing what one's opponents are doing is crucial if one desires to remain in the game. Of course, filtering out signal from noise is a skill all by itself. Tall tales, baseless speculation and hearsay are common fodder for the various intelligence agencies, and it takes time to sift through everything.\n\nThe latest craze is a rumor that an influential politician from Gorky has travelled the wastes to reach Komi. Depicted as a natural political genius and charismatic orator by the rumor mill, few agree as to what this arrival means. The most popular conclusion is that Suslov, the far left's mastermind, is likely behind it."
 NIK.90.a:0 "Another communist power-player?"
 
 NIK.91.t:0 "The Rise of Ponomaryov"
 NIK.91.d:0 "As it turned out, the man from Gorky was not from Gorky after all! Boris Ponomaryov, as the man's name turned out to be, was born in Shakhovskoye. The small village in what was once Ulyanovsk Oblast, nowadays the KONR controlled Samara government, has another famous child in the form of Mikhail Suslov. An interesting coincidence, perhaps? Few in Komi's shaky democracy would believe this.\n\nWhatever his origins are, the charismatic Ponomaryov has been making the rounds. His speech lambasting the democratic coalition's unwillingness to deal with the far right have been popular through large swathes of the population. This newcomer rides on a wave of discontent, and is likely to be one of the prime communist candidates in the next elections."
 NIK.91.a:0 "Now, what do you hide...?"
 
 NIK.92.t:0 "The Veil"
 NIK.92.d:0 "A charismatic new communist candidate from Suslov's old stomping ground is too much of a coincidence for the democratic coalition's higher ups to swallow. Suslov's command of Komi's far left is ambiguous and hard to measure. Perhaps the slippery shadow might have made a pact with a charismatic front-man to enhance his control of the party?\n\nThe young republic's policemen would of course never stoop so low as to run private investigations on the enemies of the current government. But monitoring the coming and going of new political figures definitely falls somewhere in their priority list. Better, then, to run some background checks on this new figure."
 NIK.92.a:0 "We must pierce it!"
 NIK.92.b:0 "There is no point."
 
 NIK.93.t:0 "A Revelation"
 NIK.93.d:0 "The detectives were dismayed to find that in the end Ponomaryov was... terribly dull.\n\nA paper pusher in Suslov's foreign ministry during the West Russian War, Ponomaryov fell of the face of the earth during the ensuing collapse and anarchy. Not too surprising, as the front's disintegration had seen tons of people claim authority in those first few years of the anarchy.\n\nThe man reappeared a few year laters when the situation had stabilized. Through fragmented communication Ponomaryov had managed to reach out to his old boss Suslov. As the man still resided in the WRRF's territory, it seems that Komi's communist had told him to stay there as a liaison agent with the WRRF's officer clique. A few years passed before Suslov recalled him back home. Upon arrival in Komi's capital, Ponomaryov had begun his political efforts.\n\nOutside of his speeches, Ponomaryov was a terminally boring man. Nothing more than another Suslovite automaton it seemed.\n\nThe police continued their investigation. Perhaps a few more scraps of dirt could be gathered on him. For matters of state security, of course."
 NIK.93.a:0 "Just another puppet..."
 
 NIK.94.t:0 "The Trail Fades"
 NIK.94.d:0 "Ponomaryov's private life was filled with scandals, as it turned out. When drinking with his friends, he often skipped paying for his round of drinks. Last year, a terrible cold had left him stuck at home for a week, and rumor had it that a local young woman with pretty clothes had brought him soup for the week.\n\nWell, not terribly important scandals. The police investigators were running out of leads on him. And in Syktyvkar, being too nosy could always carry an unexpected price. The far left's counter-intelligence agencies had likely expected the police to come sniffing around their man. Pushing too hard would not be a good look for the supposedly impartial governmental officers.\n\nThe police thus ended its inquiry. Boris Ponomaryov was just another communist politician hopeful. The government had other business to tend to. Hopefully the newcomer was not dangerous."

 NIK.95.t:0 "Increased Fascist Activity"
 NIK.95.d:0 "Komi's far right had always been a force to be reckoned with. Not as big as the government's democratic militias, nor as big as Suslov's web of far-left nogoodniks, the fascist militias had still maintained a respectable fighting strength. Drilling their men frequently and accumulating as many weapons as possible, the far right had earned their place as the third pillar of Komi's defense forces.\n\nFrom there, the fascist paramilitaries had adapted themselves well to the stalemate. They acquired a few quarters of the capital for their own purposes, and often clashed with democrats or communists. Their big break had been given to them by the government's recent battles with Suslov's forces. Under garrisoned communist or democratic districts had been taken over by the far right. Weapon convoys rolled between various fascist sectors as every area the far right got its hands on was reinforced by fresh militiamen.\n\nIn parallel to the military offensive had come a propaganda offensive. The democrat's pathetic attempt at crushing the decadent far left would come back to haunt Komi, the radio announcer claimed. Had the communist not squandered two opportunities to defeat the Germans already? The democratic coalition was impotent to stop the spread of the communist blight. Only hard men could manage these difficult times. The take over of new areas by fascist militias was only preventive, meant to save citizens from the communist menace. So went the far right's propaganda campaign."

 NIK.96.t:0 "Left-Voznesentsi Threaten to Split!"
 NIK.96.d:0 "This is an outrage! Even as a rising tide of fascism threatens to drown the republic, the government insists on fighting the communist? Has President Voznesensky gone mad? Or is he merely capitulating to the fear mongers of the liberal and conservative party?"\n\nThe speech was booed by the majority of the democratic party. But a worrying percentage of the Social Democratic representatives cheered the speech. The majority of the Social Democrats' left wing had been grumbling for weeks now that the fascists were left free to rampage. Now the grumbling had ended and an openly mutinous feeling had swept through the left of the Voznesensti. Rumors of a motion to end the campaign on the far left had spread through the assembly. Worryingly, rumors of mass defections to the communists had also begun spreading. The social democrats were the biggest party of the ruling coalition. Yet the loss of the party's left wing would not be good for Voznesensky's party. A loss of the majority that allowed the coalition to rule the nation would likely follow, and with that the specter of a paralyzed government unable to deal with any crisis."
 NIK.96.a:0 "An absurd demand!"
 
 NIK.97.t:0 "A Hanging Thread?"
 NIK.97.d:0 "Voznesensky's party whips had been working overtime to put the fear of God into the mutineers. As it turned out, all this effort risked being for naught.\n\nAlarms were first raised when the social democrats' left wingers refused any attempt at compromise. Several representatives that had once been open to compromise with the center and center right had now turned into hardliners. No amount of threats, negotiations or bribes could coerce them back into line. The increasingly suspicious party whips turned to less official channels. The party members' phone lines were tapped, just as paramilitary agents tracked the mutineers every moves. Eventually a pattern began to emerge: almost half of the mutineers were receiving instructions directly from Suslov and his communists!\n\nThis development has turned the mutiny crisis into a looming catastrophe. The communists had planted a hard kernel of dissenters within the social democrats for just such an eventuality. As the social democrat's left wing is riddled with Suslovite agents and those gullible enough to follow them, it is impossible to negotiate with them. The government's loss of its majority has now become imminent."
 NIK.97.a:0 "Everyone is compromised!"
 
 NIK.98.t:0 "The Olive Branch"
 NIK.98.d:0 "Zhdanov felt a little apprehensive, writing his letter. There was always a thrill, a slight pang of fear upon jumping into the unknown. His partnership with Voznesensky had been friendly all these years. It had been comfortable to slowly build up the republic as well as develop its communist party. But now the movements of Gumilyov, Suslov and the democratic war hawks required Zhdanov to step up his own game. Thus, his declaration of war as a request for peace.\n\nPresident Voznesensky would receive a humble proposal of peace. Would it not be better if the enemies of reaction united their forces to smash the fascist paramilitaries? The end of the government's assault on the communist paramilitaries would prevent the fascist from gaining strength. It would also safeguard the left's own manpower, for Zhdanov enjoyed knowing the communists held significant firepower. One day, perhaps Suslov's grip would be wrenched away from the paramilitaries, and their ownership would transfer to Zhdanov? This development would have to wait, however. Before that would come the division of the democratic party, as the liberals and conservatives would lash out against the social democrats for letting the communists go free. Voznesensky would be a victim of his attempt to broker peace with the left.\n\nIn this regard, the president might choose to reject peace. It would be a clever move, and the president was a clever man. Voznesensky would never suspect that his old mentor and long time associate would dare burn up their partnership and reveal the president's ties to the left. Such a revelation would of course immensely hurt the president. But Zhdanov suspected he wouldn't even have to go this far. After all, that wily snake Suslov had many trump cards of his own. Better let Suslov engineer a collapse of the government. This way, Zhdanov would keep his very best cards for a few more turns. The winner of the game, after all, might very well be the last man to make a move."

 NIK.99.t:0 "The Big Switch"
 NIK.99.d:0 "Boris was not big on introspection. After all, the effete intellectuals and bookish pansies didn't last long in the battlefields of Komi. The man imagined he had some level of functional cleverness if nothing else, for leading men on the battlefield required the ability to outthink the opponent as well as outfight him. Sure, Boris would never be a published author, but as the commander of one of the largest democratic paramilitaries he spent his days trying to stay one step ahead of the opposition in tactics and strategies.\n\nAfter days spent hammering communist positions and wracking his brain on how best to outflank various pockets of resistance, the commander couldn't understand where his new orders were coming from. The new word from central command was, all available forces were to stop their advances on the reds and whip around to smash the fascist paramilitaries.\n\nBoris began by verifying all of the messenger's credentials. Everything checked out, bizarrely. The orders themselves were written with the usual codes. A phone call to central headquarters confirmed this big switch in priorities. "We were on the brink of ending the communists. " the commander informed the messenger. Not as a reproach, but rather as a statement of facts. The messenger, a young man with a scraggly beard, nodded. Boris could see that his interlocutor, too, was confused by the switch of priorities. But orders were orders. 'twas not for Boris and his ilk to question them. The commander hoped his men would understand, lest things become mutinous."

 NIK.100.t:0 "Silence"
 NIK.100.d:0 "No news from the president. Zhdanov was not surprised. Perhaps a little disappointed to see his old partner choose to do this the hard way. But the communist politician knew that the easy days were over.\n\nThe first order of business was to sever some more... problematic ties with the President. Zhdanov had long exchanged information and other goodies with his partner as continuous proofs of good will. Now this trade would have to be cut back, to keep the pressure on. The usual methods of communication would also be adjusted, aside from a few emergency channels. Voznesensky would soon see that the old days of continuous access to one another were a thing of the past.\n\nThese few acts of housekeeping done, all Zhdanov could do was wait. He was fairly certain Suslov would come up with a solution to the current fruitless battle between the communists. Voznesensky was a fool if he thought the status quo could continue endlessly, in Komi's endless games of political espionage. The president might one day be shocked to learn that his democratic coalition is not as secure as he'd like."

 NIK.101.d:0 "Komi's legislative assembly began its meeting today barely above quorum. A vast numbers of deputies of the leading democratic coalition failed to show up. Worryingly, almost all were members of the left wing of Voznesensky's social democrats. Party whips were also conspicuously absent the entire morning. In the back corridors of the legislative assembly, the democratic faction's insiders exchanged urgent whispers about the situation.\n\nIn the afternoon the missing deputies came in after the lunch break. Without a word, the men and women of the assembly picked up their chairs and offices and dragged them to the communist side of the assembly. The rain of jeers and boos from their former democratic colleagues did nothing to hinder their progress. The far right and far left observed the situation carefully. A few communists exchanged written memos, but none spoke publicly. Once the commotion was dealt with and order was restored to the assembly, the democratic coalition's majority no longer existed. While neither the communists nor the fascists made a big case of it, the government now lived on borrowed time. At any moment a vote of no confidence could go through to bring down the previously impervious democratic coalition."

 NIK.102.t:0 "Some Light Blackmail?"
 NIK.102.d:0 "Zhdanov watched the kettle heat up. The office's samovar had run out of water for the tea. Hence, the politician had left his office to fetch some more. The gas flames licked the kettle, rendering it red hot in the badly lit communal kitchen. Inside the steel kettle, pressure was rising to a fevered pitch.\n\nThe abandon of the Social Democratic party by its left wing had brought Komi's fragile status quo to the brink. Now pressure was welling up within the legislative assembly as the democratic coalition desperately searched for a pathway to a new majority. Zhdanov had not heard of Voznesensky since the sudden betrayal. It was not difficult to imagine where the president's mind was at the moment. Rage at being undercut by the communists. Anguish at the thought of his ties with Zhdanov coming to light. Now might be the best moment for Zhdanov to push against the President, to weaken him further before the left could bring a final breakdown of the coalition. By threatening a full reveal of their connection, Zhdanov could try to extract some concession or another, such as a tax free communist district. This would further weaken the President and estrange him from his allies. But the communist politician knew that Voznesensky was a proud man, and was equally likely to resist any further attempt at blackmail. That might prove another worthwhile scenario, for if the president refused further cooperation with Zhdanov he might not live the week politically. Zhdanov surmised that the social democrat's allies would not remain allies for long of a president that had brought their government to the abyss.\n\nThe kettle's whistle brought Zhdanov out of his reverie. Yes, his former protege was stuck in a pressure chamber of his own making. The least that Zhdanov could do was to bring him out of it at the first opportunity... Or at least, do so when it would be most profitable to Zhdanov's own ascension to the top."

Any interested party would be able to follow the friendship and business partnership of one Nikolai Voznesensky with one Andrei Zhdanov, of Komi's communist party.\n\nThis unusual set of literature was soon shared by both the media and Komi's political caste as the truth about President Voznesensky's communist dealings came out to the public. Most enraged of all were his allies in the democratic coalition: the remaining social democrats, suddenly realizing the cause of their party's downfall; Shafarevich's conservatives, our erstwhile allies, unnerved by the idea of communists worming their way into the government; and most of all Kosygin's liberals, livid at the betrayal. The chief of the liberal party has gone on the warpath upon hearing of the leaks, promising a vote of no-confidence to oust the traitor president. Any protest that doing so would hand a significant amount of power to the communist have been brushed aside by Kosygin and his allies. "The republic cannot trust executive power to a communist stooge", after all."

In disgrace, Voznesensky saw his presidency revoked and was forced to cede power to Kosygin, his former second in command. Komi's constitution is quite clear about the chain of succession for executive power. The downfall of Voznesensky means the ascension of Kosygin.\n\nIf book makers weren't sure about betting on the downfall of the former President, money is already being put on the lifespan of the new presidency. For all his energetic speech urging the removal of Voznesensky, Kosygin has not given any response to those who worry about the fragility of the democratic coalition. Shorn of the social democrat's left wing, and with his contempt of the communists on display, the new president must quickly find a way of stabilizing his political backing, lest the same fate befalls him.\n\nhis political reputation as a neutral leader of order and stability destroyed, and his political party collapsing, Voznesensky's political career is finished.

A last minute surge of support by the far right brought in support for President Voznesensky. This support has added to the surprising amount of support the far left has given the President. Yes, Voznesensky has proven to be an enemy of the common worker... But Kosygin has done nothing but encourage the democratic coalition to ramp up the war against the left. The communist leaders thus left individual members of parliament free to vote. As such a surprising grouping of deputies have let Voznesensky cling to power.\n\nThe leader of the liberal party has answered with a speech about the ignominy of staying in power through fascist and communist votes. Kosygin has urged vigilance to all members of the democratic coalition, lest radical agenda slip through Voznesensky's presidential orders. In a speech of his own, a visibly shaken Voznesensky has thanked the republic for its continued confidence in him. The President went on to urge cooperation in these difficult time. The president's speech was bereft of its usual crisp and decisive flavor, much as Voznesensky's government itself has been hollowed out of any real base of support."

"Your cooperation on the tax exemption deal is much appreciated. I will uphold my end of the bargain."\n\nVoznesensky tossed the crumpled memo into the fireplace. His old mentor had now turned into a merciless jailor. What choice did the president have but collaboration with Zhdanov? Without the social democrat's majority in the chamber, Voznesensky had entered a very precarious position. Any hint to the rest of the democratic coalition that he was compromised by communist deals would see them throw him out into the streets.\n\nThe president pushed the food away.

Many politicized youths join the army to learn the art of violence, only to seek further employment in the militias after their tour of service. Others join the army in between stints in the streets of the capital, often to let the heat die down after a recent militia clash.\n\nToday a group of communist leaning soldiers have announced an unlimited strike to protest the government's violence against the far left. "Why has the government gone back on its words and broken the truce with the communist parties? Why are noble men of the republican army sent to die for political bickerings?" asked the speakers to assembled soldiers. A chorus of indignation lifted up the question, as policemen observed the public protest.\n\nNumbers are still coming in, but it seems that our initial guess that one third of the army has communist leanings has proven accurate. Down to sixty-six percent of its usual strength, and with all of its tank corps joining the strike, our army has been badly hit by this strike."

Attempts by communist paramilitaries to support the strikers were fought off violently. After a day of bloody battles, the strikers were dishonorably discharged and sent home without pay.\n\nIt remains to be seen if this has hurt the communist in any real way, as the soldiers have simply flooded into their old paramilitary units. The tanks themselves have rolled away from the army bases and into their storage depots near the communist headquarters. No attempt was made to prevent this, the government fearing rampaging tankers turning their guns on Syktyvkar's buildings.

These protests have been drowned out in turn by a tidal wave of outrage from parties ranging from social democrats to the far right. "The communists thugs have deserted their posts in this hour of need" pointed out a fascist deputy, to a mixture of applause and jeers.\n\nThe fascist paramilitaries are known to maintain their own strict standards of training and obedience.

The government's protest that this has proven out to be an unworkable deal in the long run has fallen on deaf ears. These new soldiers insist they are loyal to the government, and consider their demands for more autonomy as a proof of trust of the government in them.\n\nGovernmental intelligence sources have tried to decipher the far right's communication. Many higher-ups of the democratic coalition suspect Lev Gumilyov, shadow master of the far right to be behind this recent agitation. While his endgame is difficult to deduce, it is clear that Gumilyov is using the government's position of weakness to extract political gains."

And through all this, the regiment's officers were slowly being shuffled around. An apolitical colonel decided on an early retirement. His replacement was a well known ultra-nationalist. Little by little, the grievances of the former paramilitaries simply went away, solved on their own by the military command's bureaucracy.\n\nDemocratic politicians are now pouring resources into the issue. Has the far right penetrated the military's high command? Or as it simply been a case of Gumilyov spreading bribes to get things to go his way? Either situation are deeply unsettling to the democratic parties. Perhaps the government has traded Suslov's Charibdis for Gumilyov's Scylla."

Now that his supporters hold a non trivial position in the republican army, Shafarevich's political star, as tainted as it is by his associated to Gumilyov, has risen sharply.\n\nHis temporary partners in the democratic coalition have not reacted much to this new reality, as the military is, supposedly, a politically neutral organization. However, in Komi a ministerial reshuffle is never far away, and a new conservative ministry might go a long way toward reaching out to the government's new partner.\n\nCommunist politicians, on the other hand, have not been happy to see the rightists gain new supporters. Rumors on the left is that the so-called 'traditional democratic' militias are secretly filled with fascist and Gumilyovites.

Of course, Suslov's job was not merely to do administrative work, but to support those in the party whomst he saw fit so that the party as a whole could grow.\n\nTo his expectations, Bukharina had made quite a splash in the party. Being the daughter of the old General Secretary tended to do that, after all. Suslov had also expected Bukharina to push her more reformist ideas. However, what he did not expect was just how popular Bukharina's ideas would be. Not only did it appeal to those in the Communist Party, but to a surprising amount of those outside the party as well. She leveraged her influence very well, it seemed. Such an opportunity could not be wasted, as the party always needed more influence in its struggle against the right and the center. More resources would have to be moved to the "legitimate" side of politics, which meant more could be invested towards supporting Bukharina.\n\nSuslov leaned back in his chair, sipping his tea.

However, Mikhail Suslov simply couldn't justify choosing to back her as the Party's future candidate. She was becoming too popular, too influential, and she was becoming a threat to Suslov's position as leader of the Communist Party. She was quickly becoming the leader of the reformists within the Communist Party, revisionists whose influence Suslov had attempted to limit in the past. Bukharina was ambitious, and Suslov had determined long ago that such people were not reliable.\n\nInstead, Suslov needed someone who could be a public face, and who could follow orders. The solution: Boris Ponomaryov, who already served as a counterbalance to Zhdanov. He was a competent administrator, an affable puppet, and a born follower. He was perfect for the role Suslov needed to fill. It was time to make it official, Boris Ponomaryov would be formally backed as the Communist Party's candidate for the foreseeable future."

I am pleased to work besides such noble comrades as yourselves, and under the gentle guiding of Comrade Suslov.\n\nIt is thus that I inform you two of the other purpose of this letter - I see in my heart of hearts a most prosperous future for the three of us, and I believe that, in a surely far-flung future where Comrade Suslov does not occupy his current position, we could find a most reasonable accord.\n\n- Svetlana Bukharina."

Mikhail Suslov was more familiar than most with this philosophy - he supposed he was like a spider of sorts. He built the web, he maintained the web, and if any outsiders were trapped within the web, he would see them destroyed.\n\nOf late, his carefully maintained and orderly cobweb had tremored on the winds of fate, and he had a growing worry that he was not the only spider that claimed it as their own. Ponomaryov, ever the loyal sycophant, had reported to him as he had on all other nights one stormy evening; but when Suslov asked him about Svetlana Bukharina, the hesitation before he spoke, dismissing her as a threat and suggesting Suslov should turn his eyes elsewhere? More than that, Ponomaryov disagreed with his assessment of a threat?\n\nThat was alarming.\n\nIt was clear the man was compromised, likely accepting some bribe or promise of power by Bukharina. The thought made Suslov's blood curl - this wasn't Bukharin's runt's party - it was Suslov's.\n\nSuslov prepared for the inevitable. The power play would come soon, he predicted - and he was rarely wrong about these things. When Bukharina attempted to goad him into a trap, she wouldn't even see his coming."

As much as he hated to admit it, it indulged a certain feeling of power to play with the two-dimensional surrogates of his colleagues and subordinates as he wove his plans together.\nWith all of his contacts, personal relationships, and...other leverage, he could fairly easily determine who would be the next party leader. He skimmed through the assemblage, intermittently striking some figures off the list outright as being too ambitious. Others were, in Suslov's estimation, too powerful in their own right. And then, of course, there were those who had certain ...deviant ideas regarding the party's direction.\nNaturally, it was a man who met none of those criteria that caught Suslov's eye. A seemingly capable but relatively unknown party apparatchik who had nonetheless distinguished himself as having an ironclad work ethic.

He'd always been a believer that when paramilitaries were brawling in the streets and politicians doing the same in the National Assembly, the best course of action is to keep one's head down and pretend not to notice any of it. However, despite his best efforts, it was rather hard to ignore the constant barrage of posters, leaflets, and the other paraphernalia of electoral democracy. Despite his best efforts, he'd come to be familiar with most of the cast of characters commonly depicted on such posters. And when the chill winds of early autumn began to sweep down onto Syktyvkar from the Arctic Circle, it all became impossible to ignore, as every last scrap of paper in the street was set loose into the air in a blizzard of political propaganda. Thus, he couldn't help but notice one day, when all of the red paper swirling through the streets was adorned with the face of a man he'd never seen before."

For the sixth straight year, it had been the site not only of the political conventions of the right-wingers and Voznesentsy, but also the Communists, whose turn it was today to use the space. Because of this, the place was almost universally assumed to be bugged. Of course, no one wanted to actually admit this, since any party's leveling of this allegation would be immediately met by a litany of their own misdeeds, so it was generally in everyone's interest to handle all public matters in the ballroom and do all the actual negotiating in the vacant lot behind the hotel.\n\nThe sharp clap of a worn gavel brought the room to order as Mikhail Suslov walked onstage, taking his place at a podium in the center of a long table of allegedly important party figures. Of course, Suslov had put almost every single one of them there, and had a means to keep them in line. Which is precisely what made his current task so irritating.\n\n"Comrades, I am pleased to announce that the Komi Communist Party's candidate for the upcoming elections is Andrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov." Loud applause and a few cheers rippled across the crowd as the stocky, mustached man walked up the aisle, sporting his best equivalent of a smile - really more of a cheerful grimace. Suslov exchanged a quick handshake with Zhdanov onstage, and, feigning enthusiasm, went on for a few minutes about how bright the party's future was under their new candidate. Inside, of course, Suslov's feelings were quite different. He had built this organization up from nothing, and everyone who had a position here had it because he allowed it. And as he stepped back and watched Zhdanov work the crowd, Suslov knew this had to be nipped in the bud before it grew out of control. The fact that both men privately agreed on a number of doctrinal issues made no difference. Either Zhdanov would learn to bend the knee, or he would have to be driven out. There was simply no alternative. And Suslov wouldn't have it any other way."

"I'm not going to speak in terms of personal loyalty or ideology – I know you, and you know me. We both want power, pure and simple. I wouldn't be surprised if Zhdanov has already made some sort of proposal to you, and if he hasn't, he will soon."\n\n"And?"\n\n"I'd simply like to reiterate what should be a self-evident truth: Zhdanov will dispose of you and your kith and kin the instant I am gone.

Why do you think you've gotten this far in a party with this much anti-Bukharinite sentiment? Goodwill alone? Your family name? I need people at my side."\n\nInternally, Bukharina had to acknowledge he was right, at least in part. She had been the recipient of Suslov's patronage time and time again.\n\n"So what you're saying is that I have a choice between being a puppet under you and dead under Zhdanov."\n\n"Cruder terminology than I would have used, but directionally correct, Comrade Bukharina.

The upcoming elections have our headquarters in...disarray," Voznesensky explained. "Only physically, of course," he quickly added. Zhdanov's host motioned to an adjacent, empty, conference room. Voznesensky waited until his guest was seated to direct the conversation to the nebulous "business" Zhdanov was so keen to discuss in private.\n\n"To put it simply, Nikolai," Zhdanov said, "I'm asking for your backing in the settling of a political score." These words alone didn't take Voznesensky by surprise, it was the name that came next that did. Mikhail goddamned Suslov.\n\n"With all due respect, Andrei...I don't see how this concerns our party. All concerns of practicality or wisdom aside, this is an internal matter for your party. Suslov's goons are a non-entity for us."\n\n"You're very quick to deny the existence of half of your own party's membership," Zhdanov shot back in a retort he'd been practicing in his head for longer than he really wanted to admit.

The fact remained that, if she was to ever take the helm of the Komi state, Suslov would have to be gone. A man like him could not be brought to heel or compromised with. He had to be broken, and on that level, Zhdanov's words had some value.\n\nThe phone rang a third time.\n\nOf course, Bukharina could not forget the fact that anything coming out of Zhdanov's mouth was almost certain to bare venomous fangs at her sooner or later. Even compared to the two-faced bureaucrats of Komi, Zhdanov had always displayed a truly disturbing level of comfort with falsehood and deceit. In the bizarre political mirror-universe that was the Komi Republic, an offer of an alliance from Zhdanov was perhaps best considered a florid threat.\n\nSvetlana Bukharina, however, was well acquainted with danger.

 NIK.143.d:0 "Sergei approached Kosygin, who was hastily leaving the government building, as if he had somewhere he had to urgently go. As always, he was in formal clothing even in a normal day in office. Initially, Sergei went unnoticed, but Kosygin eventually realized he was running behind him.\n\nThe bureaucrat was looking worried when he began speaking to the leader of the liberal movement. "Sir, have you thought this Komi program through? Specifically, I am quite worried about including Voznesensky in this. You must have heard of what he's said in the past! He is not known for his kindness and respect to minorities. Hell, he has even called them traitors!" Kosygin seemed to be not particularly worried about this, almost as if he didn't care. "If you let him organize this, our public image could take a hit: imagine when our political opponents hear that the enemy of the native Komi has decided to respect their culture. It would be a scandal!"\n\nKosygin barely raised an eyebrow, and calmly replied: "Don't worry, everything is under control. You are overreacting, that's all." Before Sergei could reply, Kosygin had already left the building."

 NIK.144.d:0 "Kosygin sat quietly in his office, looking at the view from the window and going over documents regarding the upcoming events in the capital. Nothing was scheduled for the next few hours, so it was just him and the work he had to do. But as much as he tried to focus on it, one topic kept coming up in his mind: Voznesensky and his ... racist tendencies. On the one hand, cooperating with the social democrats would be useful in general: he could appease the President, continuing to usurp power from his faction while keeping good terms. On the other hand, his knowledge of the President's beliefs was worrying. The public relations of the Center Coalition, and his own party by extension, could hang in the balance if a scandal appeared. Would he risk such a thing for power?"

And today, we have ... quite the interesting story, from our own President Voznesensky! My friend Igor is here to explain what has happened."\n\n"Thank you. Last night, we received tape recordings from a source that would like to remain anonymous, and contain excerpts of private dialogues made between the President and some of his party associates, even including prominent faces of the Center Coalition we are all familiar with. Why don't we hear them?"\n\nVoznesensky's voice was heard, slightly corrupted: "... the Komi, the damn Komi! Do you have any idea how much this messes up our plans? We can't [corrupted], and that is all because of the damn natives. They're communists, I tell you, traitors to the country, all of them! One day we'll deal with the problem they are for our Republic!"\n\n"And that's what I call a damn interesting recording! In light of the recent developments, it makes Voznesensky all the more hypocritical: publicly supporting a program to help the natives, yet insulting them indiscriminately behind closed doors? Let us hear your thoughts, listeners!""

 NIK.146.t:0 "The Paradox"
 NIK.146.d:0 "Reports from our government officials and associates talk regarding the program to gain the support of the native voting base, while mostly positive, show it has not been a clear success. As for the program itself, it was pulled off almost perfectly, going without a hitch. Many Komi welcomed the opportunity to receive help by the government and seem supportive of the new policy.\n\nIn general, some seem convinced by this, but despite this small boost in the popularity of the Social Democrats and the Coalition, it would be a lie to say we are fully satisfied with the results. The numbers we were hoping for were not achieved, and small hurdles in our way reduced the effectiveness, with many natives either not convinced due to the President's past, or simply indifferent to the new policy. It seems that this was not the help we are looking for to gain support in our struggle against the left and right."

Organized by the groups aimed at the preservation of Komi culture and tradition, some endorsed by the government, it has been a massive success.\n\nThe festival is located in one of the capital's major parks, in one of the safest neighborhoods, which has helped it avoid any paramilitary clashes. Many Komi took the opportunity to help in the festival, by participating in the exhibitions of anything from traditional clothes, to customs and music. The neighborhood has been flooded with the colorful patterns of the natives, and some artists have even helped create a fusion of these traditional designs with modern ideas for artistic masterpieces. The Museum of Komi Culture also cooperated, and has welcomed many visitors this week.\n\nIn general, the Festival seems to have been a massive success for the organizers. Many Russian citizens of Syktyvkar were actually ignorant of the Komi lifestyle and culture, and found this as a fascinating opportunity to educate themselves on it. Now, all of the city is more informed on what this civilization truly is."

 NIK.148.d:0 "One of the most well-known authors in the Komi Republic, Viktor Smirnov, who is in fact an ethnic Komi, has recently released one of his most popular books, "A History of our Republic". The book details the history of modern Komi, from the creation of the autonomous territories by the Soviet Union, to its role as part of the WRRF, until its modern state. The author has in fact lived through almost this entire era, and as such had a first-hand experience that helped him write the book.\n\nCritics have acclaimed the book, which combines elements of historical literature with Smirnov's own experiences throughout his life in a way appealing to all readers. The History of the Republic has skyrocketed in popularity days within its release among both ethnic Rusians and natives. The Komi themselves also appear to be satisfied with the image presented, and point to the modern problems mentioned as well as the need for equality and respect from their co-patriots.\n\nThe question is, aside from the clear cultural impact and legacy such a popular book will leave in the Republic, if there will possibly be any political implications. Smirnov himself has clearly stated he is not affiliated with any of the myriads of political organizations operating in the nation, and is independent. Of course, not all believe that, but for the most part, "A History of Our Republic" appears to be nothing more than an insight into the history of the natives that play such an important role in this nation."

 NIK.149.t:0 "The Party's Composition"
 NIK.149.d:0 "One inevitability of Komi's politics is that the status quo will change radically, at a moment's notice. The sadness of this factor, however, is that, at the moment, the status quo seems to be shifting radically away from the ruling Voznesensti faction.\n\nLike it or not, by simple virtue of being the public face of the democratic factions in the Republic, public support has been eroded by scandal after scandal, be they real or constructed by our political enemies. Public support, ever fleeting and ephemeral, has, as of late, been shifting either to the Suslovite extreme left, or the more moderate liberal and conservative factions - those of our coalition partners.\n\nAs our coalition seems to undergo a period of self-restructuring, it is critical to ensure that political capital is more or less maintained by the ruling party, and that the current President isn't challenged too heavily by our own allies. Whether the solution to this is limiting our most credible coalition partner, or simply standing by and letting our power shrivel away, is entirely up to the whims of the President."

 NIK.150.t:0 "A Conversation with Stalina"
 NIK.150.d:0 "Vosnesensky sips at his tea. It's a little sweet for his taste, but he keeps the smile hanging as he faces the cool-faced Stalina. It's always good to keep a little contrast with conversational partners, in any case. Helps with the banter. Not that there's much to talk about these days, besides the endless politics of the Republic. Teacup arrangements as the storm of Russia rages on around them.\n\n"Do you miss the old days, then? Svetlana?" Before he's quite ready the words leave his mouth, to his mild regret.\n\nStalina's face stays closed. She looks at her tea, a twitch flicking across her otherwise controlled features.\n\n"I wouldn't say so, no. The past is a different time."\n\n"Different, but rosier than the present. I certainly won't miss the days of fighting over bills when this is all over."\n\n"Oh, Nikolai. This isn't fighting, this is just...my father used to call it war without war. And look where we've gotten this Republic, by fighting this hard. How far we've come. If this is how democracy works, I'll stick by it."\n\nStalina smiles, almost wolfish. "And I know you, you old fox - you like it here as much as I do. You'd die without the next bill to argue down or to push up."\n\nVosnesensky laughs back at her. "You truly do know me. Perhaps I have still underestimated you, hm, Stalina? Yes, perhaps there is health left in this place - even if this old fox dies, Komi will struggle to breathe.""

A gunman retches to the side of the acrid smokestack that pours from the gaping hole in the house's remains. Those with a little more composure hold the sobbing townsfolk and the screaming widow away from the scene. (If she wasn't a widow before, she is certainly a widow now.)\n\nOfficer Popov takes a whiff of his cigarette, hacking as his fingers tremble. He's waiting for someone, and that someone is late. Lateness is not a quality the Vosnesensky Brigade (Irregular) appreciates. As the distant screams recede, his acquaintance swims into view. Grabbing irritably at the dust on his lapels, Commander Koslov makes his way to the burning frontage. He kicks aside a brick, nods briskly, and the two are down to business.\n\n"There is little to discuss, Popov." The Commander glares into the distance, pointing southeast of the duo's position. "You shoot two men here, we kill a couple more. We'll do the same this time next week."\n\n"Not what I was talking about. We're hitting those fucking Bolshies in our own neighbourhoods, so what about the others?" Popov is venomous, his searing gaze directed towards all of Communism, or perhaps it is focused on Koslov. "We need to spread out. This does nothing for the health of the Republic."\n\nKoslov brushes his ragged beard. His men will gladly go where there is game to be had, but control is thin enough in this district as it is. Is it worth the expenditure? Will their paymasters in the Parliament be happy? He shrugs. It will, in the end, be him who decides, not some waistsuited corpse. Democracy is built on the ground in Komi, even when it is built bullet by bullet."

 NIK.152.d:0 "The annual assembly of the democratic coalition for 1963 took place in Syktyvkar's one good hotel. Perhaps by virtue of its lack of competition, the hotel's quality left something to be desired. But it was indoor, it wasn't in ruins, and the staff mostly kept the attending guests fed with a steady stream of passable food and piping hot tea.\n\nDelegates from all of the coalition's parties could be seen. Chief among them were Voznesensky's colleagues in the social democrat party and Kosygin's social liberals, the twin pillar of the democratic coalition. Also present in number were Yakovlev's social conservatives, its delegates mingling with the social democrats and liberals as everyone searched for a place to seat. Present less in a political quality, and more in their role as important bureaucrats and power brokers of the coalition were members of the democratic government, such as police officers, bureaucrats and paramilitary bosses. These institutions member tended to gather around Stalina and her increasingly influential PSD party. The rising star of the democratic coalition drew much attention and courtesy visits from all three other democratic parties. If this situation bothered any of the three party chief, no clear evidence could be seen in their warm reception of the woman and her closest associates."

This gift of freedom and peace, of a place where we can help one another to rebuild our fractured nation, this gift of democracy enduring and untarnished, this gift is one I ardently wish to protect. As this assembly proceeds with the election of a candidate for the presidential elections, I stress to all gathered today: debate the merits of each presidential hopeful. But once a candidate for our coalition is chosen, I implore you to follow them without hesitation. The unity of our coalition is one of our strongest weapons against the radicals that seek to bring our republic to an early end.

Rather, the former economist made a clear, concise case, his words, stripped from needless extravagance. After the customary round of thanks to the assembly, and the congratulations given to Voznesensky and Yakovlev for their efforts in the coalition, Kosygin reached the heart of his speech.\n\n"The Germans have squandered the wealth of their nation in fuel and bombs for a terror bombing campaign that has accomplished very little. Now, the frequency of bombings dwindles by the day. Rumors coming from Moskowien detail the upcoming collapse of the Reich. My friends, once the German planes are gone we shall be free to rebuild. We've kept hope all these years. Our childrens were taught as best as possible. Our homes were cleaned of debris where possible. Now that the terror bombing campaign is ending, the reconstruction of Russia can begin. New factories, new schools, new courthouses, new churches. The republic's citizens are strong and hardworking. A new republic is within reach." Kosygin paused. "It is my belief that this republic can re-unite Russia. Chosen as candidate for our esteemed coalition, and elected president of the Republic, I vow to dedicate all my energy to a new Russian nation able to house generations upon generations. Our cause is just, and it shall take us to the Pacific sea in the east... And to Moscow and St. Petersburg in the west. Thank you.""

His energetic and driven way of approaching any topic had helped him lead his nation throughout a range of issues, and his particular way of speaking had its usual effect on the assembly of making everyone in the audience captivated.\n\n"Honorable members of the assembly, thank you for your presence. Thank you a million times for your support, for it was by your help that I could become president, and it was through your continued support that our coalition government has safeguarded Komi's citizens these past few years. I call once again upon your support for my nomination as presidential candidate. The republic stands at a crossroad, as shadowy figures emerge to the forefront of Komi's politics. Several sets of long planned intrigues are reaching their conclusion , and their impact on the Republic promises to be an unmitigated disaster. I request a new mandate to continue the struggle against the snakes that wish to usurp our institutions. Stalina was right in denouncing the group of rabble rousers that spread their poison into the veins of our parliamentary system. The time to strike is almost upon us; in a new mandate I would bring down the might of the legal system upon those who scheme the nation's destruction. Our institutions can, and must, be reinforced so that no matter the amount of muck thrown by our opponents into its working, our republic will live on to bring our people to a bright future.""

Or was it something about Stalina that elevated her above the other candidates? Either way, Stalina now stood before the legislature, not as a Deputy, but as President of the Republic. Within her inaugural speech, Stalina laid out her plans for Komi:\n\n"Dear citizens of the Republic, dear friends, radicalism is a dangerous thing. In the war, I felt the bite of radicalism for the first time. It has cost me my father, my mother, my husband, and my brother. We must oppose radicalism at all costs, before it costs us that which is most precious: our democracy. We must stand together under the principles of sovereignty, democracy, and patriotism! We must construct a strong, united Republic; we must construct a strong, united Russia! Our Republic must be assertive, our brave soldiers must be strong, and our people must be fed! We shall not fall to radicalism, which weakens our democracy and divides our people! Radicalism divided our Motherland, and continues to divide our Motherland! We must ensure the safety of our democracy, so that we may ensure the safety of all of Russia! I vow to you that we shall have stability, and that we shall have unity! Our Republic shall stand strong and united! All of Russia shall stand strong and united!"\n\nStalina's speech was certainly passionate and idealistic. Stalina's critics nevertheless still call her an authoritarian, and voice many concerns over her calls to expand the military and police. Nevertheless, only time will tell if President Stalina was the right choice for Komi."

 NIK.17803.t:0 "The Inauguration of President Kosygin"
 NIK.17803.d:0 "The results are in, and it appears that Alexey Kosygin has been elected as President. Was it simply a dissatisfaction with the status quo? Or was it something about Kosygin that elevated him above the other candidates? Either way, Kosygin now stood before the legislature, not as a Deputy, but as President of the Republic. In his inaugural speech, Kosygin laid out his plans for Komi:\n\n"Deputies of the Republic, we can surely all agree that Komi has seen incredible progress in recent years. We have made great progress in recovering from the bombings, lowering the death toll, and attracting people to live in our great Republic. I do not wish to harm any of those advances. However, I believe a new course of action is the right choice for Komi's future. We must not be satisfied with the current status quo, which brings such inequality and chaos to our Republic. We must also not adhere blindly to an economic system that creates such inequality within our people and places such heavy restrictions upon the common man. If we are to develop our Republic, we must introduce: Stable democracy, sweeping market reforms, and a greater openness to the outside world. Komi must see greater liberalization in its economy in order to bring about a truly equal society. I call upon the legislature to stand for democracy and reform, so that our Republic may be the shining beacon to all of Russia's peoples."\n\nKosygin's speech fit such a prominent and experienced politician. However, Kosygin's critics asked how exactly his reforms would bring equality to the common man, and if Kosygin's speech was too optimistic and betrayed his tendency to focus too much upon urbanites and intellectualism. Nevertheless, only time will tell if President Kosygin was the right choice for Komi."

 NIK.172.t:0 "Violence at the Polls!"
 NIK.172.d:0 "We have received news of severe violence erupting in many of our polling locations. In total, three people have been killed and nineteen have been wounded by paramilitary violence. This has started to discourage many other voters, and some of our polling places are even closing down!\n\nIt is not known if it was communist or fascist paramilitaries that carried out the attacks, and it very well could be both of them. If their goal was to scare voters, it is definitely working. Although, this does not mean they are only scaring away our voters.\n\nUnfortunately, this does not bode well for our election process, and we may see much less voting than we expected. Paramilitary threats combined with the fears of German bombers, even after all the efforts we took to keep polling places safe, have influenced many in their decision not to participate."
 NIK.172.a:0 "An unacceptable violation of their rights!"

 NIK.173.t:0 "Peace?"
 NIK.173.d:0 "Good news from the polling stations, it seems the violence has died down and more people are feeling safer to vote. While not as many as we would like, it is still hopefully enough to legitimize the outcome of the vote. Results are coming in as normal and the counting is about ready to begin.\n\nWhile peace may reign supreme now, we must still tread carefully. We cannot know when the violence may pick up again. Depending on the outcome of the elections, anything could happen. We must stay prepared."
 NIK.173.a:0 "Finally some good news."

 NIK.174.t:0 "Reports of Threatening Leftist Activity"
 NIK.174.d:0 "More violence has begun to pick up as more agitators are taking to the streets. We have information that these are leftist extremists who are protesting our actions and the election. They are claiming we have illegally taken action against their movement and against the democratic process. Now, these anarchists have begun causing large amounts of damage and conflicts between the agitators and police have grown.\n\nThe leftist paramilitaries have even gone as far as preemptively declaring the election as rigged, even though not every vote has not even been counted. This has hurt the legitimacy of our elections, as it appears we are deliberately trying to secure our power. Whether this has any impact on our government remains to be seen.\n\nOur police continue to try and keep the violence at a minimum, but it appears the violence will only keep growing until the elections are over and the government secures its power."
 NIK.174.a:0 "When can this election be over already?"

 NIK.175.t:0 "Reports of Threatening Rightist Activity"
 NIK.175.d:0 "More violence has begun to grow as more paramilitaries are taking to the streets. We now have reports that rightist extremists are intensely protesting our administration and the election. They are claiming we have illegally taken action against their movement and ideology by hurting them in the elections and stopping their supporters from voting. Now, these militias have begun causing large amounts of violence, and conflicts with paramilitaries and police have begun to spiral out of control.\n\nThe rightists are also declaring the election as rigged, even though the election is not yet over. This has hurt the legitimacy of our elections, as it appears we are deliberately trying to keep the rightists out of power. Supporters of the right-winger parties are even calling for the resignation of our government.\n\nOur police are still trying to keep the violence confined to only limited areas, but it appears the paramilitaries will only continue to gain strength until the elections are over and the government secures power."
 NIK.175.a:0 "When will it end?"

 NIK.176.t:0 "Sweet Victory!"
 NIK.176.d:0 "The results of the election are in, and the democratic coalition now has a comfortable majority in the legislature. The radicals and extremists have been defeated at the polls and should hopefully no longer pose a threat to our government. This is a great day for our republic and for our democracy!\n\nWhile the radicals of the far right and far left may contend the results, these elections prove to have greatly weakened their chances at power. No extremist has any chance to be elected peacefully and democratically. But our government must tread carefully, the leftists and their rightist counterparts now only have a stronger reason to pursue power with more violent means.\n\nStill, with our majority, we are free to pursue our agenda much more easily than if we had to cooperate with any radicals. We must act quickly if we want to stabilize the republic and our rule."
 NIK.176.a:0 "Our Democracy remains secure, at least for now."

 NIK.177.t:0 "Minority Rule"
 NIK.177.d:0 "The results of the election are in, and our democratic coalition has been declared the victors. However, there are not enough seats in the legislature to form a majority. The leftists have also become a huge power after the elections, and they almost eclipse the entire government. We are stuck in minority rule, forced to cooperate with the leftist radicals.\n\nThis makes it much harder for us to actually move forward with our agenda. With a large leftist opposition, we will have to appease the far left if we want to get anything done. This will make it much more difficult to stabilize our government after the election turmoil. Some of the new legislators were even caught during the elections alongside paramilitaries and militias! There is no doubt that the far left now has considerable power."
 NIK.177.a:0 "At least it wasn't a total loss, right?"

 NIK.178.t:0 "Minority Rule"
 NIK.178.d:0 "The results of the election are in, and our democratic coalition has been declared the victors. However, there are not enough seats in the legislature to form a majority.

We have been forced into minority rule, stuck cooperating with the rightist extremists.\n\nThis makes it much more difficult for us to actually move forward with our agenda. With a large rightist opposition, we will have to appease the far-right if we want to get anything done. This makes it much more difficult to stabilize our government after the election turmoil. Some of the new legislators were even caught during the elections alongside paramilitaries and militias. The far right has gained considerable power."
 NIK.178.a:0 "At least it wasn't a total loss, right?"

 NIK.179.t:0 "The Critical Point"
 NIK.179.d:0 "It appears that we have seriously underestimated how dangerous our current situation is. Protests and riots have been expanding as our police force cannot handle the growing number of people protesting our actions. There are also reports of far left attacks on our garrisons. Paramilitaries and militias from the far-left have even gotten into several armed conflicts with our military.\n\nWith the chaos growing, we are beginning to suspect an incoming radical leftist coup. The information we have within the leftist parties report of plans to storm government offices and quite possibly the legislature. We even have detailed information on the movement of weapons, and possibly parts of the military planning treason.\n\nWe must act before everything gets out of control, but we have no ideas what to do or who to trust. Even our informants are sending mixed messages. With the large possibility of disloyal sections of the military supporting the coup, we must secure our government buildings. The leftists could strike at any moment."
 NIK.179.a:0 "We may not have much time left."

 NIK.180.t:0 "The Critical Point"
 NIK.180.d:0 "It appears that we have seriously underestimated how unpopular our administration is. Protests and riots are getting more violent as our police force cannot handle the growing number of people in the streets. There are even reports of far-right attacks on members of our coalition. Paramilitaries and militias from the far-right have even gotten into several armed conflicts with the police.\n\nWith the chaos growing, we are beginning to suspect an incoming far-right fascist coup. There are reports of rightist party leaders planning a march on the legislature building and other government offices. There are also reports of soldiers disobeying orders and even joining the paramilitaries.\n\nWe must act before the situation goes out of control. There is a large possibility of the disloyal parts of the military joining with the militias to coup our leadership. We have to secure our government buildings if the rightists are planning to strike."
 NIK.180.a:0 "It might be too late."

 NIK.181.t:0 "Uniting the Party"
 NIK.181.d:0 "It had been done. The Komi Republic was no longer under the control of shaky coalitions and governments guaranteed to fall, but under the strong and wise leadership of the Left. And, thankfully for Boris Ponomaryov, he was at its helm. Being the General Secretary of the party, by extension he could be considered the effective leader of Komi. However, many knew that in reality, Suslov was the true puppet master, the one truly in control.\n\nGaining the full trust and support from the entire Left was not as easy as one may think, for the movement had to face factionalism around its most powerful leaders. More specifically, Ponomaryov considered the two largest factions he could approach in his search to stabilize his rule: one was the followers of Svetlana Bukharina, the daughter of the former Soviet leader, that seemed to be asserting her position as an actor independent of Suslov. Another faction he could ally with was the supporters of Zhdanov; he seemed to be aiming for a socialist alternative, and had a significant following. Of course, he could stay far from both, but allying either one could give him the influence he needed."
 NIK.181.a:0 "Ask for more support from Suslov."
 NIK.181.b:0 "Zhdanov is more approachable these days."
 NIK.181.c:0 "Bukharina should be indulged - she is too useful to waste."

 NIK.182.t:0 "The Connections"
 NIK.182.d:0 "Zhdanov was in his office when he learnt of the rendezvous with the new figurehead of the country, Ponomaryov. While he had some reservations about him, he was still a leftist, and perhaps he could secure a position of power by supporting him.\n\nA few hours later, the new General Secretary entered Zhdanov's office. Quickly, he got to the point of why he was there in the first place. "I am well aware of the role you played in Voznesensky's democratic government some time ago, and I am sure you gathered ... important lessons from that, as well as made some friendships with your former "allies." For the good of the republic, could you perhaps contact them, and maybe make some deals or remind them of earlier favours you had done for them? We could use some more loyalty by this nation's army."\n\nZhdanov looked hesitant at first, but quickly realized the opportunity this presented. His reply was short: "Of course, Comrade Ponomaryov. I'll see what I can do for you." Minutes later, the General Secretary left, and Zhdanov quickly picked up the phone. He had a lot of convincing to do."
 NIK.182.a:0 "Pull some more strings."
 NIK.182.b:0 "This, of course, is not our first priority."

 NIK.183.t:0 "Zhdanov's Pride"
 NIK.183.d:0 ""Yes, I understand perfectly - no, do not apologise, we are such good friends, after all. Of course the honorable Ponyomarov would benefit from raising the issue of Party Discipline in the Assembly. I believe it is to both our interests that the cause of the People be furthered, yes?" Zhdanov nodded, his trademark grin never leaving his face - it wasn't going to help him over the phone, but it helped put him in the right frame of mind.\n\n"It's been such a pleasure talking with you. Thank you, thank you again, and I hope you have a wonderful evening." As Zhdanov put down the phone, his grin flickered as if changing telescope lenses - from one frame to another entirely, while somehow the essence of the whole remained. He turned to Boris Nikolayevich Ponyamorov, standing besides him in a mirror of false affability. "It's done, comrade Ponyamorov."\n\n"As ever, I am thankful for your honesty and your dedication to serving the Republic's aims." The aims of Ponyamorov, they both meant without ever quite saying it. "Comrade Zhdanov, for such a gracious offer on my behalf I would like to offer something in return."\n\n"Oh, I could not possibly - we are both public servants here."\n\nPonyamorov leaned closer, and Zhdanov could smell the cigarette breath on his face. "I know," he whispered. "You will have what you want - I will lean in your direction." Chuckling at his discomfiture, he waved at Zhdanov, grabbed his coat and left. He'd won this round.\n\nZhdanov nodded slowly. A pawn for a bishop - a few more of these and dominance would be within reach. Taking his seat, he began to plan."
 NIK.183.a:0 "Well, we got what we wanted."

 NIK.184.t:0 "An Indiscretion?"
 NIK.184.d:0 "Boris Ponomaryov looked worried when he heard from Zhdanov for the first time since he asked him the big favor, to look into his connections to bring the military to he side of the regime. And the news were unsurprisingly negative.\n\nIt appears that the former allies and friends of Zhdanov are hesitant to support the socialists. Whether it is a personal rivalry, their alienation by the coup that betrayed the democratic ideals they stood up for, or simply their hatred of the Left, very few have voiced their endorsement of Ponomaryov and Suslov. Therefore, this effort has been considered a failure by the upper echelons of the clique in power.\n\nAs if this failure is not enough, more problems have appeared. These military and police commanders, who appear to still fiercely maintain their loyalty to the Center, have begun completely disobeying the orders they are given by the governing committee. Some refuse to fight insurgents and keep their units far from conflict, while some democrats in the police have ignored commands to arrest or execute specific political opponents. It seems the favour from Zhdanov has only backfired."
 NIK.184.a:0 "Unofrtunate."

 NIK.185.t:0 "Repurposing the Institutions"
 NIK.185.d:0 "When he was to present his genius plan in front of the committee of members of the Left Coalition, including Premier Suslov, Ponomaryov believed he had thought everything through, and that this action could provide a solution to many of the problems the newly formed government was facing.\n\n"What we need to realize is how useful the bureaucrats of the Republic can be. If you think about it, they do most of the actual, practical work, and are the ones who manage and run much of the smaller parts of the country, like gears in a large machine. However, deep down, they are all workers. Workers who must be awarded by the socialist system that works for their benefit. Thus, we need to show them how beneficial the new state can be. If we make them promises of increased pay, better work conditions, and everything else we stride for, then surely they will show their support for our side, and stabilizing our control will be much easier."\n\nInitially, many of Ponomaryov's allies were skeptical about the idea, as in their minds the bureaucracy was a remnant of the bourgeoisie that had to go away with it. However, it was an intriguing option to secure their rule. With some more convincing, the project was given the green light."
 NIK.185.a:0 "We can trust them."
 NIK.185.b:0 "We can't do this."

 NIK.186.t:0 "A Compromise with the Establishment"
 NIK.186.d:0 "In the end, the largest part of the complex bureaucracy running the Republic behind the scenes, and executing any order Syktyvkar gives them, has agreed to cooperate with the Socialists in running the country.\n\nSome communists found it disheartening that, as they said, "the revolutionaries have made a compromise with the bourgeoisie", but most have been pragmatic enough to realize the importance of this move. With most organizations and institutions throughout Komi under the influence of the government, we can use them to further our goals and expand our influence. Additionally, we have secured the support of another fraction of the population by delivering on our original promises to help the working people of the country. While it may have hurt the situation of the government, which will have to increase the payments and give some bonuses to the bureaucrats, in the end, it will be beneficial."
 NIK.186.a:0 "Excellent."

 NIK.187.t:0 "Backstabbed!"
 NIK.187.d:0 "The recent news regarding the effort to gain the support of the bureaucrats are bleak. Initially, the results of the talks with presidents and chairmen of institutions of the Republic seemed promising, and as long as we gave some significant concessions, we could possibly secure their loyalty. However, small issues began to appear, and it seems that in the end, the vast majority of the bureaucracy is opposed to our policies, and even if we give them better work conditions, they refuse to support us. It seems that this is a lost cause, and there is no reason to continue with the agenda."
 NIK.187.a:0 "We should never have compromised!"

 NIK.188.t:0 "Mistrust Abounds"
 NIK.188.d:0 "When Ponomaryov suggested the idea of appealing to the bureaucracy in search of a stable base of support in governing, no one expected for things to go this badly. Officials of the communist party have been conducting negotiations with leading members of the bureaucracy day and night for the last few days. Finding a deal that satisfies both sides has been incredibly difficult, and things were only further complicated yesterday, when the bureaucrats simply walked out of the negotiations, and refuse to cooperate with the authorities.\n\nNow, chaos and confusion dominates Syktyvkar and all levels of government in the country, as no one is quite sure what to do. We are desperately trying to salvage the situation as best as we can, but any success is unlikely. At the same time, many high-profile office-holders have resigned from their positions in reaction to these recent developments, and others are simply ignoring our authority. Let's hope this situation will be resolved as quickly as possible."
 NIK.188.a:0 "Damnation!"

 NIK.189.t:0 "Locking Down the City"
 NIK.189.d:0 "The capital of Komi was in complete lockdown ever since the first tanks left their positions to take control of the city in the name of the Left. No one could get in, and no one could get out. It was that simple, but the arrival of a small wave of refugees would complicate the situation. It was not just one large caravan, but many different ones, each coming from elsewhere. Some were coming from the north, some from the south, and some from Moskowien. Initially, they met the loyal garrisons of the Left, situated in the periphery of Syktyvkar to guard it from any possible incursions or threats. Of course, being in the middle of a coup, they were denied access. But some have resorted to more extreme means.\n\nWith only the key points around the city guarded, there have been "holes" in the security of the lockdown, and the refugees have used this to their advantage. Sneaking under forest cover or jumping over fences and barriers, many have entered the capital, desperately seeking to find shelter. The military does not seem to have this under control. What will our course of action be?"
 NIK.189.a:0 "Lock them in!"
 NIK.189.b:0 "Let them out!"

 NIK.190.t:0 "The Trojan Horse"
 NIK.190.d:0 "Perhaps our lack of action regarding the latest refugees to ask for shelter in Syktyvkar has been a mistake. Several reports from the city outskirts have shown that, in the end, these were not innocent civilians. Apparently, many of them are affiliated with Centrist and Rightist paramilitaries and insurgency groups, and have begun to aid them in the effort to overthrow the recently established socialist government.\n\nWe had believed that our forces had managed to secure the capital, by defeating the vast majority of the enemy troops in battle or disarming them. However, some holdouts continue their operations, and these refugees have immediately moved to help them in their mission. This has evolved into a major crisis, as we are currently in risk of completely losing control to the resurging militias. The socialist government is considering the options it has right now."
 NIK.190.a:0 "We shouldn't have been so merciful."

 NIK.191.t:0 "Intensifying the Crackdowns"
 NIK.191.d:0 "One could sense the tension in the air as General Secretary Ponomaryov appeared to deliver a speech to the army barracks near Syktyvkar, as he had gathered some of the most prominent officers and paramilitary commanders. Of course, not one of them was loyal to the Center or the Right.\n\nThe speech, ignoring the socialist rhetoric and vague promises for progress and reform made, focused on one thing: all loyal units, regular and irregular, would be united under one command, and create the Red Army of the Komi Republic. Closely modelled after all such formations in the history of communist nations, its purpose would be to defend the Republic from any threats that appear, internal or external. At the end of his speech, Ponomaryov received thundering applause, and was cheered by all his allies.\n\nHowever, despite the idealistic remarks made by the General Secretary, the Red Army's goal right now is one, and it is simple: restore order to this chaotic state and ensure the proper establishment of the new regime. The question now is who to focus on eliminating first from the two major movements operating in Komi: the democratic Center, or the Passionariyy right?"
 NIK.191.a:0 "Target the right!"
 NIK.191.b:0 "Target the center!"

 NIK.192.t:0 "The Hunt for Serov"
 NIK.192.d:0 "Ever since he was first involved in politics, Ivan Serov has proven to be one of the most insane ideologues in the Komi Republic. Despite originally claiming to support Suslov, his ideas of "Ordosocialism" have convinced us that he is nothing more than a Nazi in disguise, and him becoming Gumilyov' hawk has only confitmed that. Now that we are in power, we must do everything we can to hunt him down and bring an end to his movement.\n\nThankfully, during the battles for the control of Syktyvkar, we have managed to capture many of his men who fought us as part of the small militia force they comprise. Of course, most will be fiercely loyal to Serov, but we can still try to extract key information from them, namely where their leader is hiding. Through promises of gifts and reduced sentences, our police will eventually break someone, and gain what hints it needs to begin the hunt to take down Serov.\n\nOf course, the information we will be provided by his men may not be entirely reliable, and so some alternatives have been suggested. We have several other possible sources, that although less reliable, could be honest and lead us to the traitor's hideout. Who do we trust?"
 NIK.192.a:0 "Ask the deserters."
 NIK.192.b:0 "Go it alone."

 NIK.193.t:0 "Lies and Deception"
 NIK.193.d:0 ""Lies, lies, and only lies!" That was all the chief of police of the entire Republic had to say regarding Serov's men. Going into this, we expected to get at least some valuable information regarding the group's leader, yet what happened is the exact opposite.\n\nEvery clue we received from the captured Ordosocialist troops has been blatantly false. Not a single one has given us any actual help in determining Serov's whereabouts, each one feeding us with false and contradictory locations and statements that our police has worked hard to debunk, one by one. And now, it seems we have made zero progress in taking down the pseudo-Nazis. The leading members of the party have even started debating whether it is even worth to pursue this fringe group, as what power could it really exert? Now, we have been asked to make the final decision on whether we want to continue using our unclear sources, or end this investigation entirely."
 NIK.193.a:0 "This is a waste of time."
 NIK.193.b:0 "We can take another lead."

 NIK.194.t:0 "Setting the Trap"
 NIK.194.d:0 "The chief of police burst into Ponomaryov's office, holding a stack of paper and dropping it on the table in front of him. In the chief's face, excitement and joy could be seen, as if he had figured out something. Quickly, he began to explain his master plan for capturing Serov.\n\n"Comrade, I have found the solution to all our problems. Instead of hunting down Serov, hoping we eventually catch this mysterious man, we must lure him in. He will always find a way to escape if we merely chase him, but if we get him in the perfect position, we could strike and have the upper hand." The chief paused for a second, clearly to see what Ponomaryov's reaction would be. Then, he continued.\n\n"I have planned it all out. The story to lure Serov in will be a meeting of Ordosocialists, to discuss their survival and their operations against our government. However, it will all be a cover. The meeting will be held in this warehouse to the south of Syktyvkar", he said pointing at a map. "In the building, a special team of agents will be hiding, and once Serov meets his alleged allies, we will strike and take him down easily. So what do you think, Comrade General Secretary?"\n\nPonomaryov gave his reply. "If my comrades in the Party approve it as well, then it has the green light.""
 NIK.194.a:0 "Time for action."

 NIK.195.t:0 "Serov Reveals Himself!"
 NIK.195.d:0 "Serov quietly approached the door of the warehouse, careful not to make noise. He knocked on the door five times, as he had been told to do by his allies organizing the meeting, and the door opened. In front of him was not a face he recognized, but he imagined it was one of the men in his paramilitaries or the lesser known ideologues in his faction.\n\nThe man quickly gave an explanation as to who he was, and what the meeting was for. Serov walked in, and saw the table, around which about two dozen people were walking and discussing. He greeted everyone, and told them to sit down for the meeting.\n\nIn a dark corner, someone talked on a radio. "Target has entered the building. Over." The squad prepared to make their move, and kill Serov once and for all."
 NIK.195.a:0 "Kill him."

 NIK.196.t:0 "The Counter-Strike"
 NIK.196.d:0 "Serov cautiously approached the warehouse, and to his ignorance, several agents loyal to the socialist republic were closely watching him. Every step he took seemed to be calculated in his mind, and nothing was random. When he reached the door to the building, he knocked on it five times, just as his followers had informed him earlier. He entered, but was greeted not by faces of his allies and soldiers, but by gunfire. As he ducked for cover, Serov yelled something that no one could hear amidst the loud sounds of the weapons firing. But soon, seemingly out of nowhere, over a dozen of his men appeared, and went on the counter-offensive.\n\nQuickly, Serov's men began to encircle the building. Some of those pretending to be his allies tried to flee before being captured and suffering the payback for betraying him. Many stayed, protected by the government squad, but even though the trap was specifically designed to succeed, the tide turned in Serov's favor. By the time the sun had set, the gunfire had ended, and no loyal Suslovite remained in the building. Some had even been taken as prisoners, and no one could imagine what the Ordosocialists would do to squeeze information out of them. The trap, originally thought an ingenious plan, had ended in complete humiliation for the government."
 NIK.196.a:0 "We will have to try something else."

 NIK.197.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.197.d:0 "Within seconds, the squad ran out of the basement they were in, and stormed the meeting. Everyone ducked for cover, as bullets grazed past them and wreaked havoc. One man, Serov himself, once thought a mastermind by some, sat there in confusion. He had fallen for one of their simplest tricks.\n\nThe squad spread across the warehouse, and two of the men blocked each entrance and exit. Serov, having no other choice, ran behind a large wooden box and hid from the shooters. He stayed calm for one second, but immediately the sound of gunshots tearing through the wood made him panic. One of the bullets barely missed him, instead flying into the wall behind him. There were now few things for him left to do. He thought of ways to escape,but it seemed there weren't any.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted when a bullet went through his back, fatally injuring him. He dropped down, and his body was soon found by the police squad. Finally, Serov was dead, and with him, so was his absurd Ordosocialist movement."
 NIK.197.a:0 "The traitor is finally dead."

 NIK.198.t:0 "The Perfect Source"
 NIK.198.d:0 "It appears that we have found the best lead we have on Ivan Serov, and that is his men. The prisoners of war captured with our clashes with the Ordosocialists have proven to be an excellent source of information. We obviously expected them to be knowledgeable on Serov and his remaining men, but were surprised by how easily they gave up information. Perhaps they were not as loyal as we originally thought.\n\nWe have already received a detail on Serov's residence that is more or less accurate. He lives near the suburbs of the capital, relatively isolated yet close to the action. Additionally, we have been informed of the location and short-term plans and goals of what Ordosocialist troops and paramilitaries remain active. With such valuable intel, we could possibly make our hit and end this absurd ideology."

 NIK.199.d:0 "The sky was completely dark when the men entered the house. The door was easy to break through, and there was little to stop them from breaking in. However, all eight men of the squad knew this could well be one of the most dangerous missions they would ever participate in. They entered the only floor in the building and quickly spread around it.\n\nEach man took a different position, making sure to secure it. The threat awaiting them could be anything, from an actual armed person to a trap, and so everyone was careful. The first course of action was to ensure that there was no armed personnel in the building, and that was quite easy. All hiding spots were checked, and the house was declared clear.\n\nThen, the next step was to search everywhere it was possible, and find any and all evidence. With such a mysterious man, finding hints to lead him would not be an easy process. No matter what they thought, though, they did not have all the time in the world to search."

 NIK.200.t:0 "The Plan of Attack"
 NIK.200.d:0 "The Democratic Coalition's leaders have arranged a very important meeting, or at least, what was supposed to be a very important meeting. The reason for the meeting was the... unstable situation in the Republic. Extremists, radicals, and political violence ran rampant. While the death toll was relatively low from all of this infighting, the Democratic Coalition fear things may escalate, leading to coups and the possible collapse of the Republic.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears nobody can decide upon a plan of attack in regards to these fears. A number of representatives believe that the coalition should focus on the left and their dangerous revolutionary rhetoric. Others disagreed, citing the increasing violence from the right as the largest concern. A third camp within the coalition believes that all of this is unnecessary, and that we should simply focus on campaigning and winning the next election.\n\nThe debate eventually completely derailed into ad hominems and shouting matches, and it was clear to the leaders of the coalition that no progress was being made. By the end of the meeting, everyone was equally unhappy, as it was decided that the coalition will simply agree to disagree. The meeting was adjourned, the ad hominems ceased, and the politicians reluctantly returned to their homes."

What must once have been clothes hang to the side, limp and sodden with blood. Around his neck dangles the title, SOCIAL FASCISTS WILL NOT BE SPARED WHEN THE REVOLUTION COMES. The stump of an arm - surely the amputation must have been as recent as it was violent - is tied off and secured with a little Party badge. One of Vosnesensky's men, perhaps?\n\nOfficer Timorovich nods mechanically to his Deputy. "Please note: case type 24-D, class B physical trauma. Prepare for physical examination back at the morgue. No further instructions." He ambles off for a smoke, and Deputy Sadckov begins to wrap the body in medical gauze.\n\nHow long have they done this, the two of them? A dance back and forth and back again across the Republic, picking up the shredded remains of life after life to dispose of in as tasteful a fashion as possible. The Political Crimes Division is nothing more than a sick joke, and the Officers of its hopeless war are jesters in the courts of the powerful. Crimes unseen. Crimes unseeable. Crimes that are discovered and hastily covered up, as with some idiot child that might spew up some inconvenient familial truth at the dinner table.\n\nSadckov's hands tremble as he covers the eyes. He is tired, so very, very tired. And yet the charade goes on.\n\nNot far from him, Timorovich wonders why there has only been one reported murder case this week. It is a precipitous drop from previous months. He rubs his stubble, and then it hits him, like a lead-iron socket in the belly."

 NIK.202.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.202.d:0 "Ivan Serov had not been sleeping well this night. For no apparent reason, he just could not stop waking up, again and again. But that was merely a mild annoyance in front of the recent events that had put his life and his ideology in danger: Suslov's puppets had taken power in a coup d'etat, and he knew they were already hunting him down. Serov walked out of his bedroom, and headed to the kitchen to eat or drink something.\n\nAs he sat in the kitchen, a sound could be heard. The door made a screeching sound as it opened, and whether it was his paranoia or not, that was a possible threat. He quickly ran down his home's hallway, and headed back to his bedroom, as loud footsteps and voices could be heard from behind. As he entered the room, he turned to lock the door, but realized that it was too late now. He opened the window to escape, and felt the wind blowing on his face for a mere second, before a gunshot was heard. Someone had shot him from behind, undoubtedly the dirty communists. Serov laid there, until his soul left his body.\n\nThe next day, a report would reach the office of General Secretary Ponomaryov, stating that, surprisingly enough, Serov had been caught in his house and killed by the appointed hit squad. Ponomaryov breathed a sigh of relief."
 NIK.202.a:0 "Thankfully, Serov is no more."

 NIK.203.t:0 "Nothing But Air"
 NIK.203.d:0 "The search in the alleged house of Ivan Serov continued all night, but as dawn came, it seemed as if no progress had been made. While his home did not appear to be a "clean" building, where any and all possible evidence was purposefully gone, there was still nothing of value for the police squad in charge of the investigation. A few notes seemed promising, but turned out to be nothing than vague ideas for yet another of his Ordosocialist manifestos and books. The bedroom and living room did not look as if someone had hastily left the house, but were tidy and in order. It was almost impossible to distinguish if this had been done on purpose, or if this was something normal.\n\nThe officers in charge of the mission were at a crossroads. What they had believed to be a treasure for information and leads on the Serov case had turned out to be completely useless. As such, many had suggested leaving the building and trying to follow one of the different clues the government had. But some still felt as if something was off, and with some more searching, the building could be useful after all."

Its content was so simple, yet so helpful to his department: "Meet behind central Pazhga café, Thursday, 3:40 AM".\n\nIt had been found in a kitchen cupboard, likely hidden at first by everything else there. But one of his men had been thorough enough so as to search there, and there it was found. The chief knew two things: firstly, that man would be getting a promotion soon. Secondly, this was so big, he could very well be presenting his findings in front of the leaders of the party in the same day. Even he himself truly hoped that, after this entire hustle, Serov could finally be caught and face the consequences of his crimes."
 NIK.204.a:0 "Let's head to the meeting."

 NIK.205.t:0 "Ambushing the Ordosocialists"
 NIK.205.d:0 "Everything was in place for the perfect ambush. The days of hard work to track down one of the biggest political opponents in the socialist republic of Komi still at large had finally paid off. The note found in Serov's house had been enough for the government to follow on this lead, and prepare an attack on Serov at the scheduled meeting. After all, what did they have to lose from this?\n\nThe hit squad was composed of fifteen members, all coming from the army and experienced in battles, albeit usually ones between paramilitary units in the streets of Komi. Amidst the darkness of the night, they arrived in the small town of Pazhga in a dark black truck, going unnoticed by the local population there. In the dark road behind the city's largest café, which would certainly be empty at the time the meeting would be held, they prepared their positions. They hid behind walls and windows, or remained somewhere further away, ready to be called in by radio the instant the traitor made his appearance.\n\nAs the hour of the meeting came closer, the chief of squad, who had been obviously assigned responsible for organizing the ambush, had to make up his mind on what the optimal attack would be. He knew quite well that this could even be a trap for the Komi Red Army to derail their efforts. Thus, he had to inform the squad how hard to attack."
 NIK.205.a:0 "Ambush him with everything we have!"
 NIK.205.b:0 "This could very well be a trap..."

 NIK.206.t:0 "The Traitor Lies Dead!"
 NIK.206.d:0 "For once, good news have come out of the Serov investigation. And the news couldn't be better, as that investigation is officially closed.\n\nAs it turned out, the meeting in Pazhga was not a delicate trap, but an honest action by Serov, who did not know we were planning to make our strike there. When he arrived at the specified time, the squad hidden in the road was easily be able to hit. Serov was caught wih his guard down, only having very few men with him, and so we managed to kill them all, including the traitor, and leave the area with very limited casualties.\n\nWith Serov dead, the figurehead of the Ordosocialist movement is gone forever, and no one is likely to replace him. His followers turn to other groups or flee the country, and his paramilitaries scatter in the countryside, only to be hunted down by the Komi Red Army. The Serov case has been deemed an absolute success."
 NIK.206.a:0 "We no longer have to worry now."

 NIK.207.t:0 "The Ambush Fails!"
 NIK.207.d:0 "The latest developments in the Serov case are not beneficial for the government in control of the nation. It appears that Serov was prepared to repel our ambush, and go on the counter-offensive.\n\nOur men initially seemed to be performing well, according to the reports of the surviving troops, but the traitor soon brought in his reinforcements. At around the same number as our own squad, they quickly dealt with the mild annoyance presented, and held back the enemy, while Serov managed to flee the area and move to an unknown location. While the Ordosocialist have still not been dealt with after this fiasco, at least the casualties of the "battle" were few for our own side."
 NIK.207.a:0 "That's something."

 NIK.208.t:0 "The Ambush Fails!"
 NIK.208.d:0 "The ambush planned against Serov in Pazhga could not have gone worse. In all likelihood, the Ordosocialist leader had left the note on purpose, and as such was completely aware of what was coming for him. When our troops came out of their hiding spots, and tried to kill him, he fought back.\n\nFrom other dark corners and streets, Serov's paramilitaries emerged to protect him. Unprepared for such a coordinated defense by their enemy, that was supposed to be coming alone or with a small guard, our own squad was not able to cope with the problem. They fought bravely to maintain their positions and safely withdraw as Serov escaped once again. What's worse, perhaps, is the consequences of this skirmish. The reports claim that a rocket grenade launcher was used by the enemy forces against the squad, causing a massive explosion in the road. Unfortunately, our entire squad died from the blast, and so did 17 innocent civilians that were in the nearby building, which collapsed from the blast as well. Few know of what actually happened in Pazhga that night, as we have covered up the story, but Serov still remains free, roaming the country."
 NIK.208.a:0 "This has been a complete failure."

 NIK.209.t:0 "An Empty Room"
 NIK.209.d:0 "Nikolai sat on a chair, one of the few things the room still had, to contemplate what was happening. For hours now, the house had been turned upside down. Every object had been examined and looked under, and every possible clue that could lead the police to something closely investigated. But, no matter how many men had worked hard throughout the day, absolutely zero progress had been made. Not a single clue had been found.\n\nIvan Serov was a mystery. Perhaps it was his time in the secret police, but he certainly knew how to hide, and he did it well. What worried Nikolai, though, was the reaction of his superiors. What would they think when they learned that he and his co-workers had found a dead end in one of the most important investigations in the history of the socialist regime, as short as it was?"
 NIK.209.a:0 "There is no way to continue."

 NIK.210.t:0 "The Socialist Alternative"
 NIK.210.d:0 ""Greetings, proud citizens of the Komi Republic! My name is Andrei Zhdanov, and you may know me as one of the leading figures of the Left political alliance. Much speculation on the future of this country has occurred, especially following the dissolution of the former regime. However, I have decided to broadcast this message to national radio, to tell you that a bright future is ahead for us."\n\n"Many of you have constructed an image of what a Republic ruled by Suslov's Socialists would be, but these premature conjectures are much different from what awaits it. I, as the General Secretary, will from now on be the leader of this country, dictating its policies and hearing the voices of the people, and from this position, I must inform you that the Suslovite plans will not be fulfilled. What the new government has to offer is the Socialist Alternative. Not a single person will have to worry about falling into poverty, or being chased down by the secret police for their political beliefs. The goal we have set to accomplish is that of a free socialist state, built on the principles of liberty and solidarity."\n\n"The Alternative will be not be built on exclusion of those who do not agree, but inclusion of all who can benefit. It is an undeniable truth that the writings of the first and the greatest proponents of socialism had the best intentions when creating and spreading their ideas. No matter how much leaders twisted them in the past, we are here to rebuild this Republic, for the good of its people."\n\n"It is for that reason that I ask you to respect the state that only cares for your own good and prosperity. Do not bring about the chaos and anarchy that my predecessors could not prevent, but embrace this new opportunity. Together, we can forge a new future for Komi."
 NIK.210.a:0 "Keep it simple - keep it sweet."
 NIK.210.b:0 "The world is not enough!"

 NIK.211.t:0 "The Red Meeting"
 NIK.211.d:0 "It seemed as if Zhdanov had decided not to end any last chance he had of working with the Center. Of course, what was once the leading coalition of the Komi Republic had been scattered by his seizure of power, and so had the Voznesentsi: some had fled Syktyvkar, either to leave the country and push their agenda from abroad, or to continue resisting from the countryside of Komi. However, some members of the former President's faction had still not left the capital, perhaps because they were willing to cooperate. And Zhdanov would capitalize on that opportunity.\n\nThe Center's left wing would be approached with an intriguing chance to remain in power, and that was to peacefully collaborate. Seeing as the new leader of the county had already made an extensive effort to support Voznesensky and his people to get into power, it wasn't that hard to believed that he would use the social democrats to consolidate his rule, which was by no means perfectly stable - even though this was a common occurrence for the governments of Komi.\n\nWhat Zhdanov and his allies understood, though, was that there was perhaps an even better way to solidify their control over the violent political stage, and that was by backstabbing. Having gained the trust of the Voznesentsi, it would be more than simple to make the planned meeting, in which talks with them over a national unity government would be held, a trap. They would be in a perfect position to be arrested, and so the social democratic faction of the Center would disappear in the blink of an eye. In the end, whether betrayal was the best choice was up to Zhdanov."
 NIK.211.a:0 "I've assembled you here so that the Republic may be saved..."
 NIK.211.b:0 "Guards? Take them away."
 
 NIK.212.t:0 "Our Wayward Children Returned"
 NIK.212.d:0 "Today is a day of pride for our socialist republic of the people. As was the plan by the Zhdanov government, we held the meeting with the followers of Nikolai Voznesensky, the aim being to integrate their group into our greater base of support. The plan has paid off, as after talks and negotiations with the social democrats, they have agreed.\n\nThe meeting was held in the National Assembly building, and had to last several days as some details were sorted out regarding the nature of the "unity government". In reality, as the faction in control of this nation, we were able to exert our influence and manage to pressure the Voznesentsi into accepting a deal that favors us. For all intents and purposes, we and the social democrats are one.\n\nAs for the fate of their leader himself, Voznesensky, he has fled the Republic. Stating it is no longer democratic but under a tyranny, he is currently at an unknown location, and perhaps he is plotting his return."
 NIK.212.a:0 "He won't be relevant in the near future."

 NIK.213.t:0 "A Black Day"
 NIK.213.d:0 "Both sides of the meeting, the Zhdanovites and the Voznesentsi, could feel the tension in the room. The building they were in, what used to be the National Assembly of the Republic until it was forcefully dissolved, seemed massive in comparison with the few delegates that had arrived from the two factions to discuss.\n\nIn theory, this was a National Assembly meeting to "hold talks on the formation of a national unity government in face of the crisis the Republic was facing". In practice, it was nothing more than a meeting between a few representatives, as everyone else not part of the non-Suslov Socialists or the Social Democrats was obviously absent. Soon, though, even this meeting which seemed to show potential would devolve into chaos. Government troops stormed the building, trying to arrest all the supporters of Voznesensky. They replied in kind, using both firearms they carried with them and bringing in support from a nearby paramilitary unit.\n\nThe battle was fierce, but in the end, the small number of government troops seemed unable to cope with the unexpected arrival of reinforcements. Under cover from gunfire, the social democrats fled the building, racing to get out of the city before being caught. And it seems they have succeeded, as they disappeared, before the army reported that this group of a few dozen politicians had actually gotten across the border with the Vologda Neutral Zone, entering the neighboring warlord state.\n\nOf course, being neutral and with some democratic aspirations, Vologda has refused to hand over the "political refugees". We have given up on trying to get them under our custody again, as it now appears out of reach. All in all, this mission seems to have been a failure, and the only thing we can do now is cover up the affair from the public."

The building did not draw one's attention, cleverly disguised as a normal government building or offices.\n\nThe close associate of Andrei Zhdanov presented himself to the commander of the Squad, who bowed in respect, and quite clearly understood that this was an important case. After completing the typical proceedings and bureaucracy, Andropov was introduced to the group of thirty men handpicked by the regime to lead Plan Blue - the special operation to take the Eurasianists out of the picture. Then, he began to outline the plan to his subordinates.\n\n"I am here on behalf of General Secretary Zhdanov together with my trusted commanders to assign you a mission crucial to this Republic's future - to strike at Lev Gumilyov. On the behalf of the General Secretary, it is my duty to convey the details of this operation, codenamed Plan Wolf."\n\n"Using confirmed reports and eyewitnesses, we have located the hiding spot for the leader of the reactionaries, who is in Slobodskoy and under protection by a local paramilitary unit. This has allowed us to design a plan that, should it be carefully executed, will allow us to capture Gumilyov and perhaps many of his remaining allies, ending the threat they present. It is of crucial importance to maintain the element of surprise and find the perfect moment to strike when their guard is down. Remember, this is no simple operation - it has been assigned to you because you are considered the most capable force available. Preparations will begin shortly.""

Especially if several of their leaders and politicians were to suddenly be revealed to have fascist sympathies, or were selling paramilitary supplies to the highest bidder behind their backs.\n\nBut was seeding the files worth the effort?

An informant discovered the planted files in the trash, which means the plan has failed.\n\nZhdanov's interference was discovered, but how? Was the information contradictory? Were the files out of character for those incriminated within them? Was there a leak from one of their own? Figuring out why this went wrong could prove crucial for the success of future plans.

It's time to bring this party sky-high.\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat. The common man believes in us, even if many of us no longer do. And we have to work to keep that faith, by listening to and representing them."\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly-"\n\nShe barely hears the dull thud of the shot before a guard slams into her bulk, throwing her into the stage as the audience erupts into chaos. The gunshots continue, at irregular intervals, until they are silenced, and from the east of the auditorium muffled cries and the sound of fistfights echo.\n\nThen another burst of fire, this one rapid and shallower, from the top of the tripartite stage above her. Screams, and the distinct thud of flesh hitting lead. Stalina's world tunnels in on itself, to the narrow web of cover that leads to the exit. Grunting slowly from the bruise in her side, she moves forward, ever forward, at what feels like the pace of a snail.\n\nAs the auditorium roars with gunfire behind her, Stalina keeps her face set, only allowing herself the pleasure of a single thought."

It's about as much as she can ask for these days, and it's not a bad life, all things considered.\n\nAt least this Stalina fellow who's yammering on the radio is a good orator. She tunes the rusty dial up a little, strains her ears:\n\n"And it will not be the dream of Prince Vladimir or Vladimir Lenin that keeps this Republic moving forward, but the dream of Vladimir the janitor, Vladimir the factory worker and the bureaucrat.

Things have changed, and mostly for the better, haven't they?\n\n"Extremism doesn't solve problems, friends of the Assembly. We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nVolkova finds herself clapping, for some strange reason, as the speech concludes in a roar of applause - and her thoughts stray to the old passport she still keeps in her closet, signed by Voznesensky himself in the old days.\n\nPerhaps she'll think about voting again, the next time elections come around - and she knows where the future, and her confidence, truly lies.

We do. And if we stop believing that is true, this Republic will soon disappear into the bloodshed from whence it was formed."\n\nThere is emptiness on both ends of the radio this time. The crowd continues to whisper, but there is no hint of celebration, agreement or even vague positivity. It is as if the speech had been given over a dead mike - the crowd certainly doesn't seem to have heard anything.\n\nAs the audience disperses, Grigorenko winces and prepares to leave.

With this in mind, there are two prevailing ideas we can attempt that would see this situation flip. The first is simply to cede the majority of the territory, which we'll never be able to patrol completely, in order to build up defenses and fortifications in crucial government buildings and factories. From there, we can begin sending out combat groups to put down any potential rebellions.\n\nThe second plan is more offensive, the idea is to send out pacification teams to quash rebel activity in the more rebellious neighborhoods BEFORE any dissent can form.\n\nWhatever we choose, we must do so quickly."

In order to learn these details, we must raid the headquarters of the Communist Party and Shafarevich's Passionariyy. Those locations are public knowledge, and informants within these buildings can help us find useful intel.\n\nWhile conducting these raids, we have two options for our strategy. The first strategy is to grab only what information our spies can verify, so that we avoid any contingency plans and false intel the enemy may have planted. This is the less risky option, but it also requires more time, and will result in less information being gathered. The other strategy is to grab as many files as we can, sort out the contents, and act upon whatever useful information we happen to come across. This will result in more information being gathered, but is obviously riskier. If we come across false intel, our forces could end up stumbling into a trap. The question is, which strategy do we employ?"

If we don't act upon this information right away, the enemy will be fully-equipped for a coup. We need to seize these weapons and commanders immediately, anything else is a dangerous waste of time.

If we could seize these weapons and commanders, we could cripple the radicals and ensure the safety of our government. We need to act quickly, however, since it will only be a matter of time before the enemy realize we've received this intel. If we wait too long, all of this information will be useless and we'll have simply wasted our time.

 NIK.247.d:0 "Sergei opened yet another drawer of yet another filing cabinet. Sergei hated patrolling the city, what with all of the violent paramilitaries roaming the streets, but this assignment was a truly special kind of hell. It was past midnight, and Sergei had spent the last several hours reading mind-numbing documents with a barely functional flashlight. Occasionally they had to drop everything and hide when a car approached the building, but none of the cars ever stopped in front of the building.\n\nFinancial reports, predictions for upcoming party primaries, complaints about cuts to the catering budget, and meeting transcripts about said catering budget complaints. Polls on how voters reacted to different buzzwords, pages and pages of ideological debates, and disappointing salaries filled up each and every filing cabinet in this God-forsaken building. How could someone fill up so many folders with so much irrelevant nonsense? How was it also so disorganized? Sergei swore there was no rhyme nor reason put into what document went where, and Sergei now understood why people complained so much about rising paper prices in Syktyvkar. This was just an unnecessary amount of documents.\n\nThey had been in the building too long, they had to move on. Sergei stuffed several folders of financial reports, and various other documents that seemed especially useless, and just hoped the radicals happened to have the most amazing encryption code in Russia. Maybe some government bureaucrat can find something of value in this pile of trash."

The operation would be a multi-pronged attack, with squads being deployed across Syktyvkar and the surrounding countryside. Some locations had to be ignored, due to manpower and resource constraints, but the majority could be struck in a reasonable amount of time.

If the intel was correct, then it should have been a decisive blow against the radicals, and a great victory for the Republic. Such a victory could have secured the government's position and ensured democracy's survival.\n\nExcept the intel was wrong.\n\nThe radicals had been expecting the Republican forces to conduct a raid on their files, and had planted false intel. Those locations that were correct and not simply decoys had been fortified and staffed with paramilitaries. When the Republican forces reached these locations, the paramilitaries opened fire upon them.\n\nHeavy losses were sustained, and the Republican forces were sent into disarray. Meanwhile, the cells not present in the false intel or that were simply ignored mobilized. Now radical cells were rising up across Komi.\n\nThe Republic has failed."

Using the invaluable intel gathered from the radicals, the Republican forces were able to strike at the perfect moment, catching the radicals off-guard. The radicals' paramilitaries were in the midst of mobilizing as Republican forces opened fire, preventing them from properly arming or establishing a credible force. We've also arrested or killed some of the more experienced paramilitary commanders, crippling their forces' ability to organize. It seems the radicals had been expecting an attack, but our forces must have prepared faster than they had predicted, considering how unprepared the enemy was. Even if we didn't truly possess the element of surprise, we still dealt a huge blow to the radicals' ability to strike against the government. The radicals should be unable to carry out an effective coup. We can breathe a little easier now that our democracy has been secured for now."

 NIK.251.t:0 "Their Forces Diverted!"
 NIK.251.d:0 "While we have seen great success with our raids, and the enemy forces seem to have been devastated. However, we have surely not secured every arms cache in Komi, and given time the radicals will surely be able to muster enough forces to carry out a coup. At the very least, our raids mean they can't rise up immediately, and we have likely significantly delayed their plans.\n\nThe time we've bought with these raids is precious. We must use them to further secure our position, further prepare ourselves for possible coup attempts, and further consolidate our rule by other means. While these raids are successful, raids alone can't save our republic. The radicals will also learn from this raid, and will likely better secure their intel and weapon stockpiles. They have been wounded, but their wounds are certainly not fatal. We need to invest in propaganda, we need to introduce reforms, and we need to win over the Komi's citizens. If we can get the civilians to feel safe and support us, the radicals will lack enough support to strike against our government. That is how democracy survives."

 NIK.253.d:0 "At first, there were only scattered reports. Right-wing paramilitary leaders attacked in their homes. Businesses broken into in the dead of night, their inventories seized in "proletarian expropriations". Mass spontaneous rallies against the police, with officers temporarily pushed out of entire neighborhoods. As more and more incidents rock Syktyvkar, the communist threat is becoming increasingly clear. There has been an undeniable upward trend in leftist violence in recent days; we have a crisis on our hands.\n\nThe communists have always been a major element in Syktyvkar's street politics, but the political turmoil of the past few weeks has given them an opportunity to drastically expand their operations. In the face of democratic failures, their support has grown and radicalized. A sizable amount of the leftist fringe has been violent in the past, but the audacity of these new attacks on Komi's elite and government is unprecedented. As they might say, we are rapidly approaching a "revolutionary situation".\n\nWhile their challenges to our authority are disturbing, the communists have not made overt threats to the Presidium as of yet. Vigilance is necessary, but we must be careful not to overstep our bounds, lest we give the left an excuse to escalate tensions to the breaking point."

 NIK.254.t:0 "Leftist Attack Police Station!"
 NIK.254.d:0 "Residents of central Syktykvar were rudely awakened last night by the sounds of yelling and breaking glass, as members of a left-wing paramilitary waged an all-out attack on a local police station. According to witness reports, the incident occurred shortly after midnight. Somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five masked youths armed with bricks and batons stormed the station, breaking windows and assaulting the outnumbered officers. Two officers were hospitalized, but the attackers ignored non-police personnel. Owing to the time, the station was significantly understaffed; investigators believe the operation was meticulously planned to maximize chances of success.\n\nThe instigators successfully fled the scene, but two were recognized by neighbors and subsequently brought into custody. The police have identified them as Anatoly S. and Bogdan P., members of the Workers' Street Battalions, a local ultra-left paramilitary loosely connected to the Communist Party. Both have refused to assist officers with the investigation. Judging by the coordinated nature of the operation and its members' discipline, the possibility exists that this attack was ordered by Party higher-ups as a show of force, rather than being an impulsive move by radical "lone wolves"."

 NIK.255.d:0 "Driving in Syktyvkar, with its poorly kept roads and tendency towards street violence, has never been easy. Cars tend to be reserved for businessmen and politicians, people who value privacy, speed, and security in their travels and have the money or connections to get the best possible transport. This makes road travel prestigious --as well as a target for those who seek to destabilize the Republic.\n\nThree days ago, a simultaneous detonation of several explosive devices on roads and bridges in central Syktyvkar paralyzed the city for several hours, as first responders were unable to reach the scene. Despite the devastation caused by these bombings, the perpetrators appear to have attempted to minimize casualties; the explosions occurred in the middle of the night, and the primary targets were the roads surrounding the Presidium building and several prominent local businesses. However, they still claimed two lives, and five other people have been hospitalized. The bombers are currently unidentified and remain at large, but the targeting of local elites suggests that they belonged to radical leftist movements.\n\nThis is a sobering day for the Republic. The bombings took Syktyvkar's already beleagured police force completely by surprise. Justice becomes less likely with each passing hour, while the militant Communists become ever more organized."

 NIK.256.t:0 "Paramilitaries Ambushed!"
 NIK.256.d:0 "Komi's myriad feuding political organizations have often come to blows. Bloody noses and broken bones are a common sight after weekend street rights between the competing paramilitaries of the far left and far right. These clashes are rarely lethal, which makes the recent murder of several paramilitary commanders all the more shocking.\n\nUsing military-grade weaponry, a leftist radical has assassinated three lieutenants of a street fighting group associated with our government's forces. The boldness of this assault is unprecedented; the victims were ambushed outside of a local restaurant, where they had been having lunch, scarcely past noon. The attacker threw a grenade at the establishment before gunning the men down with a machine pistol. He was himself killed in a shootout with their bodyguards shortly afterwards. Officers were able to find his identity, that of one Vasily K., and determine his political affiliations through his possessions, which included The Communist Manifesto, but he has no clear connections to the Communist Party or local leftist groups. This suggests either that he was a lone wolf or that he was very good at covering his tracks.\n\nReports are already coming in of escalating tensions between active militias, as both sides prepare for the possibility of revenge killings and a spiral of violence. The situation on the streets is becoming ever tenser, and law enforcement seems powerless to stop the killings."

 NIK.257.t:0 "Church Burnt to the Ground!"
 NIK.257.d:0 "Any person with even a grain of political literacy is aware that the far left has always had a tense relationship with organized religion. Komi's communists have been vocal in their displeasure at Christianity, especially as churches became bolder in their activity with the withdrawal of the WRRF from Syktyvkar. In past days, this mostly took the form of angry rallies outside religious institutions, but normality seems to have ascended to a higher plane since the beginning of our political turmoil.\n\nA church associated with Syktyvkar's conservative monarchists has recently been burned to the ground in what appears to be the most flagrant arson attack in several years. Fortunately, it was empty, the blaze having struck roughly two hours after the end of Sunday services. Officers were initially unable to find a perpetrator or motive, until the presumed arsonist mailed a letter to the police station filled with anti-religious invective and sections from The Communist Manifesto. Rumors about the arsonist and their potential future targets have spread like wildfire throughout Syktyvkar's religious community, and several prominent churches have employed police or militia guards.\n\nEven in Komi's perpetually agitated political climates, churches have largely remained safe from direct assault. The fact that previously untouchable targets have fallen under attack is a testament to the undeniable decline of political order and state power. The only thing that can be done now is pray that the situation won't degrade to an even greater degree."
 NIK.257.a:0 "Is nothing sacred anymore?"

 NIK.258.t:0 "Communist Attack on the Government!"
 NIK.258.d:0 "Despite the breakdown in order on the streets of Syktyvkar, many politicians believed government buildings would be spared. The Presidium would simply be too risky of a target, and, no matter how swamped with cases, the police force would be tireless in pursuing any would-be assailant. It is clear now that they were tragically mistaken.\n\nThe clock was scarcely past ten last morning when the sound of mortar shells hitting the Presidium building badly rattled Syktyvkar's residents. Communist militiamen posted on a nearby building had timed the attack precisely to when as many moderate and conservative politicians as possible were inside the building. Thankfully, there were no deaths; security was well prepared and the evacuation went smoothly. The vast majority of the Communist Party was curiously absent at the time, although its leadership has completely denied knowledge of the events and pledged to fully cooperate with the police investigation. Many in the police are skeptical, but the crisis-level criminal situation has made them completely unable to coordinate a serious inquiry. Communist presence in many of Komi's neighborhoods has reached the point where they can credibly challenge the police, and few are eager to see what would happen if they clashed openly.\n\nThis attack has completely shattered the illusion that Komi's politicians are insulated from the upswing in political violence. The only question now is whether the politics of the street will inevitably overpower the politics of the state, or if Komi's government still has a leg to stand upon."
 NIK.258.a:0 "Code Red!"

 NIK.259.t:0 "Fascist Attack on the Government!"
 NIK.259.d:0 "As if the attacks from the left were bad enough, the government is now facing serious challenges from the other direction. Right-wing violence has often taken the backseat to communist militancy in the eyes of Komi's state and police forces, especially with the preponderance of left-wing terrorist attacks in the past several weeks. As they are finding out all too late, Komi's establishment have seriously underestimated the threat the right poses to the government.\n\nRadical right-wing Passionarists shelled the Presidium and its immediate surroundings with mortar rounds during a press conference, killing several journalists. By sheer chance, the blasts failed to kill any politicians, although two Communist Party legislators received light injuries. Right wing parties were not present at the events. Lev Gumilyov informed reporters that the Passionarists were having a meeting at the time, although he failed to elaborate on the reason for convening or the topics covered. Several Passionarist politicians, declining to provide evidence, allege that the attack was a false flag by police or radical leftists and completely deny complicity.\n\nWhile the journalists' families are left to mourn their dead, the government must confront the fact that it is under full assault from not one but two extremist factions. Syktyvkar's experts have little faith that the government, already struggling to contain the communists, can quickly devote adequate resources to this new crisis, but the past few weeks have shown one thing for certain: there is always a way that the situation can get worse."

 NIK.260.d:0 "The breakdown of Komi's political system is now accompanied by the shattering of order on the streets. As paramilitaries rage and the police desperately try to restore stability to the city, less scrupulous citizens have resorted to simply stealing what they need from shops and businesses.\n\nSome of these new brigands are political radicals, forcibly expropriating goods from what they see as either bourgeois thieves or plotters against the nation. Others are desperate members of Syktyvkar's poor, simply trying to survive in the midst of this turmoil. Most are somewhere in between, disaffected citizens who have lost faith in the democratic government to give them the basic necessities of life. The sheer magnitude of these lootings, their spontaneity, and their low priority given the abundance of more severe dangers to the Republic have disincentivized a serious police response, making it unlikely that many of the thousands of perpetrators will face justice in the near future.\n\nWhile not a direct political challenge to the state's security, these lootings symbolize the grave fact that many of Komi's denizens no longer respect law and order. Only time can tell whether the police's absence on the streets is a temporary case or a permanent surrender of authority, but things do not look good for the Republic."

What can only be described as a sick glorification of violence and martyrdom impels fascists and other such groups to charge suicidally at far stronger foes, even when moderation would be a smarter tactic. Sometimes, audacity pays off, as superior forces occupied by seemingly more important matters overlook a hidden threat until too late.\n\nA monarchist offshoot group sent shivers down the spines of Komi's citizens and police force recently when it seized a fortified arsenal in central Syktyvkar and made off with a great quantity of firearms and explosives. Despite being outnumbered significantly by the police, the right-wingers' ferocity and their use of ambush tactics made the attack a massacre. Ten police officers were killed, with at least twice as many wounded, with only a single assailant killed in response.\n\nNow even more heavily armed, Komi's right-wing will likely continue its bloody quasi-insurgency against the state. These days, it seems as though the government is but a sheep surrounded by slavering wolves, with no way to escape or punish these vicious enemies."

As the republic teeters on its foundations, fascist groups have extended their reach throughout the city of Syktyvkar, carving out a safe haven for their brand of violent activism.\n\nIn another worrying showcase of how little the law seems to matter to some of Syktyvkar's less savory residents, far-right groups associated with Sergei Taboritsky's monarchist movement occupied a government owned public housing block, ejecting members of the community and seemingly converting the establishment into a fascist stronghold. Armed paramilitaries stand guard around the clock, leaving the police seemingly powerless to take the building back for the citizenry. One can only guess what is taking place behind those walls, but the streams of rightists moving in and out of them suggests that the center is being used for training, coordination, propaganda operations, or other such activities.\n\nIt is always worrying to see the far-right gain ground, but such aggressive moves suggest that the fascists are preparing for crises yet to come. The state cannot afford to ignore them for even a moment."

 NIK.263.t:0 "Fascists Seize Arms Stockpile!"
 NIK.263.d:0 "As the weeks go by, Komi's fragile order seems on its deathbed, and the vultures are circling only closer overhead. The far-right and far-left's attacks on democracy have only increased in severity and frequency, and without clear leadership or the ability to preserve order the state is unable to mount an effective response. The extremists smell blood in the water, and they will ruthlessly tear Komi apart to install their agendas.\n\nThe far-right's adventurism has only escalated, as they use the spoils of earlier raids to go after bigger targets. A recent attack on a weapons storage facility led to the Passionarist perpetrators making out like bandits, humiliating the police in the process. The pitched battle killed more fascists than officers, but they still got their prize: a cache of military-grade equipment that could easily be put to use performing more mayhem in the streets.\n\nAs losses continue to roll in for the police, many of Syktyvkar's residents are beginning to wonder whether they can rely on anyone, other than themselves, to protect them."

The police and the politicians are the greatest targets, but ordinary people can find themselves the victims of terror and madness without any notice. The fascists are particularly culpable in this atmosphere of dread, since they target civilians indiscriminately in their mad attempts to purify the city.\n\nCitizens on their morning commute were very nearly the latest victims of right-wing violence, as unidentified members of the Passionarist movement planted a bomb on a local streetcar. Only luck prevented shrapnel from ripping through over twenty people; the device, an improvised explosive made from spare parts, failed to detonate. The police are hard at work searching for the culprits, but the remote nature of the operation makes finding them unlikely.\n\nTo say the police caught an enormous break would be an understatement. If things had gone only slightly differently, there would be an enormous scandal on the government's hands. The far-right will surely not stop its terror attacks after this defeat, and all the Republic can do is hope that its good fortune does not run out."

 NIK.265.d:0 "Komi's population has never been content to bottle up its discontent in silence. Rallies, strikes, and mass gatherings are a common sight on the streets of Syktyvkar. There are many in the city who feel as though the Republic's leaders have failed them, and in this political moment that number has steadily grown.\n\nProtests that once numbered in the hundreds now number in the thousands. A blistering array of demonstrations, some planned by a community or labor organization and some completely spontaneous, have paralyzed the central city, as citizens demand higher pay, better conditions, police protection, and other vague yet intense demands. Most are relatively peaceful, but some have broken out into full-fledged violence, overwhelming the thinly stretched ranks of the police.\n\nPoliticians, relatively isolated from the chaos consuming the streets, are starting to feel the pressure. Komi's already very serious problem with radicals will likely only worsen, as a greater quantity of people becomes convinced that violence is the only way to alter the system. Among the nervous ranks of the elite, one thought predominates: if this continues, the Republic's very future may be at risk."

 NIK.266.d:0 "What are the law, justice, or government other than products of a mass popular consensus? All it takes to destroy even those institutions that seem immense and all-encompassing is a gradual loss of people's faith in them. Komi's institutions are new and brittle, and in the face of a crisis of legitimacy they are starting to shatter.\n\nThe public attitude towards authority has changed noticeably for the worse, much to the chagrin of Komi's police and elected officials. Neighborhoods have walled themselves off, driving away officers and relying on each other (and sometimes radical paramilitaries) for security. The message is clear: the people no longer trust the government to help them.\n\nIf Komi's government is to survive in its current form, it needs to reaffirm to the populace that it is able to protect them. As the slow collapse of police authority in much of Syktyvkar confirms, the Republic is a long way off from earning back the public's trust."

 NIK.267.d:0 "Excerpt from Internal Security Bureau, Kotlas Working Group Report To Central Committee, XX-XX-19XX\n\n...causes for the present uptick in virulent sentiments towards the Republic are unknown, although some fairly quick ideas can be surmised. There is the matter of our recent occupation, which has been neither gentle nor accepted in the eyes of the occupied, and there is also the matter of our perceived political weakness. Needless to say, our checkered history has not brought any confidence to the masses here; the other day one of our members overheard the re-enactment of a recent coup-attempt in the streets, complete with bawdy and inappropriate rhetoric towards our nation's leadership.\n\nWe have also attached photos of recent demonstrations; as you have most likely already heard, the latest series of protests involved effigies of senior government figures. Efforts to trace the ringleaders of these demonstrations have proved futile, but in truth many of the activities performed in these photos are likely to be spontaneous: after all, it does not take a political provocateur to light a petrol-soaked doll on fire. The rampant violence in the wake of these protests on civilian governance institutions, however, are believed to have been pre-organized, and our garrison has been ordered to secure the culprits and make their punishment public...\n\nSummary: Situation in Kotlas slowly worsening - occupation policy main cause. Strategic options limited, perhaps non-existent, given present circumstances. "

 NIK.268.d:0 "It is hard even to name the disparate groups that are gathered to the fascist movements of Komi, so scattered are their organizations: even so, it is hard to argue with numbers, the most certain metric of threat. By this metric the crowd that has gathered around the Communist Party Headquarters of Syktyvkar have become more than a mere threat: they have become an organized danger to the Headquarters' occupants.\n\nYelling the names of Gumilyov and Shafarevich, the mob holds aloft posters declaring their unabashed love for Passionaryy and their equal hatred of the State. Agitators shouting into microphones only amplify the chaos as they fan the flames of a thousand hatreds. Rage at the Government's latest policy maneuvers, the nationalisation of industries, and the abhorrent Marxist filth that has gotten into the public education system coalesces into a single turbid mass of discontent with the status quo. As the sun sets to the west, the crowd only grows in numbers and in fury - Party members attempting to reason with them are forced back and spat upon.\n\nA febrile brew of hatred, waiting for a spark - and with a single gunshot the whole edifice is set alight.\n\nNo one knows who fires the shot, or if the Government, or Passionaryy remnants, or outside agitators, is behind the escalation. In a sense, it is immaterial - the enraged mob reacts precisely the way one would expect an enraged mob to behave. Residents throw themselves against the walls, attempting to crawl up, and several are injured by barbed wire before the crowd succeeds in pushing a barricade aside.\n\nThe doors are locked, and the doors long since barricaded (standard Party policy), but one inventive protestor manages a parting shot.

Crowds melt and ebb and gather, viscous, ephemeral: the new youth hang on street corners, their tongues echoing all variants of political thought. Tense times. Tense city. Komi fears.\n\nTonight: hooded gazes, coming in packs, like hyenas stalking prey. Everyone sees the storm, the hail-like rain falling in the distance. They come anyway. Wordless is their engine - heart-stirrings from the crushing and cracking city. Komi is a machine, endless vistas of flesh, working like gears. They are spanners. Their time has come.\n\nPolice guards, eyes held like pistols, steady, unyielding, quietly lethal. Barriers, flesh and plywood, holding back the street. Whispers turn to talk, then to yells. Thuds echo - not thunder. Wood on flesh, unmistakeable. Points, screams, then all at once, as an orchestra slamming into a new note, a sea breaking on undiscovered tides -\n\nAction.\n\nOne, two, three shots, and the crowd overwhelms the pistoleer. As its sound fades, new ones replace it. Windows shatter like chandeliers, falling from the sky's ceiling. Here and there, trashcans lit aflame, left to roll around. New jesters for a court turned upside down. The Government. The businessmen. The army. The Jews. Suddenly all are enemies, and all must be brought to trial. Syktyvkar is a court, a trial run for the people's justice, and its citizens are vengeful judiciaries.\n\nNothing happens; rather, everything happens unseen.

 NIK.270.d:0 "Valentina fiddled with his pens, as he usually did at times of strife like these. There were many, gathered from all the four corners of Russia by collectors and tradesmen, and their nibs ranged from the thick and stylistic to the thinnest of thin. It was a forgotten art, and he was a middling collector. A quiet pride for the old factory worker - something to do with his free time, something the Government couldn't take away.\n\nToday, however, he had different goals in mind. He chose one of his largest nibs, almost the size of a vegetable stalk, and grabbed a red inkwell from his study. There was work to be done, heralded by the ring of the doorbell. He raised his hands out the window, clapping twice - "no surveillance agents nearby" - and closed the windowsill. Comrade Pushkov would not tolerate lateness.\n\nPushkov had brought the little scamp Iosef with him, out of pity or some misguided sense of duty Valentina could not say. Sighing, Valentina ruffled the little boy's hair, told him not to touch anything in the attic, and got to work on the massive canvas laid out in the living room. Touch upon touch the letters rose in brilliant Cyrillic font - WORKERS RISE UP! OPPRESSION MUST END, OR THE STRIKE WILL NOT! - and with them the little flourishes Valentina had practiced: hammers, sickles and stars seemed to take flight upon the carefully woven synthetic paper.\n\nAs the canvas seemed to fill with color and energy, Pushkov nodded. It was time to bring the little artwork into the open. Iosef skipped with excitement as they neared the crowds near the old factory, a furious mass of masked workers and angry signs. Valentina gestured rudely, and Iosef, nodding, took the banner's edge and unfurled it into the air. The banner took flight, joining the hundreds already in the air, and yells of exuberance arose from the heightened crowd. Smiling, Valentina joined in.\n\nThousands more would join the procession, and protests like it across Syktyvkar, as the industry of Komi ground to a halt. The workers' tide rose, a wave of garish red, and the Government stood helpless to stop it."

We're being attacked by men with makeshift weapons and small arms.\n\nNo one we've interviewed has been able to give us a straight answer on what they're after, but witnesses report that they were focusing more on our defences than upon the populace, additionally, a few were spotted scribbling in notebooks, suggesting that this might be the probing force before a much larger operation."

These protests have steadily escalated against our regime, and with the appearance of armed individuals within these crowds, it is clear that our government's survival is at stake. Therefore, our government has decided to send in the police, and forcefully disperse the protestors. It may become a scandal, but the lives of a few dissidents is a price we are willing to pay for stability.\n\nOur police arrived on the scene, armed and ready to disperse the protestors. When it became clear that they would not stand down, they were given the order to open fire. Except, when the protestors called for the police to 'march with us,' that is exactly what some did. A large portion of the police sent to disperse the protestors refused to fire, citing the protestors as 'non threatening.' Clearly these policemen need to be dismissed, as their loyalties are not with their government, as they should be.\n\nThe larger problem is the fact that the protests continue, and only grow in size. As they grow, our government can't help but notice that more and more weapons are appearing amongs the crowds. We need a new plan, since we clearly can't rely on law enforcement."

Now resistance cells dot the countryside, engaging in guerilla campaigns against our government and our forces. They aren't a direct threat to our government, but they are keeping us from securing our hold over Komi, and it is clear that we should have been more thorough during our coup. The most recent news to reach our government only helps to confirm such a perspective.\n\nApparently, one of our Army patrols travelling between cities has been attacked. The culprits were Republican Army holdouts, who had set up an ambush on Internatsionalnaya Street. The encounter was brief, but bloody, and our forces took multiple casualties. They were forced to return to Syktyvkar, and apparently our soldiers failed to eliminate the rebels that attacked them. We need to send a more prepared force to snuff out this holdout, and we will need to discuss the republican problem further."

Indeed, their presence is known even by passers-by who recognise them as villains.\n\nThey cause a general chaos in our republic, and although these events are limited and victims often survive, they are becoming more frequent and more deadly in nature.

Our men were tired and bitter from the cold, the only thing keeping them going was the thought of food and warmth as they approached civilization.\n\nSuddenly a piercing ring shot through the valley and our men were fired upon from battlements hidden in the wilderness' icy hills. The zip and crackle of gunfire caught many soldiers off-guard and sliced through their limbs; some of our men were chewed up completely by the opening spray of machine-gun fire. Fortunately, however, our men regrouped and engaged in this defensive skirmish with the invisible enemy, and eventually pushed on the offensive.\n\nBandit gunmen, it seemed, had surprised our brave soldiers in the hopes of stealing arms and munitions to supply their own pathetic caches scattered across the wintry forests of northern Russia. Their dead had been identified as rightist paramilitary forces; insurgents who had taken up arms in a feeble resistance against the communist government. Their 'noble' resistance took the form of these pitiful clashes, only resulting in violence and misery. Once the skirmish was over and blood had spilled red into the winter's snow, the Red Army men counted the lifeless bodies in the snow - now aware of political violence proliferating in our frontiers."

Due to the internal nature of this, no one realized that the trucks were broken until a soldier tried to start them this morning. After panicking, the soldiers realized that every truck in the fleet was sabotaged.\n\nAs this is where a solid amount of our trucks are located, this deals a heavy blow to our ability to move around troops. While an investigation has started to figure out who did this, it will certainly be difficult to find any evidence, as it seems likely that this sabotage occurred at least a few days ago."

Furthermore, it was clear that she needed to stabilize quickly, or else she'd likely be overthrown by some other faction. The Republic itself had a fair amount of resources, and proper application of said resources would probably be enough to stabilize Komi, given time. Time that she may not have.\n\nBukharina paused her musings and drank from her cup of tea. It was sweet, but not sweet enough, leaving a bitter aftertaste in her mouth. Of course, she did not have to stand alone against her enemies. There was always the option of allying herself with major figures in the Party like Suslov or Zhdanov. Their extralegal help would alleviate a lot of the strain from stabilization, and it would allow her to focus more resources on other necessary functions. Of course, there was the obvious consequence that whoever she accepted aid from would gain influence in the party, which could prove dangerous. Was it worth obtaining aid if it'd lead to her being stabbed in the back later on? Would her not leaning on the Party for help lead to her government being overthrown by someone else? Neither option was completely ideal, but hopefully she'd be able to handle the consequences of either one."

This left Bukharina with a tough choice: who?\n\nShe could align with Suslov, gaining support from the orthodox communists. However, such a move would only boost Suslov's already powerful control of the party. On the other hand, she could align with Zhdanov, but that would risk his influence growing greater as well, albeit allowing the two of them to check Suslov's power. Theoretically, she could lean on only her own people in the party for aid, but that would likely signal a huge blow to the party unity. It seemed she'd have to make yet another tough choice."

I'm sure you've all heard that one anti-communist radio station at some point, the one with the hosts who drink a lot?" Dimitri looked around, seeing nods from everyone present. "Good. It's my job to conduct a raid on that radio station and end its blaring of propaganda. Now, seeing as the situation in Komi is not exactly the most stable, we can't afford to quickly muster up troops, as such a diversion could lead to a counter-coup. Of course, if we take a long time slowly pulling troops, the Republican Guard could catch wind of it." Dimitri paused, but was left unable to continue as another officer interjected with his own idea, spiralling into an hour long discussion. At the end of the discussion, Dimitri was left with a choice: devote a fair amount of resources to the raid, or deeply plan it out, allowing for more forces to be mustered?"

Is your report finished?" Bukharina asked. Dimitri nodded. "Good. You're free to go. Enjoy the rest of your day."\n\nDimitri left Bukharina's office, happy.

She looked at the messenger, taking a deep breath and unclenching her fist.\n\n"Please leave, you can finish later," Bukharina said. The messenger left. Bukharina slammed her hand on her desk, ignoring the pain. She'd known that the fascists were absolute scum, but to steal supplies meant for innocents? Did they have no sense of care for the people at all? Civilian casualties may be acceptable losses for the fascists, but they weren't to Bukharina. She'd have to try to pull supplies from somewhere else ,or counter-raid the fascist caches to make up the loss. It would be hard, but she could do it. After all, she'd come this far, right?"

 NIK.284.t:0 "Further Escalation?"
 NIK.284.d:0 "It was calm. Fighting had been low-intensity, at best, and major raids had been nonexistent over the past few days. Bukharina was aware that no one was finished, and that such a calm period was merely all sides reconsolidating their forces. She leaned back in her chair, drinking a cup of water. While it would be easy to wait for the other factions to make a move and respond from there, now was the perfect chance to make a move of her own.\n\nBukharina saw herself with two major options. First, she could move to lock down the streets, sweeping them clean of the opposition. Such a move would strengthen the internal security of Komi, and help stabilize the regime. Of course, this move would also move her to a more defensive stance as she consolidated her power in the territory she had.\n\nThe other major move she could make was to go after the leaders of the opposition. By cutting off the head of the snake, the opposition would be left prone, allowing her to solidly beat them. However, if the assassination attempts were to fail, the fighting would escalate dramatically, leading to more bloody and risky battles. There was a third option, where she locked down the streets and went after the leaders, but such a move could easily leave her overextended and prone to a countercoup. Bukharina gently rubbed her temples as she mulled over her options."

He tried to think through the pain in his head, the sporadic gunfire interrupting his attempts. Damn it, he couldn't remember. Maybe some water would help?\n\nKosygin greedily drank a cup of water, finding that he was parched. It tasted... off, to say the least, but it had tasted that way for a while. It was of no issue to him. He began walking back to his desk, accidentally bumping into the wall. Shit, how out of it was he? Maybe he should just try to sleep? Kosygin stumbled to his room, finding that his center of balance was off. He fumbled with the doorknob, straining his eyes to focus on it.\n\nKosygin all but fell into bed, only just remembering to take his shoes off before pulling up the covers. Yes.

He'd grown too used to the sounds of gunfire, and ignored it at a critical time. The soldier escorted him into the back of the truck, and it began to move.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Voznesensky realized something. There was only one guard. Maybe it wasn't the end yet. The soldiers hadn't tied his hands, confident that they could stop him. He just needed a distraction, and then he could make an escape. Voznesensky waited, knowing that something would come. This was Komi, after all. An thunderous boom suddenly echoed, leaving Voznesensky's ears ringing. Now was his chance! He leaped forward, punching the guard. The guard's head slammed into the side of the truck. Voznesensky turned and leapt from the back of the truck, tumbling on the ground. He shakily stood up, brushing himself off.\n\nThe truck had driven off, but he had to get away from here. Voznesensky turned down the first street he could, only to see a communist tank.. He tried to step back, hoping that he hadn't been noticed. The tank moved until the barrel of the gun was pointed at him. Voznesensky closed his eyes, knowing death was at hand.

Suddenly, it all became clear to Stalina what was going on. She was walking to her execution. Was there any way she could possibly escape? Stalina looked around, desperate. No. It seemed her death was inevitable. She took a deep breath.\n\nIf anything, Stalina would face her demise with dignity. After all, what else could she do? The soldiers stopped her. One of them offered a flask, filled with alcohol. She drank much more of it than she expected. It felt comforting, as much as liquor could possibly be. Stalina closed her eyes as the soldiers pointed their guns at her. She thought of her father, of the war, of everything she had done in Komi. Maybe in the end, it would be worth it. Maybe someone would rise to bring a better world to this mess of a planet. Maybe-\n\nStalina's thoughts ended, as the soldiers fired upon her."
 NIK.290.a:0 "She died with dignity, at least."

 NIK.291.t:0 "Gumilyov Survives!"
 NIK.291.d:0 "It seems that despite our efforts, Lev Gumilyov has survived our attempt to assassinate him! The bomb meant to ignite when his getaway car started ended up failing to activate, and he managed to escape the soldiers raiding his compound, later finding the bomb. We can't conduct a follow up raid, as Gumilyov is now hidden somewhere in Komi. He has spoken out on a radio station about our assasination attempt and broadcasted it far and wide. Such a drastic escalation in the fight for Komi, combined with many of the fascists decrying our underhanded methods as hypocritical as it may seem,will undoubtedly lead to the fighting and chaos becoming more and more fierce, which could lead to us being overthrown! It seems that our struggle for communism in Komi may become more desperate..."
 NIK.291.a:0 "Damn it!"
 
 NIK.292.t:0 "The Assassination of Lev Gumilyov"
 NIK.292.d:0 "Gumilyov awoke, disoriented. He felt one of his guards shake him yet again, shouting something about a raid. Wait, a raid? He sprung from his bed, rubbing his eyes in an effort to wake himself up. He stumbled out of his bedroom, becoming more and more aware of the nearby gunfire. Shit. His guards escorted him towards the back, checking each room and hallway for a communist. The gunfire intensified, as they approached the outside. There would be hell to pay, Gumilyov swore to himself. No communist bastard would attack him and get away with it.\n\nAs Gumilyov stepped outside, he was struck by the utter pandemonium. The gunfire was constant, and although his destination was only a few steps away, it took nearly 5 minutes before he could successfully enter his backup truck. Unmarked, it was perfect for a getaway. One of his guards tried to start the engine. It sputtered and failed. Gumilyov felt a sharp pang of fear as the guard tried again, the engine again failing to start. He could feel his heart beat faster and faster. The guard tried one more time, finally getting the engine to start. Gumilyov didn't have time to feel relieved, for he was overwhelmed by a bright flash, tearing him and the entire truck to shreds."
 NIK.292.a:0 "Only ash remained."

 NIK.293.t:0 "Expelling the Radicals"
 NIK.293.d:0 "As stability returns to the Republic, it is the government's responsibility to ensure the maintenance of order. The political radicalism that brought Syktyvkar to the brink of civil war cannot continue if Komi is to be the successor of the Russian nation. The democratic coalition needs to be able to identify and deal with extremists, and to do that it needs to delve deep into the government.\n\nThe radicals would never have gotten as far as they did if it had not been for a large network of sympathizers that penetrated wide segments of society, up to and including the government. Bureaucrats on the left and the right provided covert aid and deflected blame for their crimes. For a liberal republic to function, it cannot trust ideological opponents of democracy to run it.\n\nThe age-old question of liberty or security presents itself once again. The first option is to conduct limited sweeps, retaining especially experienced, trustworthy, or repentant officials. The second is to fire even all of those who were merely associated with the extremists, if only to be sure."
 NIK.293.a:0 "Only a dictator would persecute so many political opponents."
 NIK.293.b:0 "Fire them all. It's the only way to be sure."

 NIK.294.t:0 "A Compromise Candidate"
 NIK.294.d:0 "Within the large democratic coalition formed in the aftermath of the coup and counter-coup, there are already tensions. The SMR, PSD, and DSNP are parties with great and substantial differences that are difficult to reconcile even with the necessity of a united front against radicalism. If they are allowed to simmer, these divisions may lead to the splintering of the coalition, a death sentence for Komi's fragile political order.\n\nEven symbolic overtures have value in these trying circumstances. To show good faith, the ruling party will replace the Vice President of the Republic with a representative of another party in order to emphasize the unity of the governing bloc in its respect for democratic values. As there are two subordinate parties, and obviously only one Vice President, the government will need to make a choice. Whose support is most necessary to ensure stability? Which party will have the President's ear, and which can safely be sidelined?"
 NIK.294.a:0 "Komi needs the PSD's strong hand. Choose Stalina."
 NIK.294.b:0 "Only the DSNP can placate the masses. Choose Kantorovich."
 NIK.294.c:0 "The SMR knows what must change. Choose Kosygin."

 NIK.295.t:0 "Locking Down the Government"
 NIK.295.d:0 "While radicals don't believe in democracy, they will certainly take advantage of it. Either by entering the legislature or infiltrating the bureaucracy, they undermine the government from within to foment dissatisfaction among the people. Despite the ruling coalition's hard work, all it would take is a wave of radical candidates capitalizing on a disgruntled public to bring Komi crashing back down into chaos. Until the situation is under control, they must be frozen out by any means necessary.\n\nWhile not ideal, delaying elections and suspending appointments is a must for the short term. Blocking communists and fascists from the government will, over the long term, weaken them by denying them the platform they crave, and it will allow the democratic parties the time they need to stabilize the political situation. By carefully screening candidates, the government can ensure that officials seek to serve the people over their ideologies.\n\nThe state can see far, but it can't screen everyone. Perhaps it would be a better idea to focus on shutting down just the strongest organization's attempts to infiltrate the political system, rather than needlessly diluting its power. As both the left and right rebuild in silence, it may not be so easy to tell which one is the closest to striking again."
 NIK.295.a:0 "Take down the Reds."
 NIK.295.b:0 "Don't let a single fascist in."

 NIK.296.t:0 "Outside Assistance?"
 NIK.296.d:0 "The political violence that shook Komi until recently has significantly depleted the supply of reliable soldiers. Large numbers of fighting-age men joined radical organizations and were consequently deemed unreliable for recruitment into the military. Outside of Komi, however, there is no shortage of men with many guns and few principles.\n\nVologda, with its supply of weapons and lack of severe politicization, has great potential as a source of soldiers, and a delegation of mercenaries from there has in fact already contacted the government, expressing willingness to fill the gaps in our security in exchange for generous compensation. They claim to be veterans of the West Russian War with a significant amount of experience and seemingly have no loyalties besides the pecuniary.\n\nWith anti-state sentiment as widespread as it is, mercenaries may be the most loyal force Komi can find on short notice. More importantly, the state is hardly in a position to turn them down. Nevertheless, some in the government argue that those who don't believe in its ideals cannot be trusted to protect democracy."
 NIK.296.a:0 "Komi needs every man it can get."
 NIK.296.b:0 "Our safety isn't for sale."

 NIK.297.t:0 "Traitors Among Us!"
 NIK.297.d:0 "There were those in the government who raised hell over the decision to hire mercenaries, calling it a close-minded, foolish move that would only endanger Komi in the long run. Recent events have more than earned them an apology.\n\nThe mercenaries hired from Vologda deserted only weeks after they arrived, citing low pay and unfair restrictions put on them by the state. To "compensate" themselves for their trouble, they carried off a treasure trove of loot from several of Syktyvkar's banks in the process. Their loyalty to the Republic was clearly illusory, but their military experience was very real, as they brutally demonstrated to a patrol sent out to stop them. Now, with fifteen casualties and a gaping hole in the front lines, the military situation is worse than before they were invited in.\n\nThe government will have its hands full trying to manage the public relations disaster in the coming weeks, but an even greater issue looms overhead: with too few soldiers and a clearly unreliable mercenary base, how will it defend the people of Komi?"
 NIK.297.a:0 "A military fiasco."

 NIK.298.t:0 "The Curfew"
 NIK.298.d:0 "The city of Syktyvkar has recently enacted a 9:00 PM curfew, for the sake of security and curbing radical activities. The reaction of the citizenry has been mixed to say the least. Komi's people have always had an uneasy relationship with their government, and while some dutifully obey the restrictions, others flout them en masse.\n\nThose working late shifts or making midnight shopping trips have no intention of going along with the new rules. This puts the government in an uneasy position. The curfew needs to be enforced if it is to have any effect on security, but asking already struggling people to neglect their livelihoods is obviously unfeasible. Is there a middle ground? How many restrictions are reasonable when the average person has only a small chance of coming into danger?\n\nThe opinions of the government are divided. The more liberally minded believe the current measures to be unreasonable and possibly counterproductive. Others believe them to be too lenient, and a third faction has tried to stake out a compromise, with armed escorts returning violators harmlessly to their homes."
 NIK.298.a:0 "Excessive policing will only harm public morale."
 NIK.298.b:0 "Armed escorts are both secure and flexible."
 NIK.298.c:0 "There's no such thing as too many night patrols."

 NIK.299.t:0 "Night Raids"
 NIK.299.d:0 "By this point, Komi's democratic hardliners must feel like Cassandra of Troy. Their warnings against a premature relaxation of the curfew were ignored by the government at its own peril, and they appear to have been proven right.\n\nThe decrease in policing following the lessening of restrictions caused an almost immediate uptick in violent crime and terrorism. Over twice as many incidents occur at night when compared to the period of extensive enforcement, and multiple government installations have fallen under attack by unseen elements. While concerns over the impact of heavy enforcement on civilians were understandable, they sorely underestimated the extent to which chaos still reigns on the streets of Syktyvkar. Now, as weeks of carefully earned progress start to unravel, the politicians who advocated for such measures have only themselves to blame.\n\nThe sole silver lining of this situation is a broader consensus that the government needs to take a firmer stance. If the hardliners' counsel falls on more receptive ears, future crises may be resolved with the appropriate amount of force."
 NIK.299.a:0 "Who would oppose such a reasonable lockdown?"
 
 NIK.300.t:0 "Directive 009"
 NIK.300.d:0 ""BY ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOMI:\n\nI, Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina, hereby order that all legal parties represented in the Komi National Assembly are to be bound in a formal coalition with the Sovereign Democratic Party, effective immediately. This legally binding coalition will remain in place until otherwise directed.\n\nAny member of the Komi National Assembly who disputes this Presidential Directive will be expelled from their position. Replacements will be determined by the leader of the coalition. As the leading representatives of their respective parties, party leaders who reject the coalition or publicly undermine its authority will be expelled and prosecuted for treason.\n\nAll legally recognized parties which refuse to join the coalition will be considered threats to the stability of the Republic and consequently outlawed."\n\nThe Directive complete, Stalina leaned back from the typewriter. Perhaps it could be more formal, but what was formality in these times? It certainly wasn't of any use at the moment, with the Assembly in total chaos and more than a few members dead or missing. Still, at least a semblance had to be maintained if the Republic's legitimacy was to be salvaged - for that, the PSD would need a respectable partner.\n\nA burst of gunfire in a distant street sounded through her office's sole window - a reminder of the urgency of her endeavour. A decision had to be made, lest such violence draw any closer."
 NIK.300.a:0 "Kosygin and the SMR are the only trustworthy option."
 NIK.300.b:0 "Voznesensky and the DSNP are trouble, but they remain popular."
 
 NIK.301.t:0 "Directive 011"
 NIK.301.d:0 ""BY ORDER OF THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOMI:\n\nI, Svetlana Iosifovna Stalina, hereby order that the Komi Police Force is to be placed under the direct command of the Armed Forces of the Republic. Chief of the General Staff, General Grigorenko, is appointed Acting Police Chief until the present situation has stabilized.\n\nThe Komi Police Force is henceforth to be considered an integral part of the Armed Forces of the Republic. All standards and regulations which apply to that institution shall also apply to the Komi Police Force. The extant structure of the Komi Police Force shall be maintained, pending..."\n\nThe typewriter's clacking ceased as Stalina's fingers stopped in midair. She hadn't really considered reorganization when first formulating the idea of militarizing the police. It seemed logical - why put them under military command but maintain their same ineffectual structure? She leaned onto her desk, steepling fingers in thought. Subordinating the notoriously weak-willed police commanders to reliable military officers would probably provide better results, but the success of that move could not be guaranteed; the police were ferociously independent, after all. Perhaps a slower, more... organic approach might work? Of course, that would mean leaving the police and military to sort it out themselves. There was no guarantee that would work, either. Maybe taking charge herself would be wiser after all."
 NIK.301.a:0 "Subordinate police chiefs to army officers, effective immediately."
 NIK.301.b:0 "Let them keep their ranks - they can figure out the rest themselves."
 
 NIK.302.t:0 "Police Reorganization Fails!"
 NIK.302.d:0 "Predictably, the Komi Police have proven as useless as ever. Their 'organic' reorganization has been completed, but not without days-long arguments, multiple resignations and more than a few arrests of problematic elements. The effectiveness of the police has been severely hampered by these setbacks and radical civilian elements are running rampant with the army pre-occupied dealing with the paramilitaries.\n\nThe police chiefs are back to work and have set their men to putting out the fires, but our government's image has taken a severe hit from its failure to reorganize law enforcement. It will be weeks before the police are able to quell the consequent unrest."
 NIK.302.a:0 "Our lives are on the line, you idiots!"

 NIK.303.t:0 "Police Reorganization Greatly Successful!"
 NIK.303.d:0 "Grigorenko reports that he and the police chiefs have successfully hashed out a blueprint for a smooth, rational reorganization of the Komi Police Force into an arm of the military. Small concessions have been made to appease the understandably nervous police, but we have gained far more than we've ceded from this effort.\n\nPolice detachments are now learning to work effectively in tandem with army units and friendly paramilitaries. Civilian unrest is being rapidly quelled with the police no longer having to worry about attack by well-armed radical groups, providing a tremendous boost to morale."
 NIK.303.a:0 "Blue and green, working in harmony."

 NIK.304.t:0 "A Successful Reorganization"
 NIK.304.d:0 "Grigorenko reports that the Komi Police, having accepted President Stalina's orders without quarrel, have been successfully subordinated to his officers without too much trouble. There has been some grumbling at the sudden militarization of police ranks and conduct, but they understand their duty to the Republic.\n\nBoth civilian and paramilitary radicals are being pushed back throughout the Republic, with police and soldiers working together well. There remains much for them to do, but President Stalina's reorganization has made our security forces far more effective than they used to be."
 NIK.304.a:0 "Trust in Stalina."

 NIK.305.t:0 "Directive 013"
 NIK.305.d:0 ""FROM THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOMI:\n\nThe legal right to protest is hereby suspended for the duration of the present state of emergency.

Protesters will be arrested and prosecuted on charges of endangering public safety, or treason in cases that severely hinder the work of our security forces.\n\nThe Komi Police Force is authorized to use force to disperse protests, if such action is deemed necessary."\n\nThe Directive was short and to the point; Stalina was pleased with her work and smiled as she passed the final draft to her secretary. However, her elation was short-lived as, once again, the sound of a large mob assembling outside reached her ears. Doubtless some radical sympathizer in the Assembly had caught wind of her intention to crack down on protests and spread it to the public. As of the moment she finished typing it, however, it had become law - one word to the head of security downstairs, and the rowdy plebs outside would be dispersed or otherwise dealt with. Perhaps the citizens of Komi, unsure of Stalina's leadership, could use an example to get them in line."
 NIK.305.a:0 "Break these subversives, commander!"
 NIK.305.b:0 "What difference could a single protest make?"

 NIK.307.t:0 "Mikhail Suslov Arrested!"
 NIK.307.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nMikhail Andreyevich Suslov, de-facto head of the communists in our Republic, has been successfully arrested. Our informant's tip-off was correct - the Communist Party's headquarters was not in fact abandoned. A bunker beneath the building, probably dating back to the first German invasion, was serving as their base of operations. The main entrance, hidden in the building's archives room, was sealed. Our troops were forced to resort to explosives to breach it.\n\nFortunately, the communists had not been alerted to our discovery of the bunker. They were caught completely unaware by the assault team, who met minimal armed resistance and suffered no casualties. Some of the traitors were able to escape into tunnels exiting elsewhere in the city, but Suslov himself was still in his office when our troops found him. He had to be bloodied a little before being cuffed, but is in good health and awaiting your judgement.\n\nLong live the Republic!"
 NIK.307.a:0 "Freedom's torch burns away the shadows."

 NIK.308.t:0 "Failed Arrest!"
 NIK.308.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI regret to inform you that Suslov has evaded our security forces and is now on the run. The tip-off our informant provided was correct; we successfully located the bunker underneath the Community Party headquarters. However, someone must have also tipped off the Reds to our approach. When the assault team breached the bunker, all they found were empty rooms. The armory, archives and offices were all stripped bare, leaving only things like furniture behind.\n\nThere were a dozen tunnels leading out of the bunker, exiting all over the city, so there's no indication of where Suslov might have fled to. Knowing him, he probably has several bolt-holes in every district. We've no idea where to begin searching. Awaiting further orders."
 NIK.308.a:0 "It's not easy to catch a shadow."

 NIK.309.t:0 "The Execution of Mikhail Suslov"
 NIK.309.d:0 "Frigid Ural winds drew moisture from Suslov's eyes as the bag was finally ripped from his head. Blinking and looking around, he saw his guards arrayed in a circle around him, faces stony and eyes filled with contempt. Beyond them was... trees? No, a forest. That must have been why they disembarked from the truck hours ago and continued on foot to wherever Stalina had ordered them. They had travelled by road for at least six hours, so they were clearly some distance from Syktyvkar. Yet, the President herself had not accompanied them. Perhaps the cause was not yet lost...\n\n"Gentlemen," he began. "Please, consider for a moment what you have been-"He got no further. Something hard cracked against his skull, causing him to stagger forward and bump against a guard, who shoved him back. "Shut up," spat the sergeant, who stepped forward and produced a small scrap of paper from his pocket. "Mikhail Andreyevich Suslov, you have been accused of operating an illegal paramilitary, theft of state secrets, 71 counts of blackmail, 342 counts of conspiracy to murder, one count of murder-"\n\nSuslov sputtered, words finally failing him. "Tha... this is preposter-"\n\nThe sergeant paused for a moment as someone else slugged Suslov in the side. "Thanks, Ilya. You are also accused of acting as a hostile agent and carrying out acts of espionage for a foreign power in attempts to subvert the laws and constitution of the Republic of Komi. The court finds you guilty, and sentences you to be shot."\n\nSuslov blanched, a ghost in the fading light trickling through the canopy overhead. He opened his mouth to speak - then heard the distinct sound of an AK being cocked. "What do you think you're..." The rifle cracked, but there was no sudden crunch of Suslov's skull shattering. Instead, he toppled to the ground with a gasp as the bullet punched through his tattered shirt and deep into his gut.\n\nHis world faded into a blur of browns and greens as someone kicked his glasses away and crushed them underfoot. Then the pain hit - a sudden, unbearable rising of blood and bile from the core of his body. Suslov screamed as he felt the lump of hot lead lodged somewhere beneath his stomach. "You fucking bastards! Just... god- FUCK!" The blurs of grey standing above him began to move out of sight, their footsteps muffled on the layer of moss and fallen leaves. "NO! No, don't... don't just leave me here! What-?"\n\n"That's all you get, you rat," someone called back to him as they moved further away. "Let's see you slip out of this one.""
 NIK.309.a:0 "We'll all sleep a little better now."

 NIK.310.t:0 "Lev Gumilyov Arrested!"
 NIK.310.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nLev Nikolayevich Gumilov, leader of the so-called 'Passionarists' is in our custody after some mild difficulties. As you suspected, he was still in the city itself, probably to coordinate the rightist paramilitaries. He was running his operations out of a district post office previously thought secure. Recon informed us that the building was heavily defended by concealed machine gun positions, so a stealthy approach was out of the question. We rolled up a BT-76, which drew their fire and kept them suppressed as our assault teams moved in.\n\nHeavy fighting followed the breach. Assault teams reported final tallies as five of ours wounded and two killed, with all twenty-four enemy combatants neutralized. Gumilov was cornered in the postmaster's office, but took us all by surprise when he threw himself through the window rather than be taken by our men. It wasn't much of a fall, but he was bleeding quite badly. The medics patched him up just fine - at least, once our boys had stopped kicking him for giving them the runaround. He's now in a cell with a medic on standby.\n\nLong live the Republic!"
 NIK.310.a:0 "Quite tough for an academic, isn't he?"

 NIK.311.t:0 "Failed Arrest!"
 NIK.311.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI'm sorry to say that our attempt to arrest Gumilov has ended in total failure. The rightist paramilitaries provided much tougher opposition than we expected. They might even have been expecting us. When we surrounded the old post office they were hiding in, we thought they were just cornered rats. But something went wrong - like our recon had it completely wrong. We only expected to face machine gun nests and a platoon or two, but they'd turned that place into a damn fortress. We brought in a PT-76 to take out the MGs, but they had enough RPGs to turn it into burning scrap in the space of thirty seconds.\n\nWe suffered too much attrition, got too frustrated. The assault teams got reckless and tried to advance without cover - got torn to pieces. We didn't have the numbers to keep fighting when the rightists staged a breakthrough in a couple of trucks and sped off to another district. Gumilov must have been with them, since we found some of his personal effects in the building but no sign of the man himself. I'm sorry, ma'am - we just couldn't catch up to them."

 NIK.312.t:0 "The Execution of Lev Gumilyov"
 NIK.312.d:0 ""Mind the hair," said one guard with a chuckle as Gumilyov was roughly manhandled out of his cell, banging his head on the bars on the way out. No longer appearing a carefully-groomed intellectual in a tailored suit, Gumilyov had clearly taken his brief stint in prison hard. His suit was already little more than black and white rags after the fall through his office window and the subsequent beating at the hands of Stalina's men. Did that bitch expect him to stand trial looking like this?\n\nEvery pair of eyes he passed turned to Gumilyov as he was half-dragged down the cold, dim concrete hallway. Rightist militiamen crowded into cells stood in silence, while their leftist neighbours jeered and shouted obscenities at the ragged man who had once been their most dangerous foe. "Popular, aren't you?" quipped the man holding Gumilyov's right arm. "Sorry you aren't going to have an audience for the next event. We're keeping this a low-key affair. Probably more suitable for a man of your standing, don't you think?"\n\nGumilyov didn't make a sound. Even without the gag wound tightly around his head, he wouldn't have dignified their chatter with a response. He just stared ahead into the gloom, closing off his ears to the din of the prisoners and guards all around him. Individual voices faded into an indistinct cacophony as he rounded a corner.\n\nAfter that moment, nobody ever saw Lev Gumilyov again - save for the guards who slit his throat, threw him into a shallow grave and riddled his prone form with bullets until their guns clicked empty."

 NIK.313.t:0 "Andrei Zhdanov Arrested!"
 NIK.313.d:0 "REPORT: Madam President,\n\nI'm pleased to report that Andrei Zhdanov has been captured following a series of raids on his known safehouses. After the first few were empty, we started to lose hope, but then one of the assault teams assigned to the warehouse district radioed in to say they'd got him. Funny thing, too, actually - his guards were the ones who turned him over to us. Apparently they'd had enough of him. We still had to arrest them, of course, but we've agreed not to charge them with anything. I hope you will accept that deal, ma'am.\n\nZhdanov is in a cell now - a padded one, mind you. Something's snapped in that man. He wouldn't stop ranting, so we gagged him. Kept struggling, so we gave him a beating. Got back up after a while, so we brought in a doctor who said he needed to be put in a straitjacket. That was too much bother, so we've just got him tied to a chair for now. Personally, I would ask that we deal with him as quickly as possible so he stops harassing the guards every time they walk past.\n\nLong live the Republic!"

We caught an armed individual in one of them, probably one of his bodyguards, but he hasn't said a word - just screamed a lot when we put the screws to him. If Zhdanov isn't in the city anymore, he's probably fled to the forests or an outlying village. We'll never find him if that's the case, not with so many troops and police tied up in urban areas.\n\nFor now, I've withdrawn the search parties and put them to work trying to find possible leads on Zhdanov's location.

His heels, at last, stopped dragging twin ruts through the moss and treefall as he reflexively coiled up in pain.\n\n"Christ," Abram wheezed. "Heavier than he looks, isn't he? How much further?"\n\nDaniil nodded and tried to point ahead with his right shoulder. "Just past the treeline. There's a nice drop there."\n\nThe prisoner had recovered somewhat by the time the trio finally came to a halt - enough, at least, to begin ranting again. "You don't know what you're doing!" came the undignified shriek of a thoroughly terrified Andrei Zhdanov. "You're all out of your minds! The Republic NEEDS me - NEEDS the Party! Stalina will-"\n\n"Pipe down, dickhead," muttered one of his guards - which, Zhdanov couldn't tell. "Now, uh..." There was a sound of crinkling paper and a throat being cleared. "Andrei... fuck, can't read this handwriting for shit. Whatever. Andrei Zhdanov, you've been charged with blackmail, conspiracy to murder, um... treason..."\n\n"Abram, it's just us here. You don't have to read the whole damn thing. Let's just finish him off already."\n\nBeneath the sack, Zhdanov's face blanched and his eyes bulged. Without the covering, he might have been taken for a madman. "No, please! Please, both of you, just listen to me! Stalina, that crazy bitch, she's going to run Russia off a fucking cliff!"\n\n"No," replied one of the guards. "That would be you, Comrade Zhdanov." Someone gave him a shove, and suddenly Zhdanov felt himself falling. He screamed in sheer terror - and continued to do so all the way to the bottom of the cliff."

There weren't many people who caved under pressure, even when we had irrefutable proof they'd been in contact with her.\n\nWe did get her in the end, though. One of Suslov's cronies spilled the information, said she was a threat to the unity of the Communist Party. Wonder what his boss would think of that.

In a corner, out of sight and out of mind, a truck was parked with a single wooden coffin in the flatbed. Everything else had been cleared away save for the post to which the traitor would be tied. The firing squad was silent, standing at ease yet visibly uncomfortable; they'd never shot a woman before.\n\nBukharina was led out of the cell block precisely on schedule, five minutes after the firing squad had arrived and been given time to prepare. It was best, the President had decided, for this particular operation to be carried out as quickly and cleanly as possible, given its nature. What made it distinct had not been elucidated to the warden, but he was an old servant of the law and was not given to questioning his orders.\n\nThe firing squad was brought to attention the moment Bukharina appeared. This, the warden understood the necessity of. Best not to let them be in an unprofessional mindset when the time came, unlike with the previous executions. This could be an unusually difficult task for them, given the woman's relative distance from the most extreme elements of her party.\n\nBukharina kept her eyes cast downwards as she was marched to the post and tied firmly in position. No prayer escaped her lips, and no unsurmountable terror set her to quivering.\n\n"No, thank you," she murmured with a grim expression as the warden produced a blindfold from his pocket. Stowing the strip of soft fabric, he hesitated for a moment before producing a small silver flask and unscrewing the cap. He offered it to her with an expectant look, no malice in his eyes. Bukharina smiled sadly and nodded. The warden brought it to her lips, allowing her to enjoy a deep quaff - one last taste of home before the end.\n\nThe warden replaced his flask and stepped away. The first rays of sunlight crept over the prison walls. "Firing squad!" he shouted clearly in the cold morning air. "Ready!"\n\nThe men snapped to with drilled precision. The warden's voice echoed around the yard, bouncing off the stone walls. Bukharina inhaled, deeply and slowly.\n\n"Take aim!" She exhaled, feeling the weight of years flow out of her with her last breath. Uncertainty, fear and doubt left her mind. Only clarity remained - and the sense that she had always tried to do the right thing. Others would carry her torch. That was enough for her.\n\n"Fire!""

Always a loyal follower, but never quite afraid to let his superiors know what he thinks. Leontiy doesn't reply, staring only at the mist. There are some boundaries it would be thoroughly inappropriate to cross. The sanctity of Command is one of them.\n\nAs he glares into the mist, something clicks. Those faint figures aren't trees - they must be the nearby hills. And if he can make out the hills, then - He scrabbles at his map, checking the faint contour lines. If he's lucky, he can get the shape of two landmarks down, like that one shaped a little like a loaf of bread, and the elongated ridge -\n\nLeontiy is a grown man of 37 years, and he's been in and out of barracks for his entire adult life. It takes all he has to keep himself from sobbing. He knows, for the first time in 8 hours, where he is going. His salary, and Kuzmin's, are safe.\n\nLeontiy and Kuzmin stumble into the finishing grounds five hours after that misty hill. They are among the three thousand commanders - of a total count of seven thousand and two hundred - who will survive without ejection from the Republican Army of Komi.

No one is willing to say what they really think, but all are looking to their old homes, and to reprieve in gentle obscurity. There is a time coming when they will no longer have the luxury of the former.\n\nThere is a cold silence, too, in the leadership. The options of the Republic have run dry.

As trucks enter the city limits and shots are fired, we are currently in limbo as Serov's loyalists attempt to extend their authority throughout the city - with no Syktyvkar, there is no control throughout the rest of the republic, and if not handled carefully, everything could come crashing down.\n\nThe protestors that are staring down the barrels of our guns are just as adamant about removing Serov as Serov is about removing them. However - now that the National Army is prioritizing securing the streets of Syktyvkar and cauterizing the city, the commanders of the armed forces are of two minds in how to proceed with dispersing the protestors.\n\nThe first proposal, the more obvious one, is to use the might of the Komi National Army to break the protestors, disperse them with violence and street combat. This will ensure, of course, that the army demonstrates who is in control, but it will also likely cause unnecessary death in an army already stretched for manpower.\n\nThe second option proposes that Serov and the army send civilian infiltrators, associated with the military or Serov's supporters, into the protestors and ingratiate themselves with those who organized the protests. When the time is right, the infiltrators will wreak havoc and collapse their organization. What should we do?"

Others, however, have pointed out that doing so would hurt our already-fragile control over the government.\n\nBy not negotiating with the militias in control of the arsenal, we may not have access to the tear gas that could be instrumental in suppressing these protests, but if we avoid using the gas, even if it means more pain for us now, we may gain some legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

If there was ever a time to strike and usurp the Republic in the name of the rightful Emperor of Russia, it was now.\n\nHe instructed his Court and commanders to grab the guns, the bombs, and the gas. No punches would be pulled in this crucial hour. The only question remaining for the Regent to answer was how to deploy these weapons. Taboritsky could target that cursed Bolshevik traitor Suslov, who has been directing the communists from the shadows. No doubt killing Suslov would be a wise decision, and he was most likely planning some foul operation to corrupt Syktyvkar even further. Alternatively, Taboritsky could target the centrists' 'emergency headquarters,' considering that Taboritsky's informants have located the building. Such a strike could decapitate the often irritating republican forces. Taboritsky was quite tempted to put the final nail in the Republic's coffin.\n\nWhile both factions would have to be purged so that Taboritsky could prepare Russia for the return of its rightful Emperor, there could be only one first strike. Once Taboritsky chose who to strike, the other would most likely prepare for such an attack, making the Regent's position less certain. However, he could simply choose to strike both at the same time. A comprehensive, decapitating strike that would leave little opposition in Regent's way.

Suslov's men threw their weight against the door, but it wouldn't budge from its position.\n\nThe stormtrooper on the other side of the door stood at attention, rifle raised. His makeshift barricade was working, and now all that was left to do was confirm the kills. Slowly, the shouting and coughing grew quieter, and the loud thuds grew weaker and weaker.

It was addressed to Sergei Taboritsky, leader of the Society for the Restoration of the Russian Empire, a minor right-wing faction. However, Taboritsky also had his elite stormtroopers, fanatics who would gladly die for their leader and his cause. Taboritsky was fanatic in his loyalty to Tsar Alexei II, who he believed escaped execution by the Bolsheviks. This posed a number of problems for Gumilyov. Firstly, Tsar Alexei II was almost certainly dead, so Taboritsky's mental health could be called into question. This meant he could be unreliable. Secondly, Gumilyov was not a monarchist, he doesn't care for the Tsars, and he honestly just doesn't like Taboritsky.\n\nIn his letter, Gumilyov worked around their differences, appealing to Taboritsky's desire to see Russia's borders expanded to their peak under the Empire. Some of these claims were natural: Retaking Moscow, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan, among others. Gumilyov also made some more extravagant claims, including hinting at the possible annexation of Alaska. Gumilyov felt ridiculous proposing such a thing, but Taboritsky seemed like the kind of man who would make such extravagant claims.\n\nWas all of this really worth it? Taboritsky possessed some very elite paramilitaries, but were they necessary in order to overthrow the Republic? Taboritsky was also a strong orator, with a decent support base. Including the monarchists in Gumilyov's coup could lead to a power struggle if he failed to keep them in check.

Or, Gumilyov could, despite his dislike for the man, ask Sergei Taboritsky to lend his elite stormtroopers to the Eurasian National Army, who would form the core of his new military.\n\nThe obvious problem with this plan was that the stormtroopers were, above all else, loyal to Taboritsky. They may swear allegiance to some long-dead Tsar, but Taboritsky was their de facto leader. If he relied on Taboritsky's stormtrooper too much, Taboritsky could use his influence over them in order to take power.\n\nThis choice was effectively a question of quality vs quantity. Expanding conscription would give him quantity, although they would likely take longer to be trained, and likely wouldn't be as effective as the stormtroopers. The stormtroopers may be comparatively few in number, and possibly politically dissident, but their fanaticism made them a terrifyingly effective force."

Is there really any purpose to fighting for the Revolution in a place that seems to have become numb to it?\n\nIt is only really one question, the question of all who have their lives' work torn from under them. Who next, and what then? What is, in other words, to be done?\n\nThe inaugural opening speech is as good a platform to advance the agenda as any, even if the Speaker has no real hope that this shouting match will turn out differently from the others. Even so, it is her formal duty to ensure that decorum is at least attempted, and now she must make a choice. She calls on the speakers to state their points.\n\nZhdanov, patient as ever, raises the topic of developing ideological consciousness - lukewarm, boring, but a solid opener to the day's events. Bukharina points out that ideological consciousness will not be relevant for very long unless the workers experience said ideology's benefits, and proposes instead a discussion of workplace democracy in the Republic. General-Secretary Suslov, in his usual dry manner, proposes a merger of the two topics: the centralization of workplace Unions to the Party mandate.

He's in the middle of describing the terribly convoluted process when the Party pageboy arrives.\n\nA couple of whispers and Zhdanov excuses himself with an apologetic shrug. As he cosigns the Party documents he asks if the boy's heard anything from Central - that snake Suslov has been suspiciously quiet these couple of weeks, and snakes rarely stay quiet unless they're planning on an expedient dinner. The boy only casts him a confused stare in reply. He sighs and returns the form, slipping the boy a little sugar-sweet from a well-meaning guest. (He doesn't take his tea sweet these days, more's the pity.)\n\nWhen the guests have left, Zhdanov toys with his teacup as he thinks about the guests' political potential. Perhaps they have little on their mind besides the usual concerns of the semi-involved unionists, but with a little training, who knows what they could be capable of? On that optimistic note, he opens the letter.\n\nDisbelief gives way to anger, and then to cold understanding. Zhdanov picks up the phone to call the Party headquarters, but on their end there is nothing, not even a respondent to field calls. In a huff, he marches to the door, to be met by the measured tones of Suslov himself.\n\nSuslov stares through his misted glasses, his eyes cold, his face closeted - and triumph in his voice, unmistakeable at last."

Grey-faced, grey-suited, effectively faceless - the very definition of the Party suit. And yet they speak the language of power, Suslov's only tongue, as well as he does.\n\nIt is power now that the clique gathers to speak. Talk is brief and to the point: there have been an anomalous number of intrusions on what could be said - what would surely be said, had the majority been properly guided by its betters - by people who seem less than interested in the Party Line. Indeed, these people seem altogether interested in taking Democracy out of Democratic Centralism, on usurping the Party for their own functions. And who can trust an unknown in these trying times?\n\nSuslov nods. It is time to move past the rhetoric to the only thing that matters. He proposes, in the tones of a bored schoolmaster resolving a playground dispute, a suspension to certain members of the Party, including the esteemed Bukharina and Zhdanov. A suspension that, of course, will be temporary, and is intended entirely for their own benefit and that of the Body Politic.\n\nSuslov keeps his lips tightly guarded, but he cannot suppress a twitch in his cheek.

Here and there what appeared to be the angular form of planes - rockets, perhaps? - arose from the scintillating mist around them, nestled in the ocean of red font like Venus of Botticelli.\n\nAnd at the bottom of it all a slogan: THE WORLD OF TOMORROW WITH TODAY'S SOCIALISM - FOLLOW THE ZHDANOVISM LINE.\n\nEvanoff sniffed. They'd have to do better if they wanted to impress the headmaster of the Kotlas School for Young Artists. Dipping a sponge into her bucket of water, she began to scrub the amateurish enthusiasm away. Perhaps their next work would be more inspired, or at least less excessive in its use of outlines.\n\nThe next week the propaganda was back, bolder and more garish than ever. The arsonist, whoever they were, had evidently reacted by doubling down. Bolder and crazier the red mist foamed in every corner. New symbols of progress, arrows reaching ever upwards, lifted atop a sea of crimson arms and hands holding hammers. Above them all, a rocket bearing the spindly wheels of the atom rose like Jupiter into shaded red sun-rays.\n\nThe slogan had at least been shortened. ZHDANOV TODAY - THE STARS TOMORROW!\n\nMs Evanoff stared and stared, and then she began to giggle. It was so bold, it was almost endearing. She grabbed a paintbrush and began to write a note in blue paint.

When Serov had presented his theories to him and Comrade Zhdanov, Suslov was optimistic. Though Serov was inarguably a brute, he was a loyal one, and wasn't ignorant of Marxism. Though Suslov didn't quite expect the second coming of Lenin, he hoped that the ex-NKVD chief would at least demonstrate some knowledge of socialism.\n\nInstead, he found horror. Suslov sighed and shuffled through the papers once again, the churning in his gut only intensifying. Nothing about the Manifesto was inherently wrong or reactionary, but Serov's wording, particularly in regard to what he referred to as "Hereditary Reactionaries," suggested something far more sinister than simple Theory laid under the surface of the manifesto.\n\nSuslov pushed himself away from his desk, stood quickly, hands quivering, and called for a messenger."

"This...Theory of yours." He paused.\n\nSerov saw an opportunity - perhaps if he spoke fast enough, he could explain the revelations he had come to. "I -"\n\n"You." Suslov spoke sharply, losing all pretense of neutrality. Again, Serov felt a dagger in his stomach. "These musings of yours, Comrade Serov, they suggest you are dreadfully misinformed about several things. You have been called here not for punishment - not yet -, but so we may correct this error."\n\nIf it was anyone else before him, Serov would sharply challenge the notion that he wasn't being censured - but as he gazed into the cold steel of Suslov's eyes, words seemed to fail.\n\nFor what seemed like hours, Suslov tore apart Serov's beloved Manifesto, and in the end calmly banned him from spreading it under threat of party expulsion.\n\nAnother, weaker man would take this lying down, but Serov was not a weak man. He didn't sleep that night or the next, like a weak man would.\n\nInstead he wrote, feverishly, almost maniacally. In the end, it would be worth it. Suslov would see soon just how wrong he was."

No traces of blank white paper remained on the letter he held, only the erratic ravings of a man scorned. If the Manifesto of Ordosocialism flirted with revisionism, this new monstrosity was practically wed to Reaction. He read with horror at first as Serov detailed the valuable lessons to be learned from 'the thus-far superior ideology of the German,' and how the Communist Party would do well to 'adapt the tactics of victory,' which, as far as Serov seemed concerned, referred mostly to the extermination of 'Hereditary Reactionaries', state-sponsored corporations, and a promotion of German racial theory.\n\nSuslov nearly slammed the paper onto his desk, hand quivering, not with horror, but now with rage as visions of German Tanks and Camps flashed through his mind. A snarl snaked across his lips as he pushed himself to his feet. Serov had gone too far. This was not the questions of an uneducated socialist, but the deranged lunacy of a fascist.\n\nSuslov barely noticed his surroundings as he stormed through his office and punched a number into his telephone.

Zhdanov, to his credit, had nearly immediately arrived at headquarters and agreed to sign the letter of expulsion, something Suslov took precious satisfaction with.

This is a matter of eternal life, for if these men do not die with God in their hearts, they will lack the resolve to carry on." The Priest nodded animatedly. "Naturally the Church would like all fighting-men to pray for the health of their leader as well - "\n\n[NIK.GetLeader] gestured for the Priest to take a seat. He looked around his office for a tea-sachet. Surely the man would have his tongue stilled, if nothing else. "Thank you for your attention, Father. In truth, I was thinking of adopting oaths from the ones most familiar to us. We are, as you know, a Christian nation, but not all our subjects have had the privilege of baptism. My advisors have suggested a modified version of the Soviet oath - "\n\nHe raised his hands against the already-spluttering Priest. "And yes, we are well aware the Church would not be pleased with this, to put it lightly. Which is why I was thinking of a simple Oath to the Russian State, until the spiritual health and loyalty of our subjects are ready for a full oath to God's appointed trustee. It is a compromise, and I assure you we will think of something better - but it will do for now."\n\nTime to chase the cat away. He had the affairs of men to settle. "Have a good day, Father. My receptionist will receive you.""

 NIK.370.t:0 "Embracing The Church?"
 NIK.370.d:0 "The General Staff were seldom caught by surprise - it was in the nature of their job to predict the unpredictable, to catch the curveball and throw it in the enemy's face. This aspect of their operational doctrine had been unchanged even as the politics of the State tumbled like a loose clump of dirt in a strong breeze. No one, however, had anticipated a situation quite like this.\n\nThe so-called "chaplains" in front of them - self-appointed, of course - had barred the doors of a barracks after being expelled, calling down the old Fire from Heaven in their own defense. Apparently these renegade priests had taken upon themselves the solemn duty of trying to evangelize to the infantrymen, beseeching them to convert for the health of the Nation and [NIK.GetLeader]. They had made the fatal error of approaching a company whose ranks were dominated by old Soviet veterans, and for that mistake they were set upon by the irritated and godless. It had taken the intervention of the Military Police to set them apart.\n\nA priest, lip still bleeding but head unbowed, rose to speak. "This is a travesty - that the David of Russia, the bearer of the Mantle of God, shall have the Godless as his servants and his conquerors? This is a spiritual crisis. We demand the right to administer His medicine."\n\nA general rose to speak, still trembling slightly from his age. "My men would follow the orders of our State anywhere, but to impose upon them a Church they reject is a sure path to disaster! I ask for the moderation we have always seen in you. There must be a better way to build Russia anew than to hang the Cross upon the necks of all its subjects.""

 NIK.371.d:0 "The territory once owned by the Order of Saint George has fallen under our control, and our forces have begun to restore order to the area. As with all conquests that we succeed in, different regional questions must be addressed for different areas, and Gayny is no exception. The Order, as the name implies, was highly religious, and much of their funds were poured into monasteries and churches. Over time, however, many of these houses of worship have decayed, whether from natural elements, stray bullets and shells, or German bombs- the constant among them being that most are in a state of disrepair.\n\nThe Right in Komi is predominantly religious, excluding Serov's clique, but the topic of funding to repair the churches has struck a nerve. Arguments fly back and forth between each side- those for it claim that, even ignoring the obvious religious reasons, such a move would undoubtedly win favor from the local populace. Those against it argue that such funding would be better spent on state matters, such as the military. In the end, a decision must be made- who matters more, God or the State?"

The hammer and sickle no longer waves over Archangelesk, but instead lies where it belongs- ripped and trampled, covered with mud and grime. It is the only place where such a perverse, backwards symbol should lie. Many things will come of this new development, but one of the most important is the trial of the Red Army, as it should have been a half-century ago. However, an interesting situation has cropped up- one that requires our attention.\n\nIt has always been a habit of the Bolshevik to betray their nation, and it seems that this phenomenon has cropped up yet again. Numerous Red officers, when told of what they would be tried for, seem to have had a sudden ideological change of heart. These rats in uniform seem to be more than willing to switch sides, betraying their old friends for a new job and a shot at survival.\n\nWhile it seems unlikely that these men- if they can be called such- will be any more loyal to our army than their old haunts, the Army can always use experienced officers. Letting those who repent collaborate may be a controversial move, but it would certainly be a boost for our relatively green soldiers. The choice comes down to our leadership."

However, the years of monarchist rule in the region has left its culture decidedly Tsarist- something that part of our faction has decided to use to their advantage.\n\nTaboritsky's clique has begun a push to have him nominated as the Grand Duke of Vyatka. While there's no real harm done by granting him his request- outside of some extra legitimacy for his way of viewing things- some within our faction have pushed against this move, claiming it's merely a waste of time and tying ourselves to the Tsarist days.

However, Vyatka is gone, and the territory of Berezniki is under our command. The question that has plagued multiple warlords over the years now falls to us- what do we do about the Mladorossi?\n\nOn the one hand, their beliefs- as unorthodox as they may be- do mostly fall in with at least some of the Komi Right. They could make good political partners in the region. On the other hand, some of their other beliefs directly clash with some of the closest held beliefs of our own- some even whisper that they are Bolsheviks under a coat of white paint. Though such allegations are certainly exaggerations, they must be taken into account.\n\nIn the end, this decision may not change the face of Russia forever, but it will certainly play a helping role for one faction or another, depending on what the fate of the Mladorossi is."

 NIK.375.d:0 "Viktor's truck slid to a halt at the gate of the villages, and his men leapt from the back[. In a moment, they stomped over to the gate, testing it. When they found it was locked, a short burst from a PPSH split the lock apart, and the soldiers marched in, followed by truck after truck.\n\nViktor watched as his men pulled the villagers from their homes, dragging them to the village square. Soldiers swept the dirt roads, looking for anyone foolish enough to hide or fight. If they hid, they'd catch an extra kick in the ribs before being dragged to the square. If they fought, a sharp staccato of fire would be all they received. Eventually, once Viktor was satisfied with the number of citizens gathered, he left his truck and marched in front of the local mosque, surrounded by his soldiers.\n\n"Citizens!" He began. "From this day forth, you are no longer Tatars. You are Russians! You will speak Russian, you will read Russian, and you will discard your old culture immediately or face punishment! We shall personally see to it that not a single trace of this "Tatar" culture is shown in this region again! Is that understood?"\n\nBefore the crowd had a chance to respond, Viktor waved his arm, and a hail of Molotov cocktails crashed through the mosque's windows and lit the floor on fire. As smoke began to rise behind him, Viktor smiled. His job was complete."

 NIK.376.t:0 "The Conversion Of Bashkiria"
 NIK.376.d:0 "Our efforts to secure Tatarstan have begun in earnest. The roads are filled with trucks driving from village to village, tearing down the old Tatar flags and symbols and replacing them with our flag. All seems to be well so far, but an issue has cropped up- the issue of religion.\n\nThe Tatar people are Muslims, and our soldiers are overwhelmingly not. This has led to much friction- both in the region itself and at home. Three distinct wings have broken apart on the issue. The first pushes for an immediate focus on converting the Tatars to Christianity. After all, they claimed, it is our duty as honest Christians to bring non-believers back into the fold. This would be costly and take much time to complete, but could be worth it in the end. The second wing pushes for simply crushing Islam altogether- burning mosques, prosecuting imams, and destroying the religious presence in the area as a whole. This is a controversial idea, but would be easier than conversion- though the Tatars would certainly be unhappy. Finally, some have proposed simply leaving religion untouched- the simplest, easiest option. Of course, with much of the Right being religious themselves, this is a controversial position to take. In any case, we must act, and act swiftly."

 NIK.377.d:0 "Shafarevich dropped his pen with a sigh, regarding his latest letter. It was, quite possibly, the most important letter of his political career- a make or break moment for him. Enclosed inside would be what would crack the Right in half. Shafarevich was splitting- forming his own group inside the Passionariyy.\n\nShafaverich and Gumiylov had never seen eye to eye on everything, of course, and perhaps this split was inevitable. The main force binding them together beforehand had been a mutual distrust of the Center and Left, after all. Without either of those posing a serious challenge, the cracks had widened into chasms, and it was no longer expedient- or really even tenable- to maintain the alliance. Across the Right, the pieces fall, as Passionariyy members proclaim their loyalty to one side or the other.\n\nMost importantly, however, was which way Serov and Taboritsky would fall. Though neither commanded nearly as much influence as Shafaverich or Gumiylov, their support could be the push that would make or break one side's plan. These thoughts all rushed through Shafarevich's mind as he handed the letter to his secretary- now was the hour where Russia's future would be decided."

 NIK.378.t:0 "The New Vows"
 NIK.378.d:0 "An interesting question has risen through the ranks of the Passionairyy once again- who do we swear our allegiance to? It's never been much of a problem before, when the Komi Right was just that- a political allegiance, confined only to the Komi Republic- but now that our realm is beginning to dominate Western Russia, it's becoming much more of a hot topic among the various factions that make up our power base.\n\nTaboritsky's group, as is common with them, are pushing for a decidedly monarchist vow- one that swears allegiance to the Tsar. Shafaverich, ever the populist, is pushing for the vow to be for the people. Serov himself is pushing for the oath to be to the state. FInally, Gumilyov has used his influence to try and get the oath to not be to the people, nor the state, nor the Tsar, but rather Eurasia as a whole. Each of these groups are using this moment to try and gain influence- an annoying habit of theirs, but in such a tense political environment, it's only expected. In any case, we shall swear allegiance to. . . "

Taboritsky, for his own part, held himself quite well in the face of such an intimidating figure. Both seemed to almost study the other, attempting to find what the ulterior motive of such a meeting must be. Finally, Taboritsky spoke.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke, Serov?" He questioned quietly, his gaze unmoving. Serov looked right back at him, unwavering. His voice sliced through the air like a sword- cold, swift, and deadly.\n\n"No, Sergei. This is no joke. I am entirely serious." Taboritsky cocked an eyebrow.\n\n"What do you mean? There's nothing in common between us. Ideologically, we-"\n\n"I know all about our ideological differences." Serov leaned in. "But we do have one thing in common. We're on the outside looking in. Those bastards Gumiylov and Shafarevich think that it's a two horse race. Why don't we work together, get rid of them, and then sort it out between us?"\n\nTaboritsky didn't expect the brutal honesty, but he couldn't say he disagreed. He smiled- it almost looked more like a grimace- and offered his hand for a shake. Serov looked down, and a smile slowly crept along his mouth."

 NIK.380.d:0 ""Ivan Serov. A pleasure to see you, as always." Shafarevich smiled, relaxing in his chair. Serov was nowhere near as loose, instead standing rigidly in front of the desk. "So." Shafarevich continued. "What is it you wish to see me about?"\n\n"Igor, you know as well as I do that the fate of the party is soon at hand. Gumiylov, Taboritsky, you and I are all competing for leadership. However, the prospect of a Gumiylov or Taboritsky-led Passionairyy. . .worries me. Gumilyov is a lunatic, and Taboritsky- I cannot tell if Taboritsky is high half of the time."\n\n"My god, you really are quite blunt, are you?" Shafarevich chuckled. "And what about me, Serov? I know that we disagree on many points. What makes you so receptive to me, rather than the others?"\n\n"I don't particularly like you, Igor." Serov leaned forward. "I just don't want to see my head on a pike, you understand?"\n\nShafaverich nodded. "I understand. It's a deal.""

 NIK.381.t:0 "The Re-United Passionariyy"
 NIK.381.d:0 "Shafaverich's posture, though he maintained a poker face worthy of Vegas, betrayed him. Gumilyov noticed the nervous hands clasped together, the slight slump, the tapping foot. His eyes flickered up and down before he began. "What are you doing in my office, Igor?"\n\n"Lev, I know we're not on the best of terms-" Gumiylov cocked an eyebrow. "But you're the best option we have."\n\n"I thought you split from my party for a reason, Igor." Lev stated. "Why would you come back to me now?"\n\n"Serov and Taboritsky are lunatics, Lev. They're insane. They'll drive the whole country off a cliff, and they'll kill us all while they're at it. You see that, right? We don't agree on much, but for the sake of our country, can we not come together, just this once?"\n\nLev looked him over again. Did he really need Shafarevich? He could win alone just as well as with Igor. However, the chance of Taboritsky or Serov winning, small as it may be, was simply too much of a risk to leave up to fate. Perhaps it wouldn't last too long after the conference, but it worked before. Perhaps it could work again."

 NIK.382.t:0 "The Meeting Begins"
 NIK.382.d:0 "The final struggle over Komi's future took place where so many battles had happened beforehand- the National Assembly. First came Gumiylov, surrounded by guards, he and his representatives taking their seats in the center of the Assembly. Next came Shafarevich, his men surrounding him as dutifully as Gumiylov's. They took their place to the left of the Assembly.\n\nThere was a short delay before Serov, his men clad in Soviet uniform with the stars ripped off, stepped through the doors. They took their spot in between Gumiylov and Shafaverich, and the venom began to spit between the factions- verbal tussles, insults, angry whispers. Finally, Taboritsky and his men filed in, taking their seats on the right of the Assembly floor.\n\nThe stage was set for a political explosion of biblical proportions- the only thing to do now was to give the speeches, take cover, and wait for the pieces to fall."

 NIK.383.t:0 "The Vote"
 NIK.383.d:0 "It was here. Hours of yelling, of politicians stomping their feet, of passionate speeches and angry rebuttals. A fistfight had even broken out once or twice. After a long, arduous journey, the men and women of the National Assembly rose to cast their votes on who should lead Komi into the future.\n\nGumiylov didn't show it, but his heart pounded against his ribcage as the silence grew. A truck was waiting outside in the unlikely case he lost- and he did not expect to lose. If he won, the plans to dispose of Taboritsky and Serov were clear in his mind, to be executed almost immediately- before they could escape. Shafarevich was a different story, but he would get around to him soon enough.\n\nShafaverich hid his face behind his papers to hide his growing fear. Plans swirled through his head, mixing and mashing- an escape plan here, an execution plan there. Whichever one he would need to implement, he was certainly ready.\n\nSerov's ice cold face didn't betray a hint of nervousness. His mind had filed with plans- plans to leave, plans to stay. He would win, or he would leave, and he suspected the rest of the room felt the same way, as much as they tried to hide their emotions.\n\nTaboritsky drummed his fingers against the table. Could he do it? Could he win? If not, what then? He hadn't thought that part of this all the way through- his half-formed plan ending at leaving the city in a car as quickly as possible. Whatever he did after this vote, he knew it would decide his fate.\n\nAs the votes were counted, the tension increased. As it was about to burst, a man stepped up to the podium and began to read."

 NIK.384.t:0 "Taboritsky Triumphant!"
 NIK.384.d:0 "A stunned silence enveloped the National Assembly as the final result was read. Gumilyov rose from his seat, shocked. Shafaverich's eyes widened in astonishment. Serov's face broke for a moment, showing his absolutely confounded expression. For a moment, there was silence in the room.\n\nAnd then everything began to move.\n\nMen exploded from their seats, shouting unintelligibly about a rigged vote. Some began shaking down those around them, searching for the traitors to the party, to their leader, to the nation. Others made a beeline for the door- their hand was played and lost, and the only thing they could do was leave. Still others rushed towards Taboritsky's joyous men, stopped only by a line of policemen and guards separating the groups from each other. The noise echoed off the walls, only escalating into a cacophony of chaos.\n\nIn the middle of it all, Taboritsky's smile spread across his face. He had always known he was in the right. He knew he would win, no matter what the others thought. Once again, he was correct. Now, the rest of the Right would see what Sergey Taboritsky really was."
 NIK.384.a:0 "It can't be true!"

 NIK.385.t:0 "Serov Triumphant!"
 NIK.385.d:0 "Serov did not smile often. He prided himself on his calm, cold exterior. After all, "Friendly" and "NKVD officer" were not mixable traits. The last time he could remember himself smiling- genuinely smiling, not just the crocodile smile he gave to those he needed for his plans- was at his desk long ago, writing out his masterpiece. He could remember the ecstasy of the final tap of the typewriter, and he could remember the crushing blow of Suslov, rather than even taking a moment to truly think about his writings, casting it aside out of hand. If only old Mikhail could see him now!\n\nHe had worked hard in the last years. Going from the Left to the Right was nearly unheard of, and it took much time for them to trust him as one of their own. He was no fascist, not at all. At heart, he was still a socialist- just not one of those doddering fools or naive idealists who seemed to think that slapping the same red coat of paint on Russia would be enough to win. He knew better. Maybe Russia hadn't wanted to accept it then, but they were going to accept it now. He would make them.\n\nAnd so, as chaos swept the floor of the National Assembly, and men leapt from their seats in astonishment at what was thought to be impossible, Serov allowed himself a genuine smile."
 NIK.385.a:0 "How'd he pull it off?"

 NIK.386.t:0 "Shafarevich Triumphant!"
 NIK.386.d:0 "The Assembly had expected two outcomes to the meeting. The expected outcome was that Gumiylov would enter as head of state and emerge as head of state. After all, was he not the driving force of the Right? The underdog story was Igor Shafaverich- the compassionate conservative, as he styled himself. Shafarevich had been the young face of the Passionariyy, and had been expected to have a long career in front of him.\n\nOf course, events changed all that, and suddenly Shafaverich found himself not as second in command to one faction among many, but second in the leaders of Komi. This was not a position he particularly wanted, and his split from Gumiylov's wing drew much attention. Most analysts agreed, however- Shafarevich had made his move too early. His bid for power would come up short, and then he'd surely be in for it.\n\nWhen the vote count was finished, and Shafaverich was named the new head of state, the National Assembly fluttered with confusion and mild surprise. It was nowhere near the shock of what would have happened from a Serov or Taboritsky victory, but it was enough to surprise many. As the men and women of the Assembly filed out, Shafarevich took a moment to savor his victory. Soon, he could really get to work."

So when it actually happened, the most chaotic the Assembly got was a small murmur of affirmation and clapping from his own wing. What was much more interesting was the events immediately afterwards.\n\nSerov and Taboritsky both rose from their chairs and made their exits- Taboritsky nearly dashing to the exit, while Serov at least had the brains to keep his mask of calm up as he left. No doubt, Gumiylov thought as he watched them go, they were going to try and cause trouble. He sighed- just another thing to hang them for. His eyes flicked to Shafaverich, who had not left. What was he to do with him? It would take longer to get rid of a man as popular as Igor, but it would be done, eventually. Soon enough, Gumiylov would be alone at the top, and the Eurasianist dream could finally be realized.\n\nAs truck engines outside roared into the distance, Gumiylov's joyous demeanor finally returned, and his heart stopped beating so hard. He would never admit it to anyone, but he was a little worried there."
 NIK.387.a:0 "As expected."

 NIK.388.t:0 "The Anti-Establishment Coalition Triumphant!"
 NIK.388.d:0 ""What?"\n\nThere was a single word spoken when the results came in, and all eyes turned to it. Gumiylov had fled from his seat, and Shafaverich had done the same. Both men were the only two standing, facing down the Assembly, to the center. The rest of the Assembly was stunned into silence- not even able to voice their shock and disbelief.\n\n"Is this some sort of joke?" Gumiylov asked, the color draining from his face. The man at the center shook his head. Shafeverich and Gumilyov shared a look- terror, perhaps, or disbelief- and turned back to the man. It couldn't be true.\n\nAnd then, they began to leave.\n\nIt started as a trickle of shell-shocked representatives before the dam broke, a cacophony of footsteps desperate to get out of the way of the hell that was soon to come. Serov and Taboritsky watched the fleeing masses before their eyes locked onto each other. Gumiylov and Shafaverich were gone, thrown into the trashcan of history- the question now was whether Taboritsky or Serov would follow them. The little goodwill built between the two would soon fall to pieces, and then the final battle over Komi's future would begin."

Then they reach out to each other and shake hands. The Convergence is over, and the Impossible Duo has, against all odds, beaten back their opposition amongst the Rightists of Komi.\n\nThe effect is instantaneous: Gumilyov, upon hearing of his defeat, has the cheer crumble off his face, along with his confidence. His hands trembling, he points to the Coalition and snaps, "It was - it was the Romano-Germanics that did this! They have usurped the will of the People, putting impostors in my - our place!" As his own followers stare at this sudden lurch into idiocy, the spell is broken. Gumilyov finds himself the centre of a gradually widening circle, and as he is dragged out of the hall for disorderly conduct no one follows him, or bats an eye.\n\nTaboritsky, conversely, chuckles. He bows his head and he begins to laugh, in uproarious bursts that heave the breath from him, and when he is finished he wipes the tears from his eyes. His eyes shining, he points towards the ceiling in rapturous wonder and proclaims only this:\n\n"I have been wrong. All this time. Perhaps the King I seek shall not be found through me - perhaps I am not a worthy vessel. But as for YOU!" He points to the increasingly confused duo. "Promise me you will follow the will of the Skein. Promise me!" He falls silent, and his own entourage applaud politely, while the rest of the Passionaryy stare in mute horror.\n\nSerov glances at Shafarevich, and there is no warmth shared in the glance, only the cold taste of victory and the colder calculus running through the minds of both.

The rise of Taboritsky and Serov to become real contenders for the Convergence had left him thoroughly rattled, and he felt more anxious than he'd ever expected to. He drew some calm from his ally, however, and kept his composure. A few minutes later, it was finally time to announce the results of the vote.\n\n"The winners of the vote and leaders of the Passionaryy are Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich." The Assembly erupted into cheers, their supporters expressing the relief also washing over him. As Igor got out of his seat, he was pulled into a big hug by Gumilyov, the force of which betrayed that his ally, too, had carried doubts of their success. It didn't matter anymore. Their gambit had worked. They had won. They had secured the future of their movement, and they had shut out the NKVD thug and the delusional tsarist. As he knew deep down that they would. This was their movement after all.\n\nThe defeated candidates wasted little time in rallying their supporters and leaving the assembly. They would have to be dealt with, of course.

While it's hard to predict which of the two men will emerge victorious, the consequences of victory are easy to foresee.

Many assumed it would break inevitably - and that to bet on Ivan Serov would be the obvious choice. With his military connections, it seemed obvious that the final struggle between the two would be somewhat slanted towards him, and the confrontation was indeed brief.\n\nIn the early hours of the morning, several reported awakening to the sound of gunshots, and multiple military and paramilitary forces "occupying" several locations ranging from homes to pivotal roads, with several of Taboritsky's deputies being awoken and dragged out at gunpoint. As for Taboritsky himself, rumors abound to his exact location, though most agree that he is no longer in Komi.\n\nSerov is now the undisputed master of the Republic - though with his former allies gone, one can question how much his power base has been afflicted by their removal. Solidifying his grip over Komi is doubtless the first thing on his agenda, and while his supporters cheer... others fear for their lives."

Fewer are surprised that the resulting power struggle has proven to be brutal.\n\nWhile vicious, at least it's also proving to be brief, as a decisive blow seems to have been struck in the small hours this morning when paramilitaries loyal to Taboritsky were observed taking action in several locations across the republic. Masked men were seen breaking into the residences of Serov's closest supporters and taking them away to an unknown location. The action has proven a decisive one, as most of Serov's inner circle seems to have been seized successfully, the rest having gone into hiding and Serov himself also missing. There are multiple rumours surrounding his whereabouts spreading, but a growing number of reports agree he's fled Ust-Sysolsk.\n\nThere can be little doubt that Taboritsky is now the master of the state. With his erstwhile allies gone, however, their fates unknown except to their captors, his base of support appears precariously diminished. Whether he can keep the power he's secured remains to be seen."

However, the fact remains that he was once a member of the Left in the past. Perhaps it is this that comforts him, or guides him to the choice that he takes.\n\nDinner parties. Small private meetings. All with similar guests, and all with similar phrases. "I will protect the proletariat." "I will restore socialism." "I will keep the traditions of the past alive." Despite the similar gatherings and similar guests however, the responses are different. To some of his pleas he gains nods of acquiescence, while others reply with questions, or cold defiance.\n\nAnd yet, he continues. Why? Perhaps he's genuine. Perhaps he never left the party at all, and perhaps Suslov got him wrong. Perhaps he's looking for men he can get brief support from, and then depose of them when he no longer needs them. Or - perhaps he's simply opportunistic, willing to bend whatever way will get him power. No one knows but Serov.\n\nWhat is known to all however, is that this is a risky gamble."

He didn't like making full use of his money and connections publicly, but for this rare occasion he thought the display of wealth and opulence was worth a little exposure. The Imperial decorations and luxurious refreshments would reinforce his message of Imperial Greatness. He gave the invited guests ample time to enjoy both and waited until a little over two hours into the party before judging that the time had come, and taking the stage.\n\n"My dear friends, fellow Russians. We have taken an important step towards unifying our great tsardom. It is, however, but the first step of many. Since the loss of the Holy Tsar, Russia has fallen far. Our motherland lies broken and shattered - her people divided, fearful, and in need. That unrighteous betrayal, and our failure to prevent it, set us on this path to destruction, and now, the only path back is through righteousness. A righteous Tsar to lead a righteous people. A righteous people to march away from the humiliations of today and yesterday, away from the spectres of fear, want, and division, towards a future where the greatness of Russia is restored."\n\n"That Tsar lives! Alexei II survived the Bolshevik terror and waits, in hiding, for his throne to be restored. Only then will it be safe for him to return. Only then will righteousness rule the land once more. Until that time, strong leadership is needed to prepare Russia for his arrival. As Regent, I will provide that leadership. I will lead us on the path of righteousness and I welcome all of you to walk it with me. Together, we will restore Russia to greatness! Together, we will destroy the Bolsheviks, traitors and parasites that let her fall to ruin and who will surely now oppose us!"\n\nAnd with that, he led a toast. First to the assembled guests, then to Russia and finally to the Holy Tsar, and punctuated the toast and his speech by forcefully hurling his glass to the floor.

Ambition was something all of his guests had, but the former leftist had history they did not.\n\nFinally, the final guest slithered in silently, his eyes slits and his smile unnervingly fixed.

The breadth of thought in our alliance means there are many competing ideas for how to address this. There is a general agreement that the government needs to be in control of several important sectors in the economy, but beyond that, there is little common ground to be found.\n\nA large faction contend that we must allow market forces to operate in non-strategic spheres of the economy. They say private enterprises will complement their state-run counterparts to provide greater welfare for all. The best way to achieve both would be to provision for private property rights in our constitution while also specifying that it can be overruled and under what conditions.\n\nThere are many, however, who believe we can only realize our plans under a total command economy. Everything in the republic belongs to the whole nation, and it is only right that the nation be empowered to mobilize every farmer, worker and clerk to achieve its aims. Private businesses will always, by their very nature, undermine this aim. The constitution should, according to this faction, define all property as belonging to the state.\n\nTaboritsky's faction advocates a third approach. They say that it is these modern economic theories and structures that got Russia to this sorry state. We must cast away these foreign theories and look back to the heyday of Russia. The traditional way of life is what will restore Russia to greatness, and that starts with the economy. The constitution must empower the state to take any measures necessary to return Russians to where they belong."

Shafarevich, instead, proposes a lighter alternative: Federalism, leaving some power in the hands of regional administrations while the central government still rules strongly. Lastly, Gumilyov fights strongly for self determination among the regions, instead forming a sort of confederacy. Tensions increase, but ultimately one side wins the day:"

Each of the men sat in their own homes, dwelling on thoughts of the past and the future as they shamelessly tried to throw themselves into projects to distract from or alleviate these.\n\nShafarevich knew he had to both make some sacrifices and some compromises to get where he was, at the cusp of power. Yet, as he set the bottle down, he couldn't help but worry. He felt what he was doing was for the good of Russia, he swore to himself, and yet he felt himself drifting further from his principles as he climbed into the echelons of the party. But damn was it a long climb.\n\nGumilyov, as he always did, was polishing one of his rough theories, scribbling on an old sheet of paper at his desk. The time was coming when these would be fact, and he had worked hard to near that occasion. He didn't have the same way with words as his father, the poor bastard, but he was having an easy enough time getting an idea out. Shame they wouldn't stay on the page, as he scratched out each halfway decent sentence he wrote. Determination and, for lack of a better term, passion had brought him to this point, but as evidenced by his writer's block: would it bring him any further than this?\n\nTaboritsky, meanwhile, was on a roll. While passion had brought Gumilyov to the top and Shafarevich had planned his way there, Taboritsky rose in a frenzy. That was his constant state. He had to be planning, moving, seething. Thus, while the rest of those in household were asleep, he was tearing through maps ranging from 1600 all the way to 1962. Most of them were wrong, but he continued to look through them one after the other over and over in search of the true Monarch of Russia. That was his goal, after all. To rebuild. To grow.

He stops for a while in whatever passes for stupefaction in the youth, makes a face and walks away. The Deputy calls after him, "Have a good day! The Government is here for you if you need anything!"\n\nThe next few villagers arrive all at once, in a station-wagon almost falling apart with rust and disuse. The Deputy calls out to them too, shouting, "Have a good day! The Government of Komi works only for you!" Muted laughter resounds from the car's cabin and a face reaches out from what must once have been a window. "Have a good day, Deputy! Must be a lonely day in the office, yes?"\n\nThe Deputy, beaming, turns to reply, but the station-wagon's low growl cuts him off before he can say anything. He looks into the massive cloud of smoke, still smiling, and carries on. So it continues through the morning, the sweeping of stray leaves and the urban garbage of Komi's 57th District into giant piles - and the disposal of these piles into burlap sacks. People stare curiously - once or twice visitors ask for signatures, something which the Deputy is only too happy to provide. Always he reminds the people he meets to vote and keep the Government accountable - something which they can also fulfill by writing to himself.\n\nAs noon towers over Komi the Deputy stumbles into his office, nearly tripping over the carpet. The smile disappears from his face. Glowering, he begins to laboriously type a transcript of his day's endeavors - starting with the number of people he has greeted, and the number of We Believe In The Komi Republic! badges he has given out.\n\nNearly breaking the typewriter with his hammy fingers, he writes:"

Dissidents, once arrested and put through due process, began to simply disappear. The faces of Taboritsky's soldiers hardened, taking on a cruel aspect. Instructions to the citizenry became increasingly terse and cold. People whispered fearful wisdom to one another, spreading tales of arbitrary punishments delivered without mercy or hesitation. Change came gradually, but the day on which a protest was met with phosgene gas and the deadly rattle of machine-guns was the final turning of the key.\n\nThe clock chimed a hollow note, hailing the dawn of a new day.

Receiving orders from the puppet master of the Left, hundreds of fully equipped and well-trained troops converged on the capital of our Republic, heading for government buildings and the National Assembly itself. They met almost no resistance. Many were arrested, from prominent political opponents to right-wing sympathizers or even normal civilians. In the end, the troops all reached their final destination: the legislative building of the Republic.\n\nAt gunpoint, all members of parliament bar the most loyal Suslovites were swiftly arrested by the military, and the government body, effectively under the control of the putschists, was forced to obey their orders. The Constitution of the Komi Republic has been declared no longer effective, and a new constitution has been hastily drafted, marking the official creation of the Komi Socialist Republic. As for its leader, it is not the puppet master, Suslov himself. Instead, Boris Ponomaryov, well-known as his most trusted ally, has been appointed General Secretary. Suslov himself is merely the Premier of the Republic, preferring to control the new regime from behind the scenes.\n\nWhether the socialist experiment will succeed in Komi remains to be seen, but first, the Suslovite clique that has now seized control will need to properly assert it over the country. Resistance from the center and right will be at a disadvantage, as they now have to become insurgents against the authoritarian government. The next few days will be crucial for the Komi state."

It's a common ailment for the smoke-lovers of the Republic: cigarette breaks last far longer than they should, partially because of the sheer difficulty of procuring sticks from the chaotic supply routes traceable to India and China. Every cigarette break is a luxury - to be savoured, not expended.\n\nEven so, a cigarette break is physically incapable of lasting for a full hour, and at 2:30 pm a search party is sent out to reprimand the Representative and get his voting record on the present Bill. Decorum is decorum, after all.\n\nIt is quite a surprise when the search party instead discovers armed men outside the doors of the Congress - as a furious scuffle begins between the reluctant gunmen and the furious Representatives, shots are fired into the air. Guards rush to the defense of the beleaguered politicians from within the chamber, and the session becomes an armed standoff between two very irate groups of ageing men and women.\n\nIt is comical, for about five minutes: then the armored column arrives. Red-stars splayed on their sides and banners waving from the hatches leave no doubt as to who masterminded this little action. From the first tank Zhdanov and Suslov clutch little ushankas. Zhdanov is yelling like a cowboy to the other tanks, almost exuberant, while Suslov is unnervingly silent. Crowds gather round the column, yelling slogans and waving banners of their own.\n\nAs the column aims their considerable armaments on the Parliament, options narrow and vanish. Army units refuse to assemble, or simply dissolve like snow at a fingernail touch.

Either way, no one is surprised when military barricades set up to 'calm the workers and point them back home' simply join the demonstrations, riding the popular tide. Personnel carriers left abandoned by their sides are commandeered as vanguards, their sides festooned with red flags as they move into the Capital.\n\nThe final attempt to rebuff the wave of popular dissent comes in front of the Legislature itself, which is currently in session. The armed escort of guards suddenly seems small next to the crowds that have swelled into the streets, their presence almost minimal. As the workers demand an entry into Congress to air their views on several pressing workers' rights issues, a gunshot is fired from an unknown source.\n\nHistory's wheels are spurred into action.\n\nThe rush into the building is quick, even if it is violent at times: workers drag assemblymen out of their seats, some still struggling with their captors, and atop the podium Svetlana Bukharina is proclaimed new Premier of the Komi Soviet Socialist Republic.

 komicoup.8.d:0 "The rising shocked the current government, beginning with attacks on police officers and loyal civilians. In Syktyvkar, reports of violence streamed to the city hall all too quickly as gunshots and screams became louder, drawing close. Loyalists met the paramilitaries in the streets and alleys. But they were ambushed, trapped by a hail of fire from the windows above and from the cellars below. And as they battled, so were civilians caught in the crossfire.\n\nConfusion increased as units were lost in the depths of the city. Others were directed to the wrong places by their superiors. The battles became too intense and men began to desert. But the Passionariyy pursued them, even to the river, where men attempted to surrender but instead paid for their loyalty with their lives. Bodies floated down the water as pleas rang throughout.\n\nBridges were taken. Important roads were blocked, secured by patrols. The ways leading out of the city were sealed as were those getting in. Attempts were made to break out for reinforcements or for escape, but they were crushed.\n\nSoon enough, it was all over. They swarmed the hall, intimidating the legislature as they were opening today's session with guns and clubs. They arrested those they had on their lists, adding to them anyone who resisted or was thought to have resisted. Shots were common, and the bodies streamed out as did those who lived to be sent away.\n\nWith the old government dissolved, they made haste to see their constitution instituted. Then, it was declared, their triumph made law as a cheerful Gumilyov was sworn in as the leader of this new government. With the legitimization of their overthrow, the Passionariyy were now in control of what once was the Republic."

 komicoup.10.d:0 "Finally, we have done it. Komi's democracy has always struggled, and the last few weeks have been its darkest hour yet. After countless cycles of coups, and after such tremendous civil unrest, the Republic has triumphed. The Republic has risen from the ashes and flames dropped by the Luftwaffe, and it has survived the many knives pointed at its back by its very own people. The rightists and leftists no longer can pose a threat against us, and we did not have to abandon our ideals to do so. The people have made their voices heard, and have embraced democracy as their future. For once, our government may rest, no longer dancing upon a knife's edge. It almost feels like a dream.\n\nHowever, our rest is only temporary, and many external threats wish to see our Republic destroyed once and for all. Western Russia is not kind to democracy's ideals, and we have made our fair share of enemies during our short history. We shall prove them wrong. With the Republic finally secured, we may now prepare to rebuild our forces, rebuild our industry, and prepare to go to war. We shall not go softly into the night, we shall bring democracy's light to all of Western Russia. We have learned from our past mistakes, and we shall take the offensive against those who seek to harm our Republic."

 komicoup.11.d:0 "Finally, we have done it. Ever since Lenin first led our people into revolution, socialism has been the true destiny of Russia. However, this world has not been kind to the revolution, and much of the Motherland has abandoned Marx's teachings. However, with the success of our coup, we have taken the first step towards reigniting communism's torch. Through the countless cycles of coups and civil unrest, the revolution has finally been secured, and the Party is now the sole authority left in Syktyvkar. We may breathe easy, knowing that we no longer need to fear the revolution's destruction at the hands of Komi's liberals and rightists.\n\nHowever, the revolution still has many enemies left to face. Western Russia may be home to our ideological allies in Archangelsk, but many of our neighbours seek to destroy the revolution once and for all. Tsarists, fascist collaborators, and whatever abomination the Aryan Brotherhood have become, they all wish to see us and our cause dead. We must rebuild. We must equip the people of Komi, and we must go to war. If the rest of Russia will not embrace the revolution, it must be spread by force. The reactionaries cling to a doomed cause, and we shall prove this to them through the strengths of our bonds, and the strength of our arms."

 komicoup.12.t:0 "Our Regime Secured"
 komicoup.12.d:0 "Finally, we have done it. Through the countless coups, counter-coups, and civil unrest, we have emerged victorious. The leftists, liberals, and cosmopolitan influences within Ust-Sysolsk have been destroyed, and now only our cause remains. The failing Komi Republic has once and for all been put out of its misery, along with much of its leadership. The communists have been rounded up and purged, as revenge for what their twisted ideology has put our nation through. With no opposition to oppose us, we no longer have to fear the overthrow of our regime. We have much work left to do.\n\nWith communists to our north, an expansionist tsarist pretender to our south, and... whatever is going on in Perm, our regime still has plenty of external threats to deal with. We must prepare our people for war. This means rebuilding industry, equipping our armies, reorganizing our depleted military, and ensuring that our soldiers are willing to die for our cause. Once we are prepared, we shall wage war against all who seek to threaten us. In the end, Western Russia will surely be ours. The Motherland has long been shackled by the weak, and we shall finally set her free."
 komicoup.12.a:0 "Our enemies shall tremble against our might!"

 komicoup.13.t:0 "Stability at Last"
 komicoup.13.d:0 "It has been done, stability has finally been brought to Komi. Under Stalina's leadership, the Government for National Reconstruction has finally secured the Republic against the constant threat of extremism. Stability came at a heavy price, however. So many coups, counter-coups, and such tremendous civil unrest. Our people have suffered, but we shall heal them. While the Constitution may be suspended, the Republic survives, and the leftists and rightists who wished to see it fall have fallen themselves. Stalina has long known the bite of radicalism, and while she has defeated its presence in Komi, her crusade is not over yet.\n\nRadicalism has consumed much of Mother Russia. So much hate, so much suffering, so much destruction. Radicals surround the Republic, and will inevitably seek to destroy it, as radicalism knows only how to destroy. The Republic shall not fall, however. The people of Komi shall arm themselves, they shall rebuild, and they shall prepare to liberate the Motherland from the clutches of extremism. First, all of Western Russia must be liberated, the communists, collaborators, and Nazis have oppressed this land for too long. Then, the Republic shall reclaim Siberia. Then, the Republic shall look to the west, and allow all of Russia to know the sweet taste of freedom. Then, and only then, will Stalina's crusade be complete."

It was a gunboat, the first that the docks of Syktyvkar had purpose-built. Mounted machine-guns ringed her hull, and a single 85mm cannon graced her front deck, taking up the majority of the available space. To the assembled military men, she was beautiful. A beautiful solution to the ugly problem of piracy and smuggling.\n\n"Give the dockworkers my congratulations," began Korolkov, surveying the radio antenna on her stout command center.\n\nLigachev nodded.

Yet another late night at the office. The light patter of rain against the window drew his eyes to the dark, muggy streets of Syktyvkar outside. He rose to his feet and brought the cigarette to his lips as he surveyed the city. It was quiet tonight; too quiet for his tastes.\n\nSometimes, young members of the communist party, whispering in each other's ears without a care in the world, would comment on Mikhail Suslov's secrecy - his paranoia. The Party was a safe place, they'd whine. They were all comrades there, right? Perhaps he could just loosen up a little.\n\nUsually they'd shut up when Yuri tapped them on the shoulder and asked them if they wanted to share their opinions with the class. Then they'd know who the real shadow of the Party was.\n\nAndropov snickered at the memory and shook his head. His job wasn't all just scaring dumb kids - it was to do what needed to be done to ensure Party stability - or to disappear whoever had earned Suslov's ire. The latest list of names to investigate Mikhail had given him was, all things considered, damn boring for the most part; one name, however, caught his attention. Svetlana Bukharina.\n\nHe had met the kid a few times, he remembered, blowing some smoke out onto the window. She spoke like Yuri imagined a princess would, all prim and proper, smiled as she shook his hand, the works. It's how he knew she was dangerous. Her father was like that too. A wonderful man, if you were on his good side - but there was a venom hidden behind his eyes, and he saw that behind hers too.\n\nAs Yuri watched, a bolt of lightning lit up the city. For a moment, it almost seemed like it was on fire. He wondered then if it was a sign of what Svetlana could do.\n\nHe shook his head and tossed the cigarette into the ashtray."

The knife in his boot, and the tokarev in his pocket - you never knew who would be out to silence you in this town.\n\nThings were moving faster these days than they had in years - Lenin was certainly right about that. Sometimes decades happened in the span of weeks. The kid was a goddamned savant at the political game - Bukharina, he corrected himself. In just a few short weeks she'd rapidly moved up in the party and had cemented herself as a force to be reckoned with.\n\nSomething told Yuri she wouldn't stop rising there. She was like a goddamned force of nature in the party, one that Suslov was growing increasingly worried about - and therein lied Yuri's choice.\n\nGiving her a good word to the General Secretary would keep her safe for a while longer - and Yuri had a feeling she'd capitalize on that. Good investment.\n\nOn the other hand, a part of him said to wait and see. If his feeling about her was right, she'd be able to claw her way to Suslov herself."

It had been a very productive meeting with several prominent 'revisionists', as Suslov would have called them. Yuri would have called them smart people. He wasn't exactly a bleeding heart when it came to how to best implement Socialism, but he was a smart man.\n\nThese people were, whether he personally liked it or not, the future. Bukharina - hell, even Zhdanov, to some extent - they were the ones who were going to lead the Party to the future, not Suslov. Though they may have initially distrusted him as a hardliner, they certainly didn't after tonight.\n\nAndropov chuckled to himself.

 komilaws.1.d:0 "The Komi Republic, unlike many of the warlord states that have spread across the old Soviet Union, is blessed with a formal governmental and economic system. However, this does not entail stability or any sort of expedience in the National Assembly's budgetary machinations.\n\nThe so-called Voznesentsi, the ruling party in the governing coalition of the Republic, have prepared a budget for the year, a comprehensive initiative focused on external defense, internal policing, and public welfare to repair the damages caused by the bombings. However, internal polling reveals a rather concerning trend within the coalition - with our current number of 'confirmed' votes it seems that if any more dissensions at all are to take place within the governing coalition, the budget will fail, and the Republic's government will be paralyzed for months.\n\nIn the wake of the discovery of this distressing trend within the party, the President of the Republic has been forced to make a decision. The budget could be handed to Alexei Kosygin, leader of the "Young Reformists" Party and talented economist, or it could be kept as-is, and strings pulled to ensure that the vote goes our way. While Kosygin is slightly to the right of the President, his influence could ensure that the budget passes safely and comfortably, evading an embarassing government failure or shutdown."

To pass the bill, there are two proposed strategies. Either roll back some of the proposals to get Kosygin's party back on board, or try to get Zhdanov's faction of the KKP to vote with the government by promising the military contracts will be awarded to council-run industries associated with his support base.

More worryingly, multiple members of the Assembly from our coalition parties have stated they will vote with the Passionaryy against the budget should it fail to reassure them it is not the result of a backroom deal with the communists.

The right wingers are now confident they defeated communist collusion with the DSNP, not realizing the actual backroom deal regarded which factories get the production contracts. A few choice cuts to non-essential services like library funding and housing acquisition brought them on board with the new budget.

Alexei Kosygin of the Union of Young Reformers was highly critical of the bill for its cuts to internal spending, particularly on social security, and almost two thirds of the party's representatives refused to vote for it. That is when the Communist Party unexpectedly came to the President's rescue, the majority of their representatives voting for the new budget on grounds of its importance in protecting national industry and securing the Revolution.n/n/The budget thus passed with a comfortable majority, and President Voznesensky is expected to hold a press conference tonight thanking his allies and those opponents who supported the bill. All may however not be a bed of roses for the President in the future, as Lev Gumilyov and Igor Shafarevich have issued a joint press statement that they will conduct a thorough internal investigation both of the members of Shafarevich' circle who backed the bill without checking it for communist infiltration, and of the government's own potential collaboration with the KKP.

 komilaws.7.d:0 "Cause to celebrate for President Kosygin today, as his Union of Young Reformers have handily passed a revised national budget, increasing internal spending while also giving concessions to the DSNP and PSD on matters of expansion of national security infrastructure. The Passionaryy and Communist Party have both decried the bill for its raising of taxes and bypassing of industrial self-regulation principles. Lacking the necessary majority to challenge the bill, the opposition could do little but protest as it passed through the Assembly with great aplomb. President Kosygin is expected to hold a press conference tonight thanking his allies and those doubtful of his faction who still supported the bill. Here at the Komi Courier we can only hope the revised budget genuinely helps carry our nation forward into the future."

 komilaws.11.t:0 "Stalina's Budget"
 komilaws.11.d:0 "Supporters of the Sovereign Democratic Party are celebrating across the Republic today as President Stalina's budget handily passed through the National Assembly. Chants of "Steel does not bend!" could be heard across public squares in Syktyvkar after it was announced the leadership of the DSNP and SMR were withdrawing their challenges to President Stalina's new national budget reform and fully backing it. While the bill was initially heavily criticized by the coalition partners for focusing heavily on national security and internal stability issues, the President has clearly made her partners come round to her way of thinking. With the hopes of the opposition to kill the bills dashed, it is expected the President will soon roundly congratulate her allies and decry the weakness of the opposition. We here at the Komi Courier only hope the budget will deliver on the promised national security improvements."

 komilaws.12.d:0 "The government's national budget proposal passed through the National Assembly today, but many members of the cabinet are disappointed and see it as a defeat. To get the required majority, President Voznesensky had to roll back a number of his proposed budget changes, especially in regards to cuts to internal spending to balance out the increase in military spending. This has forced the government to consider raising taxes, an unpopular move indeed. At least the President can be relieved the Republic will remain functional another year. Here at the Komi Courier, we have to say that is often all one can hope for."
 komilaws.12.a:0 "It had to be done to keep the system stable."

 komilaws.13.t:0 "The Infrastructure Repair Bill"
 komilaws.13.d:0 "As part of our new set of reforms, an increased amount of funding will go towards restoring the functionality of infrastructure damaged by German bombing, particularly paved roads, railroads, and larger bridges. The problem is that if we follow the recommendation of the democratic coalition partners and commit to this without compensating for the very likely possibility of going over our very limited budget, we risk running up debt, which is notoriously expensive due to our isolation from international credit. Yegor Ligachev of the DSNP believes he has found a solution after receiving assurances from Zhdanov that the KKP will vote in support of any increase in income taxes necessary to fund the Infrastructure Repair Bill. This will however be highly unpopular both with the people and with the democratic centre. The Passionaries on the other hand want to ensure the repairs are done within budget by utilizing our thousands of prison inmates as unpaid workers. This suggestion would be most popular with the people, but the rest of the governing parties would see it as highly inhumane. Which proposal should we go with?"
 komilaws.13.a:0 "Pass the tax hikes, with Zhdanov's support."
 komilaws.13.b:0 "Unite the center - expand the budget!"

 komilaws.14.t:0 "The Mandated Minority Representation Bill"
 komilaws.14.d:0 "It is a sad fact of life that in a republic centered on the Komi region that the actual Komi people and the other Fenno-Uralic minorities in the Republic are woefully underrepresented in the regional government and National Assembly. As such, the Communist Party has introduced a bill enshrining the right of the natives to have a number of Assembly seats proportional to their population in the Republic, as well as a guaranteed right to jobs in the government of majority native municipalities. Needless to say, passing this bill would strengthen the Communists considerably, as they are already doing well among the natives and this bill would enshrine them as the party of native rights. As such, the Passionaries want the bill voted down, on the grounds of mandatory native representation being undemocratic in a system preaching one man, one vote. Of course, in reality their chief concern is the threat a strengthened Communist Party could present. As a compromise, the native Komi SMR representative Ivan Morozov has drafted a bill that would guarantee the natives access to local government and a heavier vote weight in Assembly elections, but no mandatory lower limit on native representation. The Center have rallied around this proposal, though many in the SMR and DSNP are clearly more sympathetic to the Communist's Mandated Minority Representation Bill. What will the Assembly conclude?"
 komilaws.14.a:0 "Pass it in full, an excellent idea!"
 komilaws.14.b:0 "We can learn some lessions, here."
 komilaws.14.c:0 "This is patently discriminatory against Russians."

 komilaws.15.t:0 "The Defense Of The Republic Bill"
 komilaws.15.d:0 "The Republic has mandated conscription to defend itself, but the opposition is highly critical of the two-year draft system favored by the DSNP and PSD. The current system has held for years, as the SMR, despite being critical of conscription, accepts it as a matter of national security. Now, however, in an unusual act of cooperation, the Communists have endorsed a bill first introduced by the Passionaryy suggesting an alternative four year conscription system, albeit with a provision for lowered recruiting standards to ensure a bulkier army. With this alliance, and the risk of more conservative PSD members defecting to vote with the Passionaryy, there's a very real chance the two-year model is under threat. The Assembly will need to pass a decision on the Defense of the Republic Bill."
 komilaws.15.a:0 "The bill passes, including the KKP provision."
 komilaws.15.b:0 "The bill passes, but the KKP provision fails."
 komilaws.15.c:0 "The Center holds, the PSD whips kill the bill in committee."

 komilaws.16.t:0 "The Comprehensive Zoning Reform Bill"
 komilaws.16.d:0 "We have gained a stable enough majority in the National Assembly that we can... redraft... parliamentary districts in an... equitable... fashion. Yes, that sounds good, a very generous description of the Equal Zoning Bill.\n\nOn paper, the bill will ensure "fairer" representation by redrafting districts to be of equivalent geographical area rather than based on population alone, ensuring a better representation for the countryside, which generally leans centrist, over the population centers like Syktyvkar. Now, of course, it is very possible that some districts may be more equal than others, and should we desire to instead benefit one of the opposition factions for the purposes of our plans, it can easily be done by adding a provision allowing for smaller districts either in city centers, benefitting the KKP, or the suburban regions and smaller towns, benefitting the Passionaryy. How should we draft the bill?"
 komilaws.16.a:0 "Well, if it could keep us safe from Suslov..."
 komilaws.16.b:0 "Best to be in Gumilyov's good books."
 komilaws.16.c:0 "We have no need for enemies of the Republic!"

 komilaws.17.t:0 "The Municipal Pacification Bill"
 komilaws.17.d:0 "Svetlana Stalina has introduced the Municipal Pacification Bill, calling for vastly increased police funding and rights to use force to break up paramilitary movements, particularly ones involved in street violence. It is a blatant broadside against the Communists and Passionaryy, but it would go a long way in restoring order to the streets. However, both the DSNP and SNR are worried about the public reaction; killing the bill would make them look weak on crime, but endorsing would ensure its passage and make them seem to support police brutality and politicized attacks on their opponents. It remains to be seen what they do about the bill."
 komilaws.17.a:0 "The DSNP and SMR kill the bill in Committee."

I know that you are a very busy man, especially in such important times as these, but I would like to ask you a favor. Gumilyov and the Eurasianists in the Passionariyy are a serious threat to Syktyvkar, and their influence must be curbed. Tell your gangs and paramilitaries to stop going after communists, and instead focus their efforts on Gumilyov's forces. Once I learn of the ceasefire, I will follow suit. This is a very easy decision, comrade, the rightists must be stopped. I trust that you will make the right decision.'\n\nA ceasefire with the communists would give them time to increase the size of their forces, and they could use the extra breathing room to possibly prepare a coup. However, Voznesensky held no love for Gumilyov, and he certainly wouldn't mind seeing his gangs stop openly roaming the streets. Should he agree to the ceasefire?

They need an example, a leader to show them the virtue of charity. I have gone through the trouble of selecting a suitable organization. I feel that in order to make the message hit closer to home, that the donation should be equivalent to US$10,000,' that was a lot of money to simply donate out of the blue, Zhdanov was clearly getting more ambitious with his demands, 'I hope you make the right choice. Sincerely, your friend Zhdanov.'\n\nThe charity Zhdanov had selected was owned by a family with personal ties to Svetlana Bukharina. If Voznesensky accepted the demand, he might as well have been paying the Communist Party directly. Of course, Voznesensky wasn't stupid. If he refused, Zhdanov would surely release his kompromat on him. He pulled the checkbook out of a drawer in his desk, but paused as he uncapped his pen. SHould he do what was best for himself, or should he do what was best for the Republic? If the information in that kompromat was released, Voznesesnky's career was probably over.

The DSNP is in full damage control mode trying to avoid an impeachment push led by the enraged Passionaryy, while the coalition is reeling. The KKP, on the other hand, have no comment on the matter beyond stating that there is nothing in the leaks proving that the Communist leaders involved, most prominently Andrey Zhdanov, had any knowledge of how the "gifts" from the President were done illegally.

 komidiplo.1.d:0 "Our diplomats have received a surprising message today.Ever since the so-called Republic of Komi illegally split from the West Russian Revolutionary Front, relations between our two governments have been tense. Now, under a communist government, the Republic of Komi has decided to request closer ties with the West Russian Revolutionary Front. They seek to reconcile with us over their illegal secession, and engage in peaceful and friendly diplomacy.\n\nOur government is split over what to do regarding this diplomatic request. Some officials call for us to denounce the Komi Republic as illegal splitters who betrayed the front, and instead focus on forcefully integrating them into the Front. Others call for a united Front, and wish to seek warmer relations with Komi, regardless of any past bad blood. A refusal could potentially lead to a future military conflict, but a recognition could show weakness in our government. Regardless, the question is, which clique do we support?"

The Komi diplomats come bearing a request from their government to cross-train our troops and theirs. The Republic will send over some officers to our military bases, and in exchange we will send some in return.\n\nIf we agree to their request, we will have to spare valuable officers and risk military information leaking to unwanted sources.

They also argue this deal does not sufficiently benefit our government, and that this relationship with Komi is an unequal one.

Specifically, our commitment to republicanism has been highlighted, and in general it seems possible for the two governments to co-exist as one, or at least that is what Komi claims.\n\nDespite this, many of our own officials and generals are not so sure about this offer, seeing Komi as a second WRRF, and they do not wish to meddle with communism yet again.

As of today, Vologda is both officially and practically under the control of Syktyvkar.\n\nThe army of the neutral zone has reluctantly declared its allegiance to our cause, although some small problems have occurred by those who do not want to see their lands under communist control. For the most part, the Vologdan government has shown this as the end of the neutrality, not because of force, but because a proper Russian government has been found, and so has managed to gain wide popular support in their move.

As such, war is our only option.\n\nWe must show no mercy in destroying the anti-communist junta to our west. Lacking the ability to field a large, powerful and well-supplied army, they will not be able to resist effectively, and aside from the insignificant resistance that might linger on led by those who are not loyal, they will be dealt with as a threat within a very short amount of time.

Additionally, we expect them to hold the same lust for vengeance as we do for the Germans, and we will continue operating our army within the greater frame of a powerful government that can protect us.\n\nHowever, many still hold reservations about joining Komi.

Thankfully, we did not have to use bloodshed to bring Gorky under our control."
 komidiplo.18.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

 komidiplo.19.t:0 "Gorky Refuses Re-Integration!"
 komidiplo.19.d:0 "Unfortunate news come from the frontier, specifically from Gorky. When we gave the government there an offer to unite with us and help in our struggle, we expected that they would understand the situation they are in. A powerful state built on socialism that is not the WRRF they once broke away from has risen in West Russia. Still believing in socialism and its doctrine, aside from their wish for vengeance against the invaders in the form of massive attacks, it would be logical for them to join us. Yet they didn't. They have declared us to be nothing but another breed of revisionists, and refuse to cooperate.\n\nThere is only one solution now, and it is war. As much as we hate to spill blood against fellow socialists, are they truly faithful in our ideology if they do not follow us? Thus, our war plan to invade Gorky shall be executed by the High Command as soon as possible, and they will easily crumble in front of the powerful Red Army we control."
 komidiplo.19.a:0 "Let's hope we succeed."

 komidiplo.20.t:0 "Komi Sends a Diplomatic Mission!"
 komidiplo.20.d:0 "In the chaotic environment our neutral zone resides in, diplomacy is rarely applied. It matters more if you can overpower the enemy's army than if you can convince them with words and promises. In spite of that common piece of wisdom in post-war Russia, the building that Vologda is governed from from received a surprising visitor today.\n\nThe visitor, dressed formally and serious-looking, explained to government officials of his intent, and that was to conduct diplomacy with Vologda on behalf of our eastern neighbors, the Komi Republic. Well known for its political turmoil between different factions forever locked in a power struggle, the Republic seems to have finally looked outwards and reach out for friends. In fact, the ambassador has mentioned specific terms that would be, at least according to him, beneficial for both our nations.\n\nThe Komi Republic has suggested the creation of a proper diplomatic channel between us and Syktyvkar, so that we can quickly discuss issue and reinforce our relationship. Additionally, even the possibility of an actual alliance between us and them has been strongly implied. The question is if we want to accept the offer to strengthen our relationship, or if we want to maintain our neutrality as we have done for so long."
 komidiplo.20.a:0 "We must accept. Good friends here are rare."
 komidiplo.20.b:0 "We must refuse. We can go on our own."

 komidiplo.21.t:0 "Vologda Accepts our Request!"
 komidiplo.21.d:0 "Great news come from the city of Vologda, across the frontier! Our diplomatic mission which we recently employed has enjoyed great success. It seems that the regime ruling the town is supportive of our efforts to create bilateral relations, and has welcomed the mission with open arms. Now, we can initiate trade of resources and arms for the benefit of both us and Vologda, as well as discuss our future steps, now that talks with them are not a rare occurrence but a possibility every day.\n\nWe must not forget that the goals of this diplomatic effort do not stop at minor trade deals and vaguely cordial relations. The optimal outcome would be for Komi and Vologda to enter into a full alliance, determined to protect themselves from the surrounding enemies that may appear. They may be socialists, monarchists or fascists, but no matter what the two states will have to band together to fight them off. Of course, if we gain enough diplomatic sway, we could even use this to our advantage in expanding. But for now, our ambassador is doing an excellent work at cooperating with the authorities and gaining their trust."
 komidiplo.21.a:0 "Just as planned."
 
 komidiplo.22.t:0 "Vologda Refuses Us!"
 komidiplo.22.d:0 "Unfortunately for us, news from the recent diplomatic mission to the western warlord of Vologda are not positive. The mission, despite the offers it made, and the advantages the alliance with the Komi Republic would bring, failed to gather the support of the regime. While we are not certain what exactly made Vologda refuse the offer, and whether it was due to a specific term or their isolationist tendencies, the end result is the same. The possibility of a mutual alliance against aggression and for the prosperity of democracy in Russia has ended with this failure. Let us not be discouraged by this failure, though; there are bigger fish to fry and we have many other options."
 komidiplo.22.a:0 "Vologda will stand on its own."

 komidiplo.23.t:0 "A Gift from the Republic"
 komidiplo.23.d:0 "We received a message from the Komi Republic this morning, something that becomes more frequent as we strengthen our alliance. It was reported that major industrial experts and economists from our eastern neighbor have closely cooperated in order to create a program for financial aid to Vologda, something we greatly appreciate.\n\nThe "aid pack", as it has come to be commonly referred to by our officials, includes a substantial amount of funds, dedicated to supporting our economy, as well as boosting developing industries, and even some equipment and blueprints. Komi has trusted us to use this for a good cause, and this has helped our mutual friendship. To truly show our appreciation and respect for this gift, we must reply in kind, sending our own aid to the Republic, in funds as well as investments in their industries. Hopefully this will show them how trustworthy their allies are."
 komidiplo.23.a:0 "Let's send them our own aid."

 komidiplo.24.t:0 "Freedom of Movement"
 komidiplo.24.d:0 "As the bonds between us and the Komi Republic continue to strengthen, the government in Syktyvkar has decided to be even more open to us, both figuratively and literally. Yesterday, our diplomatic office in Komi was informed that the frontier between Vologda and them is now open.\n\nGarrison soldiers, wandering merchants and even normal civilians were surprised to see the unofficial demarcation line become effectively a free border. Once fiercely guarded by military troops, anyone who wanted to cross it would have to go through an extensive search by the guards before going to the other side, not to mention the endless other dangers. But now, many breathe a sigh of relief, from traders to separated families, as travel in the region becomes easier.\n\nBeyond the practicality of this act, this is a show of good faith by the Komi Republic, proving our good relations have beared fruit. Of course, to show our appreciation for this, we will need to loosen our control on the frontier as well, by decreasing our forces on the border and gradually ending the control and surveillance over who crosses it."
 komidiplo.24.a:0 "Open the borders."

 komidiplo.25.t:0 "Merging the Republics"
 komidiplo.25.d:0 "To the east of us, a Republic has held control for years since the West Russian War. Some time ago, Komi was considered nothing more than a safe haven for radicals, destined to fall on one extreme of the political spectrum and become yet another threat to our survival, as if Germany and the WRRF were not enough. But it seems that, in the end, democracy prevailed. Not only that, but our former rivals in West Russia have been neutralized by this movement. And now, as Komi continues to assert its control over the region, we stand in its way.\n\nHowever, they have not taken the approach of war and conquest, as seems to be common here, but of negotiations. Specifically, seeing Vologda's commitment to democracy, at least to some extent, and our wish to see the motherland reunited under a better regime, Komi proposed we merge our governments. Both administrations will join to become one, and theoretically, it will be an equal unification, not an annexation. Promises have been made that many of those who govern the city of Vologda now will continue to do so in the future, under the protection of a strong democratic government. Additionally, the messages we have received seem to strongly imply that, should we refuse to accept the offer, since we will be considered enemies of democracy and the nation, violent action will have to be taken by Komi against Vologda..."
 komidiplo.25.a:0 "Clearly, Komi is unable to communicate their true intentions."
 komidiplo.25.b:0 "Accept the offer, for a democratic Russia!"

 komidiplo.26.t:0 "Vologda Declines!"
 komidiplo.26.d:0 "Unbelievably enough, the neutral zone of Vologda has refused to bow down to our authority! In a move of treason against the nation, and defying the wishes of the people for the rule of a strong and democratic government, the military junta governing the city to our west flat out declined the offer for merging the two regimes, stating that they wish to continue enjoying their freedom and their rights as a neutral zone that will not acknowledge any warlord's authority.\n\nWe have already begun our preparations for what is now inevitable, an armed expedition into Vologda. The diplomats have departed the city and returned to Syktyvkar, ending all communications with the neutral zone. Meanwhile, the High Command is finalizing the details of Plan Blue, the codename for the invasion. It will not take long before we are ready for war against the weak regime to our west."
 komidiplo.26.a:0 "This is what happens to traitors."

 komidiplo.27.t:0 "Vologda Votes to Join Komi!"
 komidiplo.27.d:0 "Celebrate, citizens of Komi! Today, Vologda joins our republic!\n\nThe offer for merging the administrations has been welcomed by the semi-authoritarian government in Vologda. It seems they still believe in democracy, and as such they quickly answered our request with a positive response. Quickly, the two militaries ended all limitations to travel between their respective territory, and are working to tear down any border fences or checkpoints. The soldiers near the border have come together, celebrating the unification and meeting their Russian brothers that are no longer enemies on the other side.\n\nMeanwhile, representatives from the military regime we have recently united with have arrived in Syktyvkar, outlining the exact plans and process for the proper integration of their lands into the Republic. In the streets of both our own capital and Vologda, the citizens cheer on our government, and the flag of our nation is waved proudly across our domain."
 komidiplo.27.a:0 "This is truly a day of joy."

 komidiplo.28.t:0 "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.28.d:0 "We have received a curious message today. Diplomats from the so-called Komi Republic, which now borders our free state, have sent us an offer that is not to be taken lightly. They are requesting that Tatarstan join with them as an autonomous Tatar republic. Should we accept their offer, we will retain a good deal of our autonomy and will no doubt be granted a say in their government. However, our days as an independent and sovereign nation will officially be over. If we deny their request, on the other hand, there is no telling how they will react. They may opt for a more direct approach to our annexation..."
 komidiplo.28.a:0 "It is for the best that we join them."
 komidiplo.28.b:0 "Our independence is not up for debate!"

 komidiplo.29.t:0 "Tatarstan Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.29.d:0 "Bad news from our diplomats in Tatarstan. Their arrogant government has outright refused our well-intentioned annexation proposal, and have strongly insisted upon their status as an independent state! Now that we have no other option to settle this matter peacefully, it may be time to activate Plan Violet after all. Forces are to be mobilized to their borders and begin preparing for offensive operations at once. Although the Tatars are known for their ferocity in battle, they are hopelessly outgunned and cannot hold out against our forces for long. Once the dust has settled, a period of occupation will begin to ensure the annexation process goes smoothly."
 komidiplo.29.a:0 "We were hoping it wouldn't come to this."

 komidiplo.30.t:0 "Tatarstan Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.30.d:0 "Good news from our diplomats in Tatarstan! The Tatars have agreed to our generous offer of annexation, and have reached out to us to formalize their integration into our republic. Their little nation, including their politicians and armed forces, are expected to join the fold shortly. An autonomous Tatar republic will soon be established within our borders, but most importantly we have managed to avoid unnecessary bloodshed despite these turbulent times."
 komidiplo.30.a:0 "Diplomacy has won the day!"

 komidiplo.31.t:0 "Komi Promises Autonomy Within The Republic"
 komidiplo.31.d:0 "Ever since the forces of the Komi Republic had arrived at our borders, it was only a matter of time before they would attempt diplomatic overtures. That day has finally arrived, and diplomats representing Komi come bearing an offer that we would do well to consider. They are offering us a great deal of autonomy under their protection, as well as a place in their democratic political systems. Most importantly, however, is that they are guaranteeing full religious freedom for the people of Bashkiria.\n\nThere is no doubt that this is a generous offer, but is it worth giving up our hard-won independence for? If we were to decline, it is possible that further offers will be considerably less generous, and made from the barrel of a gun...\n\nWhat will our answer be?"
 komidiplo.31.a:0 "Their proposal is generous, we will accept."
 komidiplo.31.a:0 "No, they are not to be trusted!"
 
 komidiplo.32.t:0 "Bashkiria Refuses Our Offer!"
 komidiplo.32.d:0 "Troubling news from Bashkiria. It seems our diplomats have come home empty-handed, and the Bashkirs have reaffirmed their wishes to remain an independent islamic republic. Despite making a generous offer in good faith, it seems as though it was not enough to satisfy the fiercely zealous Bashkirs. We have no choice but to fall back to Plan Yellow.\n\nThis simple, robust strategy emphasizes eliminating any hostile Bashkir forces as quickly as possible, and includes plans for a temporary occupation government once offensive actions have ceased. Their army, although zealous and well-motivated, is outclassed by a considerable margin and the invasion is not expected to last very long."
 komidiplo.32.a:0 "They leave us no choice."

 komidiplo.33.t:0 "Bashkiria Agrees To Annexation!"
 komidiplo.33.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Bashkiria, and they bring with them promising news! The Bashkirs have agreed to our terms and now wish to discuss the finer details of their integration. This process is not expected to take long, and soon they will be integrated into our nation as an autonomous Bashkir republic with full religious rights guaranteed. On top of all this, their citizens will be given an equal say in our democratic processes. With this agreement in place, we have successfully expanded our influence into this region without firing a shot."
 komidiplo.33.a:0 "The pen is mightier than the sword."

 komidiplo.34.t:0 "An Anti-Bolshevik Pact?"
 komidiplo.34.d:0 "Ever since the West Russian War ended in a humiliating defeat for the cowardly forces of the West Russian Revolutionary Front, a specific status quo was established in the region, one that most soon came familiar with. Of course, there have been times where it has been shaken up, but for the most part, it has remained the same. For us, a pocket of Tsarism surrounded by potential enemies on all sides, it is crucial to use this state of things to our advantage, and the political developments in the Komi Republic have certainly helped with that.\n\nEver since the domination of the right-wing, nationalist forces in Syktyvkar, the diplomatic office of Vyatka has wondered if something could be done to make use of this political group in power. However, it now seems that they have decided to make the first move. We have just received a telegram from the republic to the north, in which they ask regarding the prospects of a mutual alliance against our common enemy, the WRRF.\n\nOur diplomats have quickly analyzed the situation that such an agreement could bring to West Russia. Of course, the nationalists of Komi are ideologically aligned, for the most part, to us, and could provide a shield against the strong communist forces threatening us from the north. Effectively, they could become our buffer state. In the end, what will our response be? Will we accept this proposal for a pact against our ideological enemies, or abandon the people who still do not bow under the Tsar's authority?"
 komidiplo.34.a:0 "Together, we are stronger."
 komidiplo.34.b:0 "Our road is ours to tread."

 komidiplo.35.t:0 "Vyatka Agrees to Cooperate"
 komidiplo.35.d:0 "Today, the forces of anti-Bolshevism make a great step in defeating even the last pocket of red in the free Russian territories. The message we have sent to the warlord state of Vyatka, vaguely aligned with our ideological goals, has received a positive reply. Likely coming to the realization that we are one of their few hopes for survival and flourishing in the region, they have been quick to voice their agreement for a mutual assistance pact.\n\nThe developments from the moment the reply was received have been surprisingly rapid. The minister of foreign affairs for our republic and their counterpart in Vyatka have come into contact, and are now in the process of scheduling the meeting in which the alliance will be officially signed. However, as often happens with these backdoor diplomatic arrangements, many of the points of the alliance have already been discussed behind the scenes.\n\nThe deal will include a promise that, should one signatory be attacked, the other will have to abide by the treaty and come to the aid of their ally. Limited military presence in the form of advisors and attachés will also likely be a term. Finally, a number of economic and military support between the two nations is more than likely to be included. From now on, Vyatka fiercely stands by us as our great ally."
 komidiplo.35.a:0 "Good to see we finally have some friends."

 komidiplo.36.t:0 "Vyatka Refuses our Offer"
 komidiplo.36.d:0 "When the telegram looking into the possibilities of an alliance with the monarchists to our south was sent to Vyatka, we expected that Tsar Vladimir would see how much we have in common, and how dire our situation is against numerous enemies. However, from what we can gather from the reply hastily sent by their own foreign office, the minute differences in our ideologies have been enough for them to reject the offer for an alliance, or at least justify doing so.\n\nOf course, we have been limited to our beliefs of the greatness of the Russian nation and its people, as well as their will to oppose the communists, the Germans, and all other enemies. We chose not to blindly follow the ideals of monarchism, that only appealed to the elite of the elite, and ignored the true will of the people of all classes. Despite the doubts by very few of the right's members, perhaps we were absolutely right in doing so.\n\nAny diplomatic channels and backdoors between Ust-Sysolsk and Vyatka that remained open have been closed in the aftermath of what is perceived as a diplomatic betrayal, especially when the WRRF looms over us ominously. For all intents and purposes, all prospects of befriending the Tsarists have ended. From now on, the only diplomatic interaction we will ever have again will be their instrument of surrender when war inevitably comes between us and them."
 komidiplo.36.a:0 "Much more dangerous threats exist right now."

 komidiplo.55.d:0 "The theorists of the Komi Republic are its most solid fixture. For every ideological belief with traction, it seems there are a half-dozen men and women struggling to explain away the contradictions and analytical diversity of their chosen bloody hill of ideology. In fact, the sheer factionalism of every missive that comes out of the Republic is one of the reasons for the WRRF's hesitance in initiating official diplomatic ties in the wake of the Socialist change in leadership. It would simply be bad praxis to disrupt a situation that can charitably be described as, ah, dynamic.\n\nWhich is why it comes as a surprise to the men and women gathered in the United Front's Arkhangelsk Central Party Headquarters when the letter from Komi comes co-signed by half the factions in its Communist Party. It appears the cats have herded themselves, as a General dryly comments, into the fold.\n\nThe letter proposes, in a burst of rhetoric that is so ideologically packed it is unreadable in portions, a merger of interests. The Revolutionary Front has dedicated itself to military protection of the Socialist ideal. The Republic has spent much time and energy on developing the theoretical depth of Russian Socialism. A merger of the two, with the Komi Republic leading administrative affairs and the Arkhangelsk government transitioning to a proper military role, would surely be preferable to the mutual vulnerability of an arms' length relationship.\n\nIt is a tempting offer, but there is one major flaw to the plan that the letter has not spelled out: the Arkhangelsk government is not particularly trusting of the functionaries of a Republic that has never known the struggles of the North. Only the realisation that this alliance could give the Red Army an inroad into the South and West gives the proposal leeway in the debate - and even then, it is a matter of balanced odds, not inevitability."
 komidiplo.55.a:0 "Pah! We will go our own way!"

We had, all of us, nursed doubts as to the ideological consistency of men whose guns seemed so often to outweigh their convictions. Why did the Revolutionary Frontists choose to give their senior Generals, with unclear connections to their Politburo, fiefdoms that were autonomous from their main territory? How could the Revolutionary Front's civilian policy not consider the role of autonomous, Socialist Party organs in developing ideological devotion in the local Proletariat?\n\nWe now know that the Clique - those red-painted jackals in waiting! - were not conflicted over their bizarre attempts at imposing Socialism at gunpoint. In all truthfulness, this author doubts if the Revolutionary Front was ever truly committed to Socialism at all, other than as a way to further the cause of their bourgeois crypto-nationalism. All illusions must henceforth be dispelled, all hopes released, all expectations destroyed. The truth is that Arkangelsk, far from being our salvation, has turned out to be yet another rightist, deviationist gang of armed men devoted only to perverting the Revolution into their twisted, violent image.\n\nIf there is anything to be learnt from this state of affairs, it is our renewed understanding that only a commitment to the Party Line can ensure true loyalty to the Revolution. Just think! Had it not been for the Party of the Republic, we would have been as prone as any other people in Russia to the disease that is warlordism. We thank Arkhangelsk for this, and only this - because of their stubbornness, we have been inoculated from this disease once and for all."

The time has come to use the massive armaments Arkhangelsk has gathered - the warlords around our scattered domains are restless. They see the march of history in their eyes. The time is coming when they will attempt to stop it.\n\nWe must simply beat them to the punch. Let us not be afraid of the future, comrades. The triumph was long delayed, but it, like the World Revolution, like the spinning of the world itself, will come one day.

He was not a particularly expressive man, but occasionally he afforded his mind the luxury of imagination as a dog might be afforded a leash on a warm day. It wasn't like he didn't have the time, anyway - [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] had sent him here, on this "fact-finding mission", to scout out something he could present the Republic with shiny fetters and trimmed ribbons on the sides.\n\nHe shrugged. It was time to take his imagination for a walk.\n\nThe name of the factory had long been lost, and what appeared to have been a bomb-blast had sharded most of the walls in the east wing. Even so, there was plenty of evidence remaining to suggest that this place had once been a hive of activity: here and there the familiar white-scrabble of concrete and steel loomed in the building's innards, surrounded by brilliant rust-red rings of dust. Streaks of rust and scraped-off concrete indicated the presence of what must have been lights, equipment, presses and hydraulic wires.\n\nHow long had it been since the walls had hummed with activity, as they no doubt once had? When had the lights gone out, and how many had whiled away their youth playing soldier amidst the ruins? Rodionov thought to the interviews he'd held with the townsfolk in the little village to the left. So few of them left, and so many empty houses. Gone with the money, or its lack, and the hope leached from their faces like a blanket sodden too long in bleach. The years had been bleak to old Russia, and the wind harsh - and who could tell if it would continue?\n\nHis feet crunched on something, and he raised his boot away, squinting. Thick-woven cotton, a few buttons, a face and body and little cloth-knotted arms, and on the face a little smile - a child's doll, here in the ruins of Russian industry.

Even so, once the letter made it to [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] there was little to do but apologise. It was an intrusion, after all, and no doubt the President would simply laugh it off or spend another afternoon on the phone, fulminating to Zhdanov or whoever had caught the man's eye these days.\n\nThe staffer unfortunate enough to chance upon [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] later in the afternoon caught him at his worst: passionate, fiery, with a trace of the old vigor - dangerous in the way a lit match threatens the hand. [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] seized the staffer by the arms, calling at once a staff meeting to address the miners' deplorable safety conditions and their degraded working hours. The meeting lasted five hours, and their response-plan five more: the rays of dawn heralded the end of the latter.\n\nThe President, however, was bound by no such petty rules as the need to sleep. By dawn he had chauffeured a handy staff-car, dragging his aides along to "speak" directly with the management of that little mine southwest of Syktyvkar, and whatever he told the Company men, it worked. The headlines blared the President's name and a handy little picture of a smiling [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] held aloft by exultant sweaty men for a week straight, declaring him a MAN OF THE PEOPLE and a PROGRESSIVE ICON.\n\nTo the exhausted Staffers planning his celebratory campaign, half-dead from overwork and on unpaid overtime, it almost seemed worth the trouble."

He hadn't even agreed to the damned meeting, so why had the President authorized a "mandatory getaway" from his duties in the Army to attend it? Presently a staffer, dressed in formal slacks, put on a painfully plastic smile and clapped for attention. "Gentlemen, I welcome you to the first meeting of the Republic of Komi Electoral Committee. Please, let us go around the table and say a little about where we come from and what we do."\n\nAs Korolkov listened, his face grew ever more set, and his heart chilled. He'd learned from young to tell when someone was speaking about something they didn't believe. Their eyes never met yours, or their words were oddly stilted or lilting. Something about the human voice was a consummate betrayer of intent. Every one of the members of the table had a voice that betrayed him. Their gazes were false, and when they spoke of the enthusiasm they shared for the Electoral Commission red flags began to appear before Korolkov's own mental gaze.\n\nKorolkov kept his voice level as he rose to speak, but on a sudden tide of conviction he decided to probe a little. "Gentlemen, I believe that we have only breached the surface, as it were. I wish to hear a little more about why [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] chose you - for our common will must be built through our understanding of our individual purposes. What can we bring to democracy - and how can we bring it about?"\n\nThe men looked to him, then around them, and they began to laugh. One slapped the table, chuckling as he got the words out. "Oh, Korolkov, you're funny. You're right. Let's admit it, folks - " The man gestured expansively to a nodding audience. "We were picked because we stand to gain from it all. We don't need to pretend at fairness, and we won't. Democracy is when [GetNIKSocDemLeaderLast] wants things done, right?"\n\nThe man leaned close, almost predatory in his sudden smile. "And the more he wants done - the more democratic his elections will be.""

One boy - Pavlovich, with the curly hair - raises his hand tentatively. She nods to him. "Yes, Pavlovich."\n\n"Demok - democracy is when people choose what they want to happen! Like when Dad and Mom choose between me and my brother to help at the shop!" Komorova nods approvingly. "That's right, Pavlovich. Very good. Democracy is when we choose the important things - not just who does the weekly chores, but also our leaders, what we dream about for our country. Our futures."\n\n"And Socialism is when the Government does things!" A voice rings from the back of the class, jubilant in its confidence. Dana.

For most of her young life, the weekly trip to the town market had been something to avoid. The shopkeepers had been hostile and the shoppers angry. Arguments over weights and prices had often turned into scary shouting matches around her.\n\nThat scary market was now firmly a thing of the past, at least to Zora. For the first time she could remember, basic goods were plentiful. There were more smiles to be seen, fewer arguments, and most importantly, a plethora of new faces, stalls and goods on offer. It seemed every market day there was something new to see, smell or taste! The Shaurma she'd shared with her father last week still made her mouth water just thinking about it.\n\nAs they walked to the town square, she was running circles around her mother, nipping impatiently at her coat. Once the market came into view, her mother gave her a warm smile and a small coin. "Run along, Alsu, and enjoy yourself. Find me in front of old Mustafaev's stall in an hour's time." The words had barely left her mouth before the girl was running full sprint, off to find other excited girls and boys and to see, smell, taste and experience everything her 10 kopeks could buy."

In fact, there is no provision that allows it. The newly elected councilors will sit for the full four years," he answered in unaccented Tatar. The first half hour now spent making assurances that the failure to produce a majority was not due to the electorate doing something wrong, somehow, they were starting to get somewhere.\n\n"Since no party can command the council by themselves, they will have to work together. Many cities already do this. Sometimes they have stable alliances that rule together, sometimes the largest party builds different coalitions from issue to issue.

Valery promised himself that once this was all over, he would take some time out of his schedule to speak some very deliberate words to the visual designer.\n\nWell, it wasn't like the logo was important. Taking his placard, Valery began the twenty-minute trek to his appointed District. He had at least gotten lucky with the placing: he'd heard some volunteers would have to stay overnight thanks to the travel time back and forth. As he arrived in the little park-square, he set up his placard next to a couple of chairs with a sign hung between lamp-lights: A CONVERSATION ABOUT DEMOCRACY! ALL WELCOME!\n\nThe first to approach the improvised booth he'd set up was a pensioner, a lady in her sixties clutching a handbag. Valery helped her into the seat opposite his as she snarled at him. "Get out of my district, reactionary. This place isn't for your type and it never will be."\n\nValery simply smiled, drawing his secret weapon from his bag: a flask of tea, chilled and thoroughly stirred. "Reactionary? That's an interesting word to use, madam. I'd like to hear more about what you have to say about us - and if I'm not wrong, you stay on Petrov Street, don't you? Our representatives have never been to the area..."\n\nThe afternoon wore on, clouds scudding and fading across the patterned bands of the horizon. Valery danced with words, taking the lady on a tour of democratic ideals, PSD's manifesto and policymaking, and the agenda of Unionism. By the time the lady left, her head was full of strange new thoughts and something even stranger.

Many of my own interactions were with factory managers who expected only the good things in life, not the responsibility to think about their implications.\n\nThis event, however, shows genuine promise for the District. I'm not sure whether to peg it to the laudable enthusiasm displayed by our surveyors, or to the warmth and compassion of the services we've offered under our The Government Works For All campaign. Either way, we believe the many agencies we've collaborated with deserve rich praise for their conduct during this campaign, and the near 60-percent increase in voting registrations rests in no small part on their many shoulders. Special thanks go to the Mitvol family, whose invaluable help in setting up our conversational tea-booths boosted our public image immensely. (Note: consider roping them into our People's Agencies?)\n\nWe should not, however, take an isolated success as a surefire guarantee of future victories. Below I have outlined aspects of our Public Relations in which, I believe, we can do better. To summarize, we should consider a mail-voting approach for our elderly voters, and tie that in with campaigns targeted at elderly and dependent households - these demographics are less likely to vote if we do not come to them.\n\nEven so, let us not shy away from calling a spade a spade: on behalf of the Government of Russia, I would like to thank our constituents and tireless workers for what has been a hugely successful campaign.

They crossed each street once or twice, leaving a trail of paper behind them, and then they left for the town centre. Noises and the echo of audiovisual equipment could be heard through noon, as residents hid in their beds and snapped obscenities at the menace. For the men and women who bothered looking at the leaflets, not much awaited them - four words, SCREENING AT TOWN CENTRE, were the only words of substance on the thin little paper-rolls.\n\nTowards noon the gathering began. Soldiers walked door to door, escorting smiling men in suits who styled themselves 'recruiters' - they sought the young men first, those who looked capable of military service but with no occupation. Then they asked for the old men, then the working-women: it appeared no part of the town was safe from their ungentle queries. Men and women were herded towards the town-square, the gaze of the soldiers around them a prod for their movements, and into an involuntary movie-theater.\n\nAs the patriotic movie was broadcast on the side of a residential building, recruiters moved amongst the ranks, reminding the gathered of their responsibilities. Their faith, their God, their families - all needed defending. All needed to be preserved. And who would go, they whispered, if not them? All that was needed would be a signature, only a signature, to help keep the Rodina safe.\n\nIf there was any doubt in the minds of those with different convictions, it was dispelled as soldiers formed barriers between the audience and the outside world. Here, in this small town, the Army would take everything - and there would be no resistance."

 komi_despotism.5.d:0 "President Stalina looked down once more at the bill which lay on her desk, the lines on its cover sheet unmarred and blank. Its title was unassuming - a bureaucratic euphemism, typical of laws passed by the National Assembly, in the age of the newly unified western Russia. The National Sovereignty Act - the culmination of weeks of research, drafting, and committee votes, and the greatest stride yet towards achieving the Sovereign Democratic Party's agenda of a strong, independent Russia.\n\nWithin it was everything that she had advocated for, on the campaign trail, regarding the threat of foreign imperialism and dependency. Limits on trade performed without defensive obligations, limits on debt, an increased import duty... all of it would serve towards the ultimate cause, the cause of a Russia free from threat both external and internal. A Russia which would be seen by the world as an equal power in its own right, a Russia which one day could stand alongside the United States itself as a bastion of democracy and stability.\n\nShe looked up, once more, nodding to the cameras which clustered around her desk, littered with papers. Her silver pen glided across the paper, leaving her signature on the line marked "APPROVED". The reporters clapped politely, but her focus was elsewhere, out the window. Far away, she imagined, in every city and town of Russia, every mansion, apartment, or rural hut, the people of the Republic now lived in a world that had just become a little bit safer for Russia."

Sheepdogs, Stalina mouthed at them as they spoke. Blind little men who were too damn headstrong to know which way the wind was blowing. How had she worked with them for so long without tiring of the effort?\n\nPresently they were speaking regarding the latest Political Reservation measures, measures she'd put in place to ensure the safety of the State. These idiots were playing the audience like a fiddle, speaking of the dangers of "overreach" - they didn't have the good sense to see the threats only the President could ever see. Was this how that fool Voznesensky had felt?\n\nGod, she couldn't believe the nerve of these people. At least her Party men had the good sense to remain silent. Well, this latest bill would shut up the yapping once and for all. Hiding her growing irritance she waved for the Speaker to admit her name to the list.\n\nSavouring the looks on the legislators' faces as she did so, Stalina spoke in what seemed almost like glee: "Under the auspices of the Executive Directive Act, I declare the Political Reservation Measures under discussion today a matter of National Security. Discussion of this topic is hereby curtailed; now, if I could invite the audience to examine page 63 of our latest Economic Budget..."\n\nWatching the sheepdogs storm out of the Chamber, Stalina felt something churn in her stomach. Something primal stirred within her, deep and angry and wanting to break things, and she felt the bars of her mind clanging with the thing's attempts to break free."

Something very bad was about to happen, and he could feel it creating upon him with no way of pushing back.\n\nStalina gestured in a grand, flowing movement. "Yahontov, please! Have a seat. It's a pleasure to meet you after all this time." Nikolai sat gingerly at the table, not daring even to look at the proffered teacup. "Do you know why you are here, Nikolai?"\n\n"My - my Party, Madame President. The Russian Democratic All-Union League. Please, Madame - we have never insulted anyone of importance, not after Kosygin, anyway."\n\n"At ease, Yahontov. We are here to congratulate you for your service to the Republic, and your honest conviction in bettering its people." Yahontov could scarcely blush before Stalina struck a final blow. "And we are here to commemorate the end of that service. From today, the noble burdens of struggle will be lifted from your Party, and you will be allowed to celebrate in the perfect Republic we have created. It will be dissolved, as are all unnecessary instruments."\n\nYahontov stared, the life seeping from his eyes, as Stalina raised her cup, raw triumph shining from her own. "Please, Nikolai.

 komi_despotism.8.d:0 "Morozov's little clique had dwindled with the recent shifts in the Republic's political atmosphere. Everyone could tell that the merger - well, the devouring, to put it truthfully - of the SMR had negated its political value entirely, and no one expected the Party of Steel to yield to a bunch of refugees on any policy of substance. Even so, there remained the tiny, dubious hope of being allowed to speak freely on intra-party policy. It was a mere sliver of political concessions, but that was all that could be afforded.\n\nMost had simply lost hope, in part yielding to the new circumstances, in part simply tiring of it all. Morozov lost friends, one by one, in the trickle back to the provinces and villages. One last act of protest. Morozov was left to wonder if anything would survive of Kosygin's brainchild - in theory or practice - when the reign of the PSD came to an end. Assuming, of course, it came to an end at all.\n\nMorozov preferred not to think along those lines. Perhaps the residual unease was why receiving the news of the new Democratisation Order gave him such a wild joy - the President had been explicit in her orders, and he looked forward to retrieving his old membership rolls. A new beginning was here for his movement.\n\nAs he looked on, however, darkness once again clouded his vision: for it appeared that someone had gone through his membership records with a sharp eye and a sharper knife. Members, here and there, had been lost - the Party's best and brightest - and Stalina had been very, very explicit about not seeking out members beyond the records. It appeared that Morozov's free party was in fact free only to form a party: everything else was up for debate."

We have spoken much in the previous session regarding the present freedoms of our political system. I know many of you are privately questioning the meaning of my words: how can it be, you say, that while the PSD holds a ironclad majority here other parties can be free to act? Is this not the definition of a soft autocracy? Let me correct these misguided beliefs."\n\n"These parties are not constrained by their small size - indeed, by preventing overspill of dedicated Opposition candidates whose only purpose is to cause trouble for us, they will be free to act as policy guidance bodies for the body politic: we are similarly free to follow their advice when it is best for the country, as befits our status as the dominant political entity. We are to act as older brothers, too: always nurturing to our lessers and juniors, while retaining the endless patience necessary to teach them to be better."\n\n"But when it comes down to it - when it is time to really get this country going - the elder brother must take the steering wheel, and he cannot afford any distractions. This is the real freedom of the dominance of the PSD: that while the SMR and the DSNP will be free to speak, they will never suffer the burdens of actual leadership. Only the PSD can bear this burden, and we will do so without question, until Russia is safe, and our long battle will end.""

She'd pulled in many cases for candidates desperately opposed to her regime, but she was convinced after long nights of study that these represented the scattershot leaders of the Republic. They were her backup plan, her shadow government where the Assembly failed, and in that capacity they would serve an invaluable role.\n\nThe Friends Without. Old Grigachev here, a fighter for 20-odd years for his Miners' Syndicate against near odds, against the Government and against her own faction at times. A grizzled unionist, and one who had never had the benefit of despair. Invaluable. Police Commissioner Lvovich, a literal walking contradiction: he'd fought the Mayor of his city tooth and nail over expanded police budgets and unlimited civil emergency statutes, a committed man of peace in a Republic that found the latter increasingly outmoded.\n\nAnd there were the Enemies Within: her old contender Korolkov, the Leftist Without A Cause. She hadn't gone a month without some kind of sparring between his allies in the military and her own faction of the PSD, especially since the man was, by all accounts, incorruptible as he was stubborn. And who could forget the devil from her own party, the Loyal Oppositionist, Mizayov? She'd been one of the most terrifying debaters in the Party before Stalina had managed to integrate their ideals into a united force, in the early days - even now she was facing dogged resistance in the Legislative Branch for a controversial stance on the latest welfare bills, and coming out all the stronger for it.\n\nAs they stared in mutual confusion at the empty room, Stalina cleared her throat and rose to speak. The room fell silent before her. Men and women who'd fought harder than her for their ideals, and they would get the chance to fight for them one last time, against even herself. Anything was worth Russia - even alliance with old nemeses."

Any moment she would fall off, and the game would be lost, and the long work would be lost with it. No, this was not the time for some idle nonsense! Only an objective examination of the facts would do. Rousing within herself the old strength she relied on, she stared at the current Bill.\n\nThe present draft would pass muster as it stood, she was sure. Increases in public security budgets and extraordinary provisions for law enforcement, investigations into public journalism outlets with suspicious sources, a crackdown on radical unionism: that was surely uncontroversial. And yet she wondered if she should make it lighter - perhaps only an investigation of formal socialist parties instead of a blanket attack on the Unions? Yes, it seemed better to adopt a gentle touch.\n\nAnd yet it seemed woefully incomplete, almost vulnerable, in the space of an eye's blink. No, better to be harsh and stable than to regret leniency! Yes, a forced destruction of independent outlets here - and here - surely that would bring the Republic's radicals to its knees.

If there were signs of protest, they were certainly well hidden (although the recent Public Security Act was very comprehensive, it was not supernatural).\n\nShe felt tired, hollowed out, even. The preceding months had taken their toll on her sleep schedule, and she'd been through so many arguments with her closest staff that she sometimes felt ashamed to greet them in the morning. It felt like a vast abyss separated her from the old Stalina, the committed Democrat, the speech-writer and rabble-rouser. Would her past self even like the person she had become?\n\nStalina sighed. Perhaps this was how her father had felt in the last years of his life. Withdrawn and burnt out by the endless contention for power - it was no wonder the old Steel had rusted and broken, and with what to show for it? A footnote in the history books, and a milquetoast reference to extremism. Well, she'd done her best to follow in his best impression - and she'd succeeded. Her work in the Republic was safe for the time being, from enemies without and within.\n\nPerhaps this was another story she would tell herself as age descended, and perhaps she would stop believing in it altogether one day.

What if he were to transpose that West Russian counteroffensive onto the local terrain? Specifically, the one that led through the north Urals like so - and so -\n\nThe terrain maps proved his undoing. The planned advance of the armored column would move through a valley they couldn't recon, and it was the only chokepoint for miles. No, the strategy employed by the Armored Corps wouldn't work unless they wanted to rapidly turn their finest armor into smoking junk. Nabatov sighed.

His legs turning to jelly from the exultance and stress, Nabatov scribbled a few hasty notes and rose to find the Strategic Briefing Notes. And then, for the first time in two days, he could sleep."

The thud of a binder punctuated the last words, and Strelkov flinched. At least the Commander hadn't aimed for his head this time. "If the Council truly believes that this newfangled strategy is what is best, I think it best that we safeguard the real power far away from them until they are disabused of the notion."\n\nStrelkov nodded helplessly. "Commander Grigorenko! Please, this is not a usurpation or anything of the sort. We are simply attempting to better strategy now that our Air Force is in working condition. After all, we in the Republic cannot afford casualties the same way large countries can - "\n\nAnother binder-thud, this one louder than the first. "You are delusional if the air-land strategy will safeguard our losses! Strelkov, I have been working for close to a decade in the Military, and our entire operational doctrine has been configured to work with combined armor-infantry operations. The Air Force will only complicate this state of affairs by stealing resources and money from us."\n\nStrelkov kneaded his temples. "Commander, there is to be no stealing - we will allocate funds as we deem fit for the health of the Republic. Moreover, we are aware that the transition to air-land battle will take quite awhile, which is why we need you on board. Who else could train with us?"\n\nGrigorenko simply shook his head. "Tell your Council that they have two options: they can stick with my suggestions, or they can stumble around in the dark by themselves. I will not stand for this strategic blunder, and I could not live with myself if I were to further it. Now go.""

 komi_dem_generic.4.d:0 "There hadn't been a fistfight in the General Headquarters for quite awhile now, and so Korolkov was taken by surprise when the latest iteration broke out. It had been sudden, too - one minute there was a reasonable discussion regarding prioritization of funding to be given to the Military Research Department, the next a full-on fistfight had been in progress, with men in middle age on both sides struggling to either restrain or deck their peers.\n\nKorolkov sighed. Another day in the Ministry of Defense and its assembled glories. Well, glories was a strong term, but he lacked another word for it.\n\nAt least this paperwork would be of use to the Republic - a paper drafted by one of his staffers on the movement of hybridized troops in the last days of the West Russian War, and a note on how to make it applicable to the Republic's current situation. Poring through its conclusions, Korolkov nodded, making notes in the margins. There was plenty of work to be done to bring the military up to parity with its contemporaries, and this would definitely help.\n\nA stubble-headed member of the General Staff approached him, and Korolkov got up to show the formalities. "Stand down. I'm looking for a paperback, something to fill the gap on someone's chair. Hmm, have you seen any spare binders? Preferably something slim? Ah, this will do," and the paperwork was snatched from Korolkov's desk.\n\nThe General Staff member retreated, and Korolkov kneaded his temples in frustration. This was his third day of promotion, and already he missed nothing more than the lowly status of his previous position. The Republic, he was certain, was doomed regardless; but at least he had been blind to it beforehand."

 komi_dem_generic.5.d:0 "Yefimova's father had whispered dreams to her when she was a child: dreams of a shining fleet of ships, flying the Red Ensign in unison. Each ship, he had told her, was far bigger than the fishing junk they shared: they had guns, ammunition stores, quarters for dozens of people on each ship, and the burnished steel shone like gold in the sun's rays, like some forgotten treasure brought to light.\n\nOf course, that had been a long time ago, he had whispered, and now the Republic they were in was landlocked, and the dream, for now, was dead. But one day the Great Fleet would rise again, and Russia would once again take to the seas: perhaps not in her lifetime, but one day...\n\nYefimova listened as the cold winds drifted about their junk, and as she grew, she learned. She taught herself knotting, sailing, drifting, using only the stars and the harsh Northern spirit for navigation, and as she grew in wisdom her fishing fleet expanded from one to a half-dozen. She had grown powerful, but when the Republican Navy had sent its letter of invitation, she knew what she had to do. A vision, after all, was worthless if not fulfilled.\n\nShe wished her father could see her now, standing upon the deck of the Republic's latest vessel. He'd always been foolish, and perhaps a little too attached to the drink at the end, but he'd never wavered, and her dreams were his dreams, too.\n\nAnd watching the flag fly above a silver-sheened ocean, gulls flying overhead as the engine whirred, Yefimova felt something in her heart glow. Her father, wherever he was, could rest now. His dream was here, in the flesh, and she was living it for him."

The defect he'd been warned about was clear as day now: it bent just a little forward, forcing the shooter's position down by a hair's breadth. Perhaps it was acceptable in Zlatloust, where standards were as low as the Altai Basin's dunes, but not here. He lowered the gun and began to pore over the blueprints scattered around him in a half-blossom.\n\nPerhaps it had been the material, or perhaps there was a structural cause in sight. The latter would explain why the soldiers on the Testing Squad had complained so bitterly about the loading and unloading drills. Something about the barrel, then - but their reports had focused on the firing-pin mechanism itself, so it couldn't possibly be that. Maybe in the way the barrel interacted with the firing pin? Yes, perhaps the explosion of the shot had cracked something within.\n\nA passing soldier yelled, "Korenev! Hard at work? It's almost lunch!" Koronev, barely looking up, greeted him and told him, in no uncertain terms, to go away. The soldier giggled as he left: it was adorable, the way Korenev was so immersed in his work he was blind to everything else. Absolutely adorable.\n\nKorenev's mind was far away, however: the rifle, as did all the equipment he'd been given, preoccupied him. Some solution needed to be found in the meantime. The barrel problem would probably need a full rework of the design, perhaps even a back to basics test. But the main problem, as he saw it, was the drooping. Perhaps - yes - that would have to do.\n\nKorenev scribbled: PUT SOME EXTRA STOCK ON THE RIFLE AND TELL THEM TO AIM HIGHER. Satisfied, he nodded and went on to the next rifle."

The Budget simply didn't have enough room for the additions of tank units to the Regiments of the existing armor corps. It would be necessary to reconsolidate their existing assets into a single unit, and retrain them day and night until they could perform the roles they'd missed.\n\nSo the People's Hussar Division, as it was known (no one could remember the actual number and reference), was formed, and the farmers and their sons and daughters watched the tanks move row on row into distant fields, towards the base where they were to be christened in a new name and mould.\n\nThere were failures, as there always were: a few of the new models, fresh from the factory, had broken down in a muddy field, and no one was yet sure if it was equipment failure or a planning error that had brought them down. The rest of the models were dragged onto the main road and confined to purely motorized activity until something could be done with them - time would tell if they needed a rebuild or if they could serve a supplementary function in the Motorized Corps.\n\nEven so, as the base commanders noted the plates and licenses of the tanks arrayed, there was reason for celebration. This new division already had plans in the works for a full-blown multi-branch exercise, and some whispered that its commanding officer was a glory hound who would push his men to the limit. There was a sense of general anticipation - this one, it was believed, would go far, and it would take the Republic with it."

His rusty old wristwatch had been a gift from Dad, but there was no sign of his father's precision now as he watched the dusty road. It had been, if this little contraption was accurate, almost half an hour since the scheduled delivery to the Military Academy. How the hell was he supposed to get there on time?\n\n"Yes, far indeed. I've been waiting forty-five minutes myself." There was a twinkle in the other man's eye. Sokalov sized him up, suspicious as a miner's son in a poor district could be of someone who looked suspiciously bourgeois. Dressed in relatively well-tailored clothing, with a little cap to stave off the wind - this man looked nothing like what he'd been told to encounter. "I don't believe we've met. I'm Semyon. You?"\n\nSokalov glared at the hand, then relented and shook. "I'm Sokalov. South of Syktyvkar. You with the Academy?" Semyon - if that was his real name - nodded, his smile firm on his face. "Well then, I suppose we'll get acquainted eventually. What's your designated specialisation?" The man rustled about in his breastpocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. "Ah, I'm assigned to Artillery and Fire Control. You're Infantry Standards, I take it? I know they're taking a lot of them these days, and you seem the type."\n\nSokalov nodded, chuckling a little. "Can't believe they sent me to Vyatka after sending me into the roughbodies - think the Army wants to kill me, between the both of us." Semyon chuckled back, and the air between them grew easy. "Why did you sign up? This course ain't gonna be easy for none of us."\n\nThe man seemed almost shy. "The same reason as you. I love my country." He waved to the fields around them, boundless as the sky itself. "And I want to keep it free." Sokalov nodded. The two were very different, but they were going to get along just fine."

WELCOME, BROTHERS FROM RUSSIA is plastered virtually everywhere in the airport, and the questions seem to be fired in volleys for maximal damage. It's all the bodyguards can do to keep him safe from the chaos.\n\nIt gets a little better when the Ambassador is ushered to the Finnish Government's official headquarters. There the mob of intense reporters is locked out, and the only man in a suit the Ambassador must face is the Prime Minister. Unfortunately, what he lacks in numbers he more than makes up for in intensity: there seems no escaping from his intense, silent gaze.\n\nAt least the conversation starts cordial. The Ambassador makes polite small talk, drawing from the little he knows of the Finnish within his own country: he talks of music, culture, shared brotherhood. The Prime Minister replies in kind, but there is something in his eyes that reminds the Ambassador of a butcher checking his latest cut for its weight and value. Something transactional, something shallow.\n\nThen the Prime Minister looks him in the eye and asks: What is the status of the occupied territory of Karelia? The room seems to drop a hundred degrees in minutes. What answer could there possibly be?\n\nAs the Ambassador squirms in his seat, a fish fresh out of water, the Prime Minister guffaws and bear-hugs him. Welcome to Finland, he says.

I promise all of you, no worker of this republic will ever be ignored again!"\n\nAs he finished the speech, Voznesensky looked into the eyes of everyone in the room.

The Congress of the Soviets has been formed, the long struggle over who to select and who to reject for the Presidium finished. It is coming to a close, at long last, and the business of real governance can truly begin.\n\nHer hand trembles as she reads aloud the words, each blending into the next, and the Congress registers her candidates with polite and faceless nods. A unionist here. A politician there. A general or two thrown in for diversity's sake. She can't quite remember the specifics of everything anymore - her head is trembling with the effort necessary to stand as it is - but what she does know is that while she was still lucid, she had taken measures to build the broadest possible base.\n\nShe will not repeat the mistakes of her father. Never again will Russia crumble from the errors of a few.\n\nShe stumbles, almost trips and falls. Panic echoes through the Congress, and guards stand to help her up. She waves them off - a leader always stands up before her people, she thinks - and resumes reading. A police officer, one of the few good ones, she thinks, and she's finished at last. Polite applause comes as her speech ends. She staggers out of the podium, stumbles into her seat and takes a long, long swing of the devil's brew.\n\nShe barely has time to let it down her throat when the first rejection comes. The unionist is a good choice, yes, but according to the remarks he made to a speech in so-and-so factory, his allegiances to independent unionism are rather in doubt. And as for his own capacities to build the Revolution, has the Chairwoman not noticed his work with so-and-so employers?\n\nBukharina stares blearily into the Congress, head unbowed.

Her parents had died young, and all she'd known as she grew to adulthood was this: fluorescent lighting, endless queues of machinery and the quiet sorrow of being alive.\n\nBut Kollontai's words kept her going. There was a fire in them, an inexpressible celebration, that let Marianna know who she really was: in her words, for the first time in what had been an otherwise utterly unnoticed life, she felt heard. When her supervisor ignored her pleas for paid overtime, when her colleagues snickered at her slower pace and tentative moves, when she was tired, abandoned and so alone it hurt -\n\nShe would run to her hiding place, flip to the page, so well-browsed it was fastened to the spine by sheer willpower, and read the words, "Certainly not the woman worker. She is her own savior. Her future is in her own hands." She read it over and over and over again. Occasionally tears would slip out and dry on the smoothed, weathered paper, like little blossoms. Then she would return to her workplace, her pain seemingly cast aside.\n\nWhen the Soviet Representative came to the factory, she was ready. Scarcely had the words Marxist Feminism flowed from the Representative's mouths when she rose to speak, talking almost too fast for comprehension. She spoke of the need of her fellow workers to fight alongside her, not undercut her position, and as she spoke she almost wept with the relief.\n\nIn the silence that followed, she packed her things with trembling hands left the factory.

Let us consider the following:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we argue that women are NO MORE physically incapable than are men! Women are rarely seen in manual labor because they have NOT been given the chance to work outside the home; indeed, raising a home with little support from a husband can be oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we reply that women are, far from hysterical, the more composed sex. Was Hitler not a male? It was under the charge of MALE leaders, not female, that the world was swept in war and horror; and it was under the Bourgeois Dictatorship of the Intellect that the world LEARNED to associate Maleness with Wisdom, and Femaleness with Chaos. This is oppression in itself!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we retort that the same traditions that give Russia its 'values' have led it into error, again and again! Because Russia loved the Tsar, it SLAVERED before his gaze and expected reprieve from the First War, and was shocked when the Tsar answered their begging with BULLETS. Because Russia loved tradition, it hesitated when the clarion call came to build itself up with the rest of the World, and for it, we were CRUSHED as Hitler's savages came for us. Our infatuation with tradition will lead us to embrace only the GRAVE!\n\nComrades!

Let us consider:\n\nTO THE FIRST, we respond that the so-called 'PRESERVATION' of Russia's Church led to its near defeat in the Great War, and has done nothing for us since the release of the SERFS! Religion is an OPIATE of the masses, and our duty as class-conscious workers is to WAKE the masses from their drugged slumber. For that is worth any amount of forfeited 'blessings'!\n\nTO THE SECOND, we demand a retraction of this INSULT to our workers. Our Workers' Battalions are imbued with the most HUMANE of class values, and would gladly give their lives for the defense of the INNOCENT. They attack only the hidden predators of the working class, who ABSCOND with the wealth of the masses in the name of religion! Those who are not enemies of the workers have nothing to fear!\n\nTO THE THIRD, we call only for a demonstration of the so-called VALUES these Churches preserve! Do the accumulated wealth and power accrued by the PRIESTS not indicate that, far from being our moral guardians, the Church has in fact acted as our collective RACKETEERS? Let us be AWARE, comrades!

The reactionary apparatus HYPNOTIZES innocent women into SELF-VICTIMHOOD - that is precisely why they struggle with us when we RIP the illusions from their faces! Let us ceaselessly destroy their illusions - when they come to their senses, they will THANK us.\n\nTO THE SECOND, we are UTTERLY CONTEMPTUOUS of the idea that these so-called "swinging Socialists" would ever be pure enough for the REVOLUTION in the First Place. Our creed calls for the SELF-CRITICISM of every aspect of their reactionary lives, and yet it is the removal of some SENSELESS VEILS that destroys the fabric of their communities!

Piece by piece I was drawn with you - drawn by you, rather - into a web of lies, deceit, layer upon layer of hidden truths, and I accepted it because I wanted so desperately to believe in what you said. The Special Section of the Directorate, the Mission - you said Bukharina needed people to defend her, that the Left needed nightwatchmen, to protect it from the monsters in the night. Even as I began to see more than just money in the invoices I signed in my name for you, I believed in what you said.\n\nI see now that the only menace Bukharina needed protection from was your merry band. How could I possibly have ignored the invoices to Suslov? And as you smiled at me and promised that your alliance was nothing but a red herring, were you really thinking of me? Of us?\n\nKnow this, Anton Aronovich Pachikov. I stared into your eyes, so deep and rich like endless golden fields, as the red banners fluttered around us, and you promised never to leave me. I wish I had never swept into your arms. I wish I had never known you at all. And I cannot, no matter how painful it is to remember you, cast you aside. I will ask you one last time.\n\nAre you truly a Suslovite mole? Did what we shared mean nothing to you? Please, tell me. I will never see you again. The least you can do, for someone who loves you so and loves you still, is a single honest word."

 bukharina.17.d:0 "The chairman of the Commission had seemed like an odd choice at first glance. Why had Bukharina chosen such an innocuous young woman, with little experience and even less credentials within the Party, to lead the work? The Chairwoman was seldom accused of political interference, but there were outright rumours of corruption swirling around the woman from the start; the choice was so unexpected, it was hard to believe it had not been planned.\n\nWhen the Commission's first meeting kicked off, however, all doubts were dispelled. The woman, introduced only as Comrade Misha, outlined an agenda so ambitious and detailed it could only have come from a consummate political operative. In days she pushed through a proposal outlining radical changes to women-specific wage rate laws and housing specifications, and within weeks it was on the floor of the Congress of the Soviets.\n\nMisha brought the Commission to vibrant action in other ways, too: it was quickly discovered that her connections to industry players had bought them all a window into the closed spaces of the business world. A dinner meeting became a formal invitation, and then spiraled into a full-blown conference complete with research initiatives. It was a dream come true for the Committee's members: it seemed that the sky was the limit with this mysterious young woman.\n\nAlthough most never thought to question the Committee Head, one member was not so naive. As Misha was packing her things in the meeting room one evening, the Party Operative approached her and whispered that she knew who Misha was - or at least who she had worked with. Industry access. Windows to all the spheres of government. Secret projects that appeared and disappeared at will. Only one ghost remained this influential in the Republic.\n\nMisha chuckled, and whispered to her: "Suslov is dead. I, however, am very much alive." Then she was gone, leaving only a scattering of notes in her wake."

He stiffened, nodded. "Well then, let's get this evening underway." He nodded again, ever the gentleman, and gestured for her to get in. Bukharina chuckled a little to herself - here she was, the most powerful person in the Republic, being taken for a drive.\n\nWell, she couldn't complain too much. It was the Workers' Liberation Day, after all.\n\nThere were fireworks illuminating the town banners as the station-wagon plodded its way into the Central District of Sykvytkar. Bukharina could only wince: poor old Karby would have his feathers scared stiff, if he didn't outright die of shock.\n\nMedvedev simply sighed. "A man of my age, dragged around in a glorified trolley. What would my wife say about all this?" As Bukharina chuckled, he went on. "You know, Svetlana, I never thought we'd get this far. Those early days in the Assembly, when we were just note-passers talking over teatime and gossiping - who'd ever have thought it?"\n\nThe iron in her voice must have surprised him, which was slightly disappointing in itself. "I've always thought it, Roy. Never stopped believing in it. It was inevitable - all we had to do was work for it, no matter the cost. No matter the price." She looked out at the swarms of workers heading to the celebration. "You've always been loyal, for which I thank you. But loyalty isn't enough if you want to build the future."\n\nThe station-wagon pulled up to the packed stadium, and the tunes of The Sacred War blared through the windows. Bukharina smiled, almost conspiratorial, and opened the door for him. "You also have to fight, Roy," she called, but the fireworks blotted out the sound, and she couldn't be sure Medvedev heard it at all."

Bukharina was evidently a woman of similar tastes: gazing around the spartan confines of the cafe, if it could be called that, Yuri admitted that it was exactly as proletarian as he'd imagined the Chairwoman would like.\n\nSvetlana looked up from her plate, shooting a quizzical gaze. "Enjoying the food? I suppose we could have chosen a better establishment."\n\nYuri shrugged. "Truth be told, Madame Bukharina, it's all the same to me. I don't care much for affairs of the palate these days." The conversation trailed off, stillborn, and for a long while the two ate in silence.\n\nBukharina pushed her plate away. "I've noticed the Directorate's latest reports on loyalty in rank-and-file unions. Very well written, I'd have struggled to do better myself." Yuri tilted his head a little in acknowledgement, but said nothing.\n\nThe Chairwoman raised her cup to her lips, so what she said next could be heard clear in the echo. "Are there similar concerns with the leadership of the Directorate?" The glint on the cup was unnaturally bright. Yuri put the flash of light before him and the open window about two meters away together and chuckled to himself. The kid was growing fangs.\n\n"I do not believe so, Chairwoman." Of course, now the game was up the pistol in her handbag seemed almost gauche. But it was a good effort from an amateur. Perhaps she would have made as good an operative as she was a politician.\n\n"My apologies, Chairwoman. I must leave for business. Enjoy your meal." Yuri leaned close and whispered: "And get your sniper to blur his scope a little, it was painfully obvious. Even so, a good effort, yes?"

"In fact, I believed I've given a speech at your employer's headquarters - regarding the necessity of a perpetual revolutionary mindset in the promotion of employees. Were you in attendance?" The bashful unionist nods, and Bukharina flashes one of her brighter smiles.\n\n"Then I believe you know my stance on the matter of workplace hierarchies. Thank you very much for your work, Comrade." She pats her on the shoulder and moves to the next one. A member of the River-Fishermen Association, she believes - their long-chaotic state of logistics has put them in close association with the Congress, and she gets his name on sight. "Ah, Yerik!" A pause, he widens his eyes, and Bukharina moves in for the kill. "Such a pleasure to see you again. I hope the assistance we've granted your workingmen has proven of use..."\n\nYerik chuckles. "Yes, it's been something of a struggle. I suppose you're no better off, Chairwoman Bukharina. This - " He gestures at the crowd arraigned around them, a gauntlet of eager faces and good cheer. "This must be all very daunting for you, yes?"\n\nBukharina looks confused for a moment, but she's never been one to lose composure. "Ah, pardon me. I was taken quite by surprise at your question - but to answer it, no, this is like breathing to me. Unconscious, I suppose - perhaps I just like slacking off." She chuckles, and subconsciously checks her timing. God, has that put her off schedule? There's a meeting in the evening, and Medvedev will kill her if she's out of sorts."My apologies, I really must be going now. I wish you the best of luck with your resolution process!"\n\nAs Bukharina turns to leave, Yerik calls out, "Try not to collapse with the energy, Madame Chairwoman!"

"This machine has been sent to your town by direct order of the Agrarian Advancement Council - approved by the Chairwoman herself." He spoke the last clause with near-reverence. Grigori's already low assessment of the man plummeted still further. He hated blind worshippers of things - God, the Republic, this Chairwoman character (had he even voted for her?), and most of all the metal machines that now raked his neighbours' fields.\n\nGod, how he hated them! Not that he believed in God, but the intensity seemed only fitting. The Bocharovs and their gas-guzzling abomination - he'd been grilling something in his yard when the stench hit, and the cutlet had never recovered. He'd never give in to their monstrosities!\n\nThe Unionist, hearing all this, shrugged sagaciously. "My orders are simply to pass this to you, Mister Grigori. What you choose to do with it is your own business." With that he walked away, and Grigori sighed as he began the mental calculus of fitting this within an already crowded homestead.\n\nThe next morning, he rose to find a flat canvas in his backyard and a distant whirring.

They're silent for awhile before the Great Belt and the sky, unbounded and brilliant. A view like this could swallow the entirety of one's mind.\n\nKristina breaks the silence. "I didn't hear about your school today, Sacha." He's off to that technical school these days, although she isn't quite sure what that means. "What are you learning these days? Are they going through History again?"\n\nSacha shakes his head, reluctant. Perhaps it's teenage bravado or rebelliousness. Kristina hardly minds, but she'd like a straight answer - she nudges Dmitry, who rouses himself as from a slumber. "Yes, Sacha, are you doing well for History these days?" In response to her mild frown, Dmitry only shrugs. A father can only do so much.\n\n"I'm not taking history this semester. We're doing machine-work."\n\nThe parents' eyebrows rise in unison. Machine work, so far out in the farmlands? Has the Republic finally gone mad? "That's nice to hear, Sacha. What are they making you do?"\n\nHis initial answer is drowned out by little Timofey's burbling, and Sacha fusses over the child as he continues. "We do - it's hard to describe. Pressers, I guess? They press metal into sheets. We do work on a central lathe, that's what it's called - we drill holes and cut the metal into shapes. They'll fit in everything from tractors to planes, or that's what Teacher says."\n\nDmitry nods. "That's good, son. If you can work one of those machines, maybe you'll help repair the combines we use someday. Then you can use that as an excuse to be sweet on the Kalinka girl from across the street, yes?"

Nevertheless, he checked the loophole on the door... and recoiled.\n\nA stern-looking man of the Directorate of Revolutionary Preservation stood on the wooden step up, escorted by two more officers carrying ominous black briefcases, and an armored personnel carrier which idled on the dirt road outside of his house. He wanted to run, right then and there, but the door was the only entrance to his modest home, and it was locked down tightly by the no-doubt armed officers. Were they here for him? Had they learned about the alcohol relabelling? He swallowed, nervously, and looked to his left, where the two children, Ivan and Katya, were washing the pots. He thought about calling out to them, but couldn't. If this new Directorate were anything like the Okhrana that had been active here since mere years ago... with nerveless fingers, he pulled the latch. The door swung open, and he retreated as far as he could against the wall.\n\nThe first officer crossed the threshold, carrying something concealed in his long coat. Katya jumped and hid behind her brother. His head swiveled towards Vasily, and he gestured, bringing three more people inside. Vasily's eyes widened in shock.\n\nChairwoman Svetlana Bukharina stepped into his humble home, with a hand on her black brimmed hat. In one hand, she held a book. In the other... Ivan cried out and dropped the pan that he was carrying at the pistol in her hand. She did not waste a moment, placing the book on the table as the URS officers stacked their cases next to it.\n\n"Comrades!", she recited, as if she had done it a thousand times before. "I am here to liquidate you!"\n\nAnother cry from Katya was quickly cut off by the lead URS man, who opened his case. The children were just too far away, separated from him by four well-armed people. Vasily braced himself for the cruel sound of the gunshots, closing his eyes."

The other officers, and the Chairwoman, stood next to the table, reaching into the black cases. At a glance, he noticed that the pistols were gone, replaced by books and writing utensils.\n\nHe took the book from the officer, gingerly, before trying to flatten himself against the wall even more. It was useless to him, but perhaps obeying could get him out unharassed, without the unexpected quartet looking under the floorboards. Bukharina placed her book on the table, smiling to the children, before speaking.\n\n"I apologize for the unexpected visit, comrades," she begun, before presenting a piece of paper with some illegible text on it. "This village has been marked as the next stop for the liquidation of rural illiteracy. Has the local council informed you of your local liquidation point?"\n\nThe children tentatively inched towards the door. Vasily blinked once, uncomprehending. Did that mean- this was all an overly-threatening entrance for what he understood as a political reading group? The seeds of a chuckle escaped his mouth, to be strangled in a moment by anxiety. Sensing that compliance was the way out, he let himself begin to form words.\n\n"I- No. No, Comrade Chairwoman.", he said.\n\nBukharina nodded, slightly.\n\n"Your locality has assembled a center in the back room of the town hall. My sincere apologies for the lack of notification. I am honored to welcome you to attend in person."\n\nAs they began to pass out books to the children, all Vasily could do was nod politely, and take one himself.

While Leonid was as guilty as any prankster his age, he at least knew to act innocent when the class was looking. No, something had to be going on.\n\nHe whispered it to his little clique during lunch, for at their age it was almost taboo to ever confess a great fear to the Adults. Gazing around with all the grizzled intensity of a hardened conspiracist, he admitted: "I think there's something going on in our school.

If anything, we're getting dumber for every day we attend it." Vadim nodded, ever the follower. But Leonid was insistent, as with all young prophets.\n\n"No, you're not getting it. Think about it: when was the last time you got a test back?" Silence around the table. "Exactly. We keep changing our lesson formats, too. When we were suddenly speaking up in class a lot, six months ago, Old Ms Adrianna called for us to sit still and keep quiet. Then Ms. Sakharova told us that, you know, we should try this new drawing-thing? Charts?"\n\nVadim piped up. "Yes! I loved that part! Shame they switched right back to reading. I hate long words."

Svetlana Bukharina was for the most part at ease in the Chairwoman's coat, but it was never a perfect fit, and often an uncomfortable one. At moments of stress, doubt or fear she withdrew to her home and the comfort of Karby, where the voices and the endless expectant gazes could be dispelled for at least a few hours.\n\nNow she gazed upon the preening bird, her eyes unfocused and dull, her mind elsewhere altogether. She was, in her mind's eye, leaving through the brief history of her interactions with Suslov. An impromptu alliance here, a common resolution there. In truth, the two had never shared much in common despite their common cause, and the days when they had fought under the same banner seemed increasingly distant. A mirage through a telescope of time.\n\nWith some effort she wrested her attention to the present, and the letter awaiting her. She had no real desire to open it, because she knew how it read. The inevitable had come to pass. On the envelope was marked the words, SUSLOV - CONTINGENCY PLAN: VERMILLION RAT. In it were details of the operation that would remove her greatest remaining political opponent in the Republic. She'd been in the briefing herself: this last letter was merely a formality. All it would take was a stamp and a signature, and the paralysis of the Left in the Republic would come to an end.\n\nSo why did her hands tremble so as she thought? No, she felt no real remorse: she knew what had to be done. It felt...wrong, like cutting the last strings to one's anchor. And, in truth, Suslov was nothing without his supporters. Would a little mercy be too much to spare? Karby shrieked, and Bukharina rushed to soothe her feathers.

If the choice was positive, Andropov would add it to the large pile on the left: if not, to the small, neat and alphabetically arranged stack on the left. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAndropov had once made the mistake of talking to a priest about his line of work; the latter had mumbled something about the sheep and the goats, and then he'd retreated. Well, even without having read the Good Book Andropov knew what he was on about. His job was essentially that of a judge: the good and the bad, the assets and the liabilities. The quick and the dead.\n\nAnd there had been so very many of the latter in recent days, Yuri mused. For some reason Headquarters was sending over requests at a vastly increased rate, even compared to the early days of the Revolution. They were lucky that the Directorate had recently gotten a wave of new recruits. This stack had been the result of what he estimated to be three months' worth of labor. Otherwise...well, no Revolutionary state had survived the collapse of its security apparatus.\n\nA staffer poked his head out the side of the door, yelling: "Director Andropov! There's a fresh stack of work for you down the hall!"\n\nAndropov stretched his sore back, hiding a wry smile.

No matter what the radio says in the coming days or weeks, I know the Muslim community here. We have always had faith in God to preserve us - you know that we are not violent people. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.\n\nWhat we believe may soon be irrelevant, however. Already the Government has issued another of their foul Revolutionary Directives to begin 'investigations' into the death, and the neighbours of the flat I am staying in have been questioned several times in the last week.

Away from the prying eyes of society, from the police who would persecute them, and their families, who would rather let them starve. The two savored each other's presence for as long as they could -- these clandestine meetings would have to come to an end, one way or another.\n\nAs they parted ways, both dreamed of a world where they would be free to love each other, where they did not have to fear for their lives.

 bukharina.46.d:0 "Bukharina walked along the riverbank, appreciating her surroundings. The Irtysh was a surprisingly pretty river, and the city of Omsk had a certain beauty to it. It was nice to have a short period of time where she could breathe and reorient herself. In a way, wasn't that what she was doing with Russia? A calm, a reorganizing of efforts before pushing to the Pacific?\n\nShe chuckled, shaking her head. This was supposed to be a time where she didn't think about politics. She brushed those thoughts aside and continued onwards, allowing the cool breeze to blow on her. She took off her hat, feeling the wind flow through her hair. It felt nice, as she never was able to spend much time outside. It was almost as if the winds of change were blowing in her favor.\n\nShe had so much more left to do. The people of West Siberia had suffered greatly, and would have to be assisted by her government. There were so many social reforms she'd have to implement, as well. She nee- no. Her reforms would come soon, but she had to set her goals aside for now. After all, it was such a gorgeous day outside. Who was she to waste it?"

 bukharina.47.t:0 "Bukharina's Reforms"
 bukharina.47.d:0 "With our recent gains of territory, Bukharina has seen it prudent to implement some social reforms. These social reforms, at their core, are a package of laws meant to ensure that all people within the [NIK.GetName] are seen and treated as equals. Not only will we ensure protections for racial minorities, but also for women as well. After all, as a modern socialist country, we cannot allow over half of our population to be deprived of the rights they deserve. There will undoubtedly be controversy, as people will try to push off these reforms until Russia is 'more stable', but to wait would be nothing but a betrayal to the socialist ideal."

 bukharina.48.d:0 "Dimitri entered Bukharina's office, curious. While he had meetings with Bukharina as he was the head of her guard, they weren't normally this late at night. He took a seat.\n\n"Dimitri, can I try to explain a concept to you?" He nodded. "Imagine if you will, if children were raised communally. While their parents would play a role in their upbringing, said upbringing would be collective, involving the entire community. This would prevent the parents from passing on bad traditions to their children, while also ensuring that the children get a well-rounded childhood. This would also mean that the family, as it exists now, would be phased out if this was the nationwide standard. Does that make sense to you?"\n\nDimitri mused it over. He understood the concept, and could see how it would be executed. "Yes, it makes sense to me. However, I can imagine that there would be those opposed to such an idea, along with the possible negative consequences. Of course, you probably invited me here to bounce ideas for handling that off of?"\n\nBukharina chuckled. "You know me too well, Dimitri. Let's get to work then, shall we?""

Oh god, what if he said no? What if he hat-\n\n"Ok." Sofia looked at Alexander, shocked. Would it really be that easy? "I know my family has had a very...dim view on women, especially wives, working, and that I trust them on a lot of things, but I can tell how much you want to be a teacher. Your passion for it is...very evident." He smiled.\n\n"I love you, Sofia. You've supported me through so much. I'll always do the same for you." Alexander hugged her. Sofia felt her eyes tear up as she hugged him back. No matter what, she'd have her partner there to support her as an equal."

 bukharina.50.d:0 "Ivan listened to the radio, surprised. He had heard from one of his friends that the government would be making an announcement tonight. While being a part of the local Soviet took up his time, it was his duty to ensure he was always up to date on governmental affairs.What he had heard shocked him.\n\nDevolution of power to the regional Soviets? Did this truly mean that the Soviets would have more control of local affairs finally? It was surreal to Ivan, who had seen the central government as the sole controller of power. He felt inspired. Maybe now was his chance to carve out a name for himself? He'd be sure to remain loyal to socialism, of course. Ivan had no plans to get into trouble now of all times, especially when change seemed on the horizons. He grabbed a piece of paper and a pen. Best to start writing down his ideas now, if this was truly the new reality of Russia."

 bukharina.51.t:0 "The Future Beckons"
 bukharina.51.d:0 "Bukharina sat on the park bench, enjoying the cool breeze. She had done a lot of work over the past few months, and it had been a long time since she was able to take a proper break. Not since her walk in Omsk had she been able to relax properly. Her mind wandered, for once freed of political concerns. However, her thoughts, after a time, would inevitably drift back to politics.\n\nBukharina was content. Her reforms had borne fruit, and it seemed the [NIK.GetName] was stronger than ever. Man and woman stood as equals, and those of a different race were not oppressed anymore. Unlike so many other socialists, she had worked to ensure that these rights weren't in name only. Bukharina could only hope it was a good start for fighting for equality.\n\nNow, with West Siberia stabilized and the foundations of a new Soviet Union forged, the time was approaching to unite all of Russia under one banner. Finally, the chaos that had plagued Russia for decades would be ended. However, that could wait for one more day. It was a beautiful day outside, and Bukharina would be remiss to let it go to waste."

Triumphant joy filled the chamber, filled with beaming officials and applauding military officers.\n\n"But we will not follow in the footsteps of Comrade Bukharin, for he lacked in one critical aspect; the ability to define the ambitious goals necessary to carry Mother Russia forwards!

 zhdanov.2.t:0 "An Unsettled Peace"
 zhdanov.2.d:0 "The first real indications that Zhdanov has no intention of structuring his Socialism along democratic lines are the widespread repeal of the Revolutionary Decrees, announced in public along a dozen channels. Radios are switched on, through the Republic's environs, and their volume turned all the way up as horrified ears take it all in.\n\nIt would probably have been easier to accept if the new regime offered concessions or promised a transition to a more permanent and just public order. Zhdanov, of course, promises with his trademark cheer that soon the citizens will return to a normality that favours the Republic as a whole.\n\nThe initial protests are unsettlingly loud and unnervingly close. Stations are barricaded or simply refuse to open, as do shophouses and public institutions. NKVD officers stationed in the district find themselves overwhelmed by the popular pressure, and a number of covert agents are nearly discovered and lynched by sheer force of popular anger. As it turns out, the broken clock of public anger does, in fact, strike twice a day.\n\nThis unnerves the Agency. New plans are created in the dead of night, and networks once thought solid melt and coalesce in new configurations, like a shifting cloud forming around a dense maze. At the heart of this cloud are a group of seemingly random individuals. They will be the first test of the new Republic's socialist science.\n\nOn a Monday morning, as the not-protests roll into their fifth day, individuals begin to disappear from the protests, and when they return they speak as if they had never doubted the Republic - when they speak at all. The confusion they spread instead poisons the protests, rumors of internal disorder and violence stain its reputation, and by Wednesday order has returned, albeit in a less-than-satisfactory form."

 zhdanov.3.t:0 "A Fait Accompli"
 zhdanov.3.d:0 "Andrei Zhdanov was a smart man, and the first thing you learned about being smart in the old Komi Republic was that you could never afford to show yourself as such. The Left was a den of people who believed they were smarter than they were, or worse, acted like it - that was why Zhdanov had seized control and his competitors had not. The key was not to act smart - it was to have the people at your back. Better yet - to have the right people have your back.\n\nAnd so when Zhdanov called the impromptu Party meeting he focused not on speechwriting, but on table arrangements. Like a dollmaker playing very elaborate house games, he moved certain positions close to him, and the names of those who were less than enthusiastic about Ultravisionary Socialism a little away, and in his mind he constructed a careful model of applause, built and timed just right to give the illusion of omnipresence.\n\nBy the time the Party Congress was formally in session, it had already been rigged to hell - but no one noticed, of course.\n\nWhen the Party Secretary declared the merger of the offices of General Secretary and Premier, it seemed like a tidal wave of applause swept the room, and confused delegates rose to give applause to what seemed like the People's Will. Delegates carefully planted in key positions on the perimeter clapped louder than the rest - the loudspeakers packed under each table amplified that effect. As Zhdanov accepted the laurels of Paramount Leader with grace, not a single question was raised.\n\nAnd so, without ever lifting a finger in immodesty, Zhdanov stole the Congress, the Party, and the Federation - and from that moment, the march of Soviet History was attuned to an altogether different beat."

With our economy churning at a full, rational speed under a cybernetic and computational core, the fascist basketcase of the German economy can be revealed as the pacing dog it is.

In an amazingly measured tone, Shepilov thumbed through the weighty file now on Zhdanov's desk, jumping from talks of telephonic networks to obscure policies in 20s Siberia to variables in economic simulation. Once the breathless birth of the future coming from Shepilov's mouth ended, Zhdanov bolted upwards and gave him a kiss on each cheek.\n\n"Beautiful, beautiful. A fully automated and scientifically planned economy, free of any nefarious influences or chaotic inputs from men. Sheer Russian industriousness mixed with Marxism, with, with...with robotics! Yes, robotics! Ahh, Shepilov.

We can build a strong Soviet Federation with no markets, with no returning to old bullshit from the past, no failed Bukharinism. No, we are here to win, and this five year plan will not only create a booming industrial sector to churn out war and civilian material, but will run off of machines! Machines that can take every input to make the most rational decisions, and provide for us all!

Finished with his attendance taking, Zhdanov began his promises and hopes. "So, I expect all of you to build a functional, human-guided space shuttle within six months." The figures in front of Zhdanov stiffened immediately, then a few turned sheet white when he finished by saying, "failure means execution by firing squad. Begin."\n\nOnce his terror had done its work, Zhdanov guffawed. "Who do you think I am? A Nazi? You are all heroes who will be treated as such. Caviar and champagne awaits tonight. You will each continue the beautiful work you've been doing in your own institutions before, except now you will have the collective purpose of popular work. By the end of your tenures, we will have thoroughly conquered both the mind and the stars!"

"With these latest tools in the sowing of the Earth, our output can be greater than ever! If we are to build the Ultravisionary Socialism promised by Comrade Zhdanov, if we are to be permanently rid of capitalism and the Nazi yoke that protects it, we must understand our role in the five-year plan! To feed all of the Federation, we must use these tools, the plows and tractors, to reach our mandated quotas.

These would range from simple things such as advanced rifles, to more advanced weapons such as laser weapons that could destroy incoming missiles from miles away.\n\nKolya had been to many of these meetings, he knew the procedure quite well. However today was an unusual day. Instead of the regular procedure of a meeting and then the sharing of ideas, they focused on the ideas of militarization. He himself saw many of these ideas as science fiction, ideas that only stood in books. However, as he learned more and more from the men who had spoken at the meeting, he saw that it was much more closer to reality than fiction. Ideas had been brought up to the men, such as the ideas of high altitude bombers that could strike enemies from altitudes only dreamt of. These ideas had floated around the men, as they worked harder and harder to one up another. More ideas had been considered such as powerful tanks that could withstand nearly all of the firepower in the German arsenal. While many of these ideas could be seen as nearly fiction to the many people of West Russia, it was nothing more than a possibility for the dreamers of the People's Commissariat of Science."

It would be to prepare a new society, one that is socialist and combines the ideas of the visionary ideals that many of the scientists in the Commissariat hold.\n\nA small outline had been produced and made by the scientists, with a large focus on making the country more advanced using more modern ideas instead of the older, more focused ideas that had been made in the eve of the Russian Revolution. The goal of their new mission was to figure out a way for their society to become one that will be a model for all socialist countries. Ideas ranged from the idea of a united culture that would surround all socialist countries and would inspire many of them. However first, they would need to select what they would research first. Would they reach for the idea that they would need to research deep into the ideas of technology that would connect them such as satellites and high tech radio? Or would they delve deeper into fields such as sociology where they would learn how to truly influence people and make sure the society that they envisioned would be the best one for the people that would live in the society. Whatever focus they choose to look at first, it would be the one that would be important to the future of the socialist cause for visionaries everywhere."

While many of them had fought in the war, some of them hadn't, and had been more focused on operating in the East during the conflict.\n\n"As many of us know too well, we had been too brash in our attacks, coming into Moscow with an incredible speed. While these tactics are seen as acceptable in some places, it truly led to our downfall" He stopped for a split section and watched the room, before motioning to an assistant to change the projector screen, it then showed a map of the Russian advance. Varennikov then pulled out a presentation pointer and tapped it against the border regions of Moscow. "While our first attacks had been good, they soon descended into a slow moving slaughter. We had caught the Germans off-guard. They thought that we had been dead for good, however as they learned over the next few months, it couldn't have been more wrong. They will certainly be expecting us to arrive to their doorstep in the coming years so we must learn from our mistakes"\n\nVarennikov motioned to the assistant once again, who had seemed to fall asleep. He poked the assistant with the pointer, who then shot up awake and changed the slide. It then showed a picture of Hans Spiedal, the man who had stopped the war.\n\n"This man right here, he is the architect of our downfall. If we must win against him, we must prepare.

 zhdanov.13.d:0 "The meeting had been early in the morning, with many of the men drinking coffee. Some of them preferred to be drinking a more heavy substance, one that would wake them up and prepare them for a day of discussing the next generations of warfare that they would develop and the armies would take place in. Many subjects had been brought up so far, such as the development of bombers that could strike from miles in the air and hit targets countries away.\n\nHowever, one of the more polarizing topics that had been brought up was the development of lasers. Lasers had been a personal interest of many of the scientists who had been assigned to work on the projects. However, they soon remembered that they had to focus on only the next generation and not fifty years now. Many of them shared the same ideas. The warfare in the coming decade would mostly be shaped as similar to the combat that many of them had seen so far. One that was fought and won with fast moving vehicles and a very mobile infantry. Some scientists had more outlying ideas that soon garnered more interest. One idea was proposed that the next generation of war would be completely fought with air combat. Land would be seen as irrelevant unless the helicopters or planes had been dropping off soldiers for a fast-strike mission, such as a raid. While the idea had certainly been seen as laughable at first, it soon garnered more attention as some of the men had begun to agree with it after thinking over the idea a few times. While certainly controversial, it was an opinion that could possibly work in due time. As the men filed out the building to continue their research, they wondered if it was truly possible at the end of the day."

 zhdanov.14.t:0 "Warfare of the Next Century"
 zhdanov.14.d:0 "Like the meeting the scientists had recently, it was another one focused on warfare of a certain generation. However, instead of focusing on the next decade that many of them would possibly be alive for, they now focused on 2070. The year was picked due to it being a whole century later, one that would be very focused on really seeing on how much the scientists could think of. As the scientists fired into the room, they saw the assignment that they needed to do, so they began to get to work.\n\nUnlike the previous discussion, many of the men did not go into camps to discuss their ideas. The whole exercise was one that was seen as a radical decision. It was one hundred years later, certainly something that none of the men would be alive for. Maybe some of their great grandchildren, but not them. Many of them had differing ideas, but many stuck to one or two ideas by the end of the day. The first idea being that the warfare in 2070 would be largely focused around the internal mind of soldiers, with them fighting in an environment that would be largely based upon the basis of "neuro-warfare" a concept that would be developed in the next century as a way to both train soldiers and as a tool for battle. The second idea was one that the wars of tomorrow would be fought with huge towering machines. Ones that would carry armaments that would destroy the armies of today within hours. While they would be extremely expensive, even a country having one would be a massive detriment from any attacks on them. Like the last meeting, when the time was up, the men filed out. However unlike the last one, many had felt much more inspired by this one, thinking that if it was truly possible to have our minds do the battle for us or even giant machines to fight."

 zhdanov.15.d:0 "Zhdanov had been presented with two options in front of him when he had been given a folder. Inside were two profiles. He knew why these had been dropped off to him. In the coming days he had to decide a manufacturer that would produce all of the weapons that the Soviet Federation would use to take back Moscow. However he still needed to pick.\n\nOne of the options was a group that had been relatively unknown, known as Goran Arms. The company itself had been around for about ten years, and had produced weapons of good quality. They had been known for being on time, but with weapons that had been seen as basic to the times. On the other hand was the G.A. Korobov, a famous visionary that had made his name known with his weapon designs. While he had yet to put out a design, he had found favor with the many visionaries that found themselves home in the federation.\n\nAs Zhdanov read over the two profiles, it came soon apparent that he would need to choose. While he quite liked the companies both, he liked the visionary nature of Korobov. However he liked that Goran had produced weapons before that had been well received."

Some had taken unbelievably daring journeys over German lines to get there. Emma's story was significantly less impressive; she flew in from New York after some time as a student radical. She shared an apartment in the capital with a few other foreigners, and when the "Embassy of the Global Proletariat" was announced she was among the first to sign up.\n\nThe building was an old meeting hall, chosen for its scale, with different nations' delegations arranged in a great circle, and Emma decided to tour them before joining her comrades in the American section. First came the Soviet section, robustly populated with a number of local officials. Then came the British section, an eclectic collection of elderly resistance fighters and trade unionists. The German delegation piqued her interest. "Comrades, you must have suffered greatly under fascism. How did you escape?"\n\nThe man she was addressing looked confused before replying in what was unmistakably a local accent, "Ah, I see the confusion. In the absence of German representatives, we are portraying the German proletariat in their stead."\n\nStrolling the aisles from Hungary's, to Iran's, to, most bizarrely of all, the "oppressed African peoples'" delegations, Emma found that the case was the same. Without the global proletariat actually present, the Soviets had taken to casting Russians in their roles and instructing them to imagine what the people of those nations might support. While she appreciated the enthusiasm, perhaps it may have been better to leave this particular project on the drawing board."

It is no secret that your Government has long abandoned all reason and moderation - and that no amount of human blood and tears are sufficient to deny them what they deem to be theirs. For this reason, this letter is being written in Syktyvkar instead of Moscow, so long the heart of Russia - for this reason, millions suffer in the groans of an oppression so horrific it is almost unbelievable.\n\nFor this reason, while millions burned in East Europe, you defiled the surface of the Moon - an innocent celestial body which had done you no harm - with a flag steeped in the remains of those who have wanted nothing more than to resist you.\n\nWe understand, too, that your Masters wish to bend history, and have deluded themselves into believing they can control the future of the world by simply willing it into being with rifles and tanks. To this we have nothing to say, except the obligatory words of the sane to the madman: good luck! May you soon be disabused of this idea, and may its loss hurt you bitterly.\n\nBut we will make no bones about our own desires: what was stolen from the Workers of Russia, the Russian People cry out day and night to regain. The boots you use to stamp upon our people from old Kiev to old Leningrad will be consumed in fire as you are held aloft, the yoke turned inside out and twisted into a stabbing dagger. We will stop at nothing until our people are free.\n\nAnd on behalf of that part of the world that still calls itself free, we cordially invite you to take down the offending flags - and the armies that held them aloft - and leave at once, for Germania your home. Take them down from Moscow, Petrograd, Paris, the Moon - they are only tainted by the shadow of your bloody banner - and take the endless cycle of horror you bring with you."

I am grateful for the kind words the assembled delegates have issued me, regarding the beauty of the city around us - and indeed I am proud of what the Soviet workers have accomplished here. Not for the stunning architecture or natural beauty, mind you, although we do possess plenty of those once you get past the suburbs. (Laughter.)\n\nNo, comrades, what I am speaking about is the beauty of Proletarian Unity. Now, I am sure many of us would laugh at that last statement, and who can blame you? The history of socialism, in Russia as everywhere else, is steeped in the tears of betrayal and mutual recrimination. Were one to ask a worker in the streets of your average urban city anywhere around the world, he would call the Communist one who was more dedicated to fighting his contemporaries than his enemies! (Laughter, commotion.)\n\nThat disunity cost us dearly when our enemies came for us, as we had foretold so clearly. Indeed, we are the Cassandras of history: always warning of the catastrophes awaiting the Capitalist world and on guard against Fascism, and yet never able to protect ourselves from our predictions. Our squabbling kept us from mounting an effective resistance, here in Russia, and around the world the smoke of failed revolutions wafted countries even further into chaos than they had been at the start.\n\nNo more, comrades! We face the most fearsome and final enemy, right at the doors of Russia and around the world, and yet we have nowhere left to retreat! It is internationalism or collapse, united socialism or barbarism - life or death!

 zhdanov.35.d:0 "Andrei Zhdanov sometimes found the smiling, genial Socialist he'd once been almost alien, a thorough stranger compared to the man he was now. As the Federation had grown in complexity and size, so too had his administrative functions, until it seemed like half his job was scheduling meetings for the right people to meet each other and get things done for him.\n\nThe other half, however...Zhdanov smiled. The other half of his job made it all worth it.\n\nThe old dream he'd hidden was coming into view, in gluts of weekly reports from the scientists. The limits of the human mind were being stretched into new shapes and patterns; even where his ideas had failed, they had given so much information in the bargain that he couldn't say they'd been failures at all. Soon the New Socialist Man would rise like Titans from the deep, super-men ready to rebuild the shattered nation and bring Proletarian humanity to where they'd always dreamt of going: the stars.\n\nAnd the machines on which they would ride were coming into being, too - as the Testing Initiatives grew ever more expansive, their tests blossomed into fruition, too. Forget about the military applications, he'd always told the Generals. The wonder is enough. And the wonder Zhdanov experienced as he read about the test flights he couldn't watch personally was like - a man watching the summer stars, dreaming of taking flight. Yes, like a scene in a dream.\n\nNodding quietly, Zhdanov rummaged around his study and began a new series of scribblings in a well-worn leather notebook. Frowning, he scrapped the first draft he'd drawn and began a new one. This one was far more complex than the first; notes to self-referential articles abounded, and with them actual scientific reports, but in the centre were three clear and outlined words, circled repeatedly as with a child's drawing."

The Bukharinists and the Red Juntas fumbled half-blind in the search for progress, and the Fascists and Monarchists and Bourgeois Pseudo-Democracies stumbled fully-blind into their error. We know that our course is true; our people are our benchmark and the Science of Marxism our guide. "\n\n"But a man looking towards the Stars will never be content with the things of Earth alone. We speak often of re-engineering the Economy, of building a fairer and better way of life for all through the scientific control of goods production. We also speak of rebuilding Society, of tearing down the walls between man and woman, between worker and politician, that separate us from each other. But to do this alone is not sufficient."\n\n"I now believe, comrades, that we must re-engineer the human heart itself - that just as the patient farmer, year after year, nudges his crops to greater fecundity, we, too, can create a bumper harvest in the Soviet youth and the generations after them. We know that the Marxist Dialectic dictates the struggle in the mind; we know how to condition these struggles to tilt one way or the other, so that the future of the Soviet mass-consciousness leans evermore towards greater unity."\n\n"This is our future, comrades; not a world consumed by the struggle against fascist reactionism or fear of its inevitability - a world where the very thought of it is impossible.""

 zhdanov.37.d:0 "Excerpts from the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, Second Edition (1967)\n\nTHE ZHDANOV SOLUTION. The realisation that Ultravisionary Socialism is destined to spread throughout the universe, as determined by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov's intense study of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Originally promulgated as a solution to the Fermi Paradox of Italian-American physicist Enrico Fermi, which observes the apparent contradiction between the lack of evidence of extraterrestrial life and the immense likelihood of its existence, Paramount Leader Zhdanov discovered that the most likely block to the advancement of extraterrestrial life to the interplanetary and intersolar stages of development was the persistence of backward stages of development (feudalism, capitalism, fascism) on alien worlds.\n\nWith the immortal science of Ultravisonary Socialism only existing on Earth, brought to us by the unique genius of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, only Earth holds the possibility of rising to a higher stage of interplanetary, intersolar, and perhaps even intergalactic development. It is thus the duty of the Soviet Federation, as one true embodiment of Ultravisionary Socialism, to spread itself first across the Earth, and then to alien worlds suffering under the oppression of primitive barbarism.\n\nTHE INTERSOLAR SOVIET FEDERATION. A future space-faring intersolar civilization founded on the principles of Ultravisionary Socialism, as vaticinated by Paramount Leader Andrei Zhdanov. Starting on Earth, the Intersolar Soviet Federation will spread from planet to planet, liberating alien species from the oppression of feudalism, capitalism, and fascism. Its armed forces, the Intersolar Red Armada, will obliterate all enemies in its path, assisting extraterrestrial workers and peasants in their struggle against their oppressors. It will educate the alien workers in the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Zhdanov, and ingrain in them a deep understanding of the immortal science of Ultravisionary Socialism. Ultimately, the Intersolar Soviet Federation is destined to expand throughout the universe, ushering in a final, Universal Soviet Federation, and an eternal aeon of universal peace, prosperity, and liberty."

 zhdanov.39.d:0 "Junior Sergeant Volkov enjoyed his job. The NKVD paid well, the hours were good, and his tasks were usually fairly routine and easy. He also enjoyed the human element. Volkov was a reserved, private person, with no family and very few friends. Listening in on people for the NKVD gave him a sense of connection to people he felt he would otherwise never have, even if they were total strangers.\n\nSome he even grew attached to. One old man, a retired violinist, routinely played his instrument in his small apartment on the third floor of the complex. He was of little interest in terms of scientific observation, yet Volkov still listened in almost every day, and came to love and depend on the old man's little personal recitals. When the old man finally died, Volkov felt the loss deeply. He even broke protocol and attended the old man's funeral from a distance, leaving flowers at his grave after his family and friends had departed.\n\nAnother subject Volkov grew close to was a florist who lived in one of the second floor apartments. He grew to love the sound of her voice, on the phone to her mother, or drinking with a friend, or just talking to her flowers, which she treated with great care and fondness. Volkov wrote down her every idle move, the notes then fed back to the scientists for analysis. Yet one day, while hosting a party at her house, Volkov caught her disparaging Paramount Leader Zhdanov, calling him a "unhinged lunatic." Volkov felt great mental anguish over this incident.\n\nOf course, he ultimately turned her in. While their directive was merely to observe and document cultural and social shifts in the population, they were also duty-bound to report anti-ultravisionary behaviour and speech. She would do a short stint at a reeducation camp, and be back in no time. Yet when she returned, she was much changed. She no longer talked to her plants, or to anybody for that matter, not her mother or her friends. Volkov grew worried, and then bored. After a few days of silence, he moved on to find a new subject."

Abraam and Artem Alikhanian, Oleg Firsov, Yulii Khariton, and Yakov Zeldovich, all brilliant physicists or former members of the Soviet Union's aborted atomic bomb project during the early stage of the Great Patriotic War. Cherkasov felt almost an impostor sitting in the same room as these men, despite his own credentials and experience as a researcher.\n\nThe mood was tense, and there was little talk amongst the physicists as they waited. They all knew what this gathering meant. Zhdanov wanted the bomb, and they were the men who had been chosen to build it for him. The idea filled Cherkasov with a mix of excitement and dread. Participating in a project of this importance would be a lifetime opportunity for Cherkasov, but the prospect of what the Paramount Leader of the Soviet Federation would do when he finally got the bomb terrified him.\n\nJust as this thought crossed his mind, the man himself entered the room. Dressed in an all-white tunic and suit, sporting his characteristic thin moustache, Cherkasov could not help but feel that Zhdanov looked ridiculous. Yet as the Paramount Leader climbed the steps to the stage before them, Cherkasov clapped as emphatically as all the other men of science and reason. Reaching his podium, Zhdanov called for the crowd to quiet before he began to speak.\n\n"Comrades, I will be quick and to the point. I have gathered you all here today to address an issue which is of fundamental importance to the Soviet Federation. As you all know, the diabolical Nazi thugs across to our west posess a nuclear arsenal capable of destroying us at a moments notice. If we are ever to defeat the Hitlerite dogs, the Soviet workers must be armed with a nuclear arsenal of their own, a workers bomb to blow the Germans away! That is your mission. Working together, with all the resources of our great Soviet motherland made available to you, you must with great haste and energy construct the workers bomb. Comrades, you are being entrusted with the fate of Ultravisionary Socialism. Do not fail me."\n\nCherkasov and the other bomb makers rose, clapped, and shouted:"

His family, his hometown, his friends - all gone. Only thing left was his work. With the refuge caravan he got to the Sverdlovsk, where he got employed in a local research facility. Years passed, Yaroslav got fired for secretly spending facility's money on a personal telescope, and after that he mostly survived by either doing manual tasks for pennies or teaching basics of astronomy in rural schools. Until he got a letter. It randomly appeared in his mailbox one day. After reading it Yaroslav froze for a second. It was an invitation to work for the government. Letter had a detailed list of Yaroslav's pre-war achievements, some of them were forgotten by Yaroslav himself. He quickly departed to the facility, as he had nothing left to lose if he agrees, not to mention the rumors he heard about scientists who refuse to cooperate with the government in a Soviet Federation...After all procedures Yaroslav was sitting in his new office, trying to estimate how much money were spent on this new facility. Just the equipment in astronomical department probably costed like the entire building of the facility he previously worked in,not to mention everything else.

I want you to build a rocket, put a man in it, and take socialism to the rest of the universe. Of course, you'll be provided with as much funds as you need.

He began to move, barely ever touching the ground with his feet. Bound by silent bound he covered the space to the main lobby, where he'd heard the adults gather. His eyes grew wide as he approached the window. The harsh industrial lights were on, and he heard urgent talking from beyond the glass pane.

Two weeks from the last 'retrieval' and you must take another child? What on earth are you doing to them?" The Master's voice had something...different to it. It sounded reedy, almost pained.

Taboritsky did so, standing tall and proud before the golden throne crafted in secret for this very day. Only the archbishop stood between him and absolute power - and now, that man stepped aside.\n\nTaboritsky stepped forwards, and took up the crown jewels: a scepter for his right hand, and an orb in his left, both fashioned of gold and of his own design. He would never assume the imperial crown, but all present would know his absolute power from appearances alone. He turned and sat himself upon the throne of regency, and all before him knelt in sublime submission."

The commoners lowered their eyes as they passed the watchmen, never daring to challenge their icy gaze.\n\nWhen men worked, they did so without idle chatter or the relaxed movements of the content. They were rigid, nervous, mechanical. There was no longer room for mistakes. A dropped box, a broken tool, a word out of line - all were inadmissible errors, remedied with the guilty man's sudden disappearance and replacement by somebody more deserving of his role.\n\nDissent was a forgotten word. Not even the bravest dared to ask uninvited questions, or whisper grim secrets to their families in the dead of night. The Okhrana had made it known that anybody, from the lowliest worker to the nobility, was safe from a knock on the door and a five-minute trial ending before a blood-spattered wall.\n\nAs the Regent looked down upon his city from the balcony of his palace, his heart was at last tranquil. This incarnation of the Empire was not a decrepit old man, bloated with decay; it was a single, glorious machine. A firm hand on the levers, a gentle turning of the dial, and it would move as he willed. As the tale of history unfolded according to God's design, so too did the cogs of Russia by the Regent's hand."

He was gripping the pocket pistol concealed in his jacket so tightly that the edges were biting into his palm. Taboritsky rose from behind his desk, a smile on his face. It wasn't reflected in his eyes - there, Pyotr could only see a deep well of madness on the verge of brimming over. "Pyotr," said Taboritsky, taking up a pair of filled vodka glasses as he approached. His graceful, measured movements belied the simmering insanity that Pyotr knew to be within him. "Won't you join me for a drink?"\n\nA transparent ploy. Pyotr didn't let his eye contact with Taboritsky drop. He shook his head, too anxious to answer.\n\nTaboritsky's smile vanished, replaced with the stone-faced, dead-eyed stare Pyotr had seen in his nightmares. It was the same look that had graced his features when they dispatched Nabokov; the same as when he had first ordered chemical weapons unleashed. Yet, maybe... "Eminence," Pyotr began, forcing himself to relax slightly. "I have-"\n\nEverything happened at once. Pyotr instinctively jerked backwards as he saw the glasses drop to shatter on the polished floorboards. Taboritsky seemed to leap forwards, the glint of polished steel in his right hand. Pyotr let out a reflexive shout of alarm and tried to draw the pistol from within his jacket pocket - only for it to tumble, with a clatter and a bang, to the floor. All he could do was throw his arms outwards towards Taboritsky, catching his knife arm at the wrist.\n\nBoth men were old, creaking relics of a Russia past, but Pyotr was the weaker. Not even a second later, he felt something give in his elbows, and the knife drew closer. In that instant, what little courage had driven him evaporated, replaced only by gibbering, insensate terror for his life. "Sergey, Sergey, Sergey!" he screamed at the top of his lungs. "Sergey, stop! Stop! Sergey, please! Just list... Listen to me, Sergey!"\n\nDespite his plea, no hint of mercy appeared in his friend's eyes. The gleaming point drew closer, spurred on by a madman's strength. Pyotr gritted his teeth, eyes bulging as he tried to find some final reserve of strength in his old bones - and then, he slipped. Something cold slid between Pyotr's ribs. He fell, first against the wall and then to the floor. As his vision tightened to a tunnel, the last thing he ever saw was the steadily spreading pool of his lifeblood edging towards his old friend's trembling boots."

 komi_burgsys.5.d:0 "A poor showing, Taboritsky thought as he closed the comprehensive report on the Regency's finances. Poor indeed. Western Russia was one of the most resource-rich areas in Europe, but this was all his esteemed Treasurer could scrounge up? A paltry few billion in taxation? Had the people been utterly deprived by the Bolsheviks for the benefit of the Jews, or were they themselves hiding something? Both, he supposed; the former could easily have led to the latter.\n\nThe Regent rose and meandered over to the window of his study, a glass of Breton wine in hand. From there, he could see smoke rising from chimneys on the skyline. Beneath, he knew that there were thousands of strong Russians working day and night to forge the arms of victory - but it seemed those same workers were holding out on him. The Soviet Union had been a worker's state, had it not? Surely their loyalty was questionable at best.\n\nTaboritsky returned to his desk and set the glass aside, before producing a sheet of paper to begin drafting a memorandum to the Imperial Treasury. What they had now wasn't enough. All within the realm was rightfully Tsarevich Alexei's property; therefore, in his absence, it was the Regent's. The sovereign would have what he required, no matter how jealously it might be guarded."

"Besides, it's just a dress uniform. If we're ever wearing it in summer, it'll only be for a parade or whatever."\n\nThe newly-minted corporal wasn't so sure about all this. Two years in the Eurasianist militia, and this was where it led? To a strange hybrid of an SS and Tsarist uniform that barely fit him, four more years of mandatory service and the prospect of fighting for a leader that he didn't even support? He had joined up with Gumilyov precisely because he was a republican and a believer in something new, but here he was in the service of a Nazi and a monarchist.\n\n"I hate this already, sir," he confessed as he tried, once more, to pull his undersize boots on. "Why didn't we just follow Gumilyov's lead and run? Fuck, I remember when we used to fight Taboritsky's boys, and you're really okay with just forgetting those days?"\n\n"I'm a patriot and a believer," responded Polnikov curtly. "If the man in charge is Russian and a man of God, then I'll fight for him. I respect Gumilyov, but he was never going to give Russia what it needed."\n\nAt the back of the room, behind a row of lockers, Private Medvedev finished jotting down the corporal's words and made for the nearest telephone.

It was for that precise reason that he had received the Regent's sacred trust, and now stood before a row of fresh Okhrana recruits - his recruits - awaiting their first assignments.\n\nHe stepped forward and handed a small slip of paper to the first man in line.

Thinking quickly, Esfir clicked off the tape recorder and slipped it into the pocket of her dressing gown, before gently opening the couple's door.\n\n"It's just me, Mommy," she said, her face concealed in the darkness of the hallway.

Similarly, someone had hung a framed photograph of him above the mayor's desk.\n\nThat same afternoon, a truck rolled into town with armed men sitting in the flatbed. As they climbed down and took up positions, the driver stood up on the cab and held aloft both a megaphone and a portrait of the Regent.

Once, you all welcomed the faces of treason and atheism into your homes; repent, and hang high the visage of your rightful sovereign!"\n\nNobody moved a muscle. Instead, the villagers simply milled around, confused and slightly nervous. One of the guards racked the bolt on his AK, and the driver spoke again.

The two men who had organized them were gone, and there were six armed guards in the factory.

Anatoly disregarded the warning to work at his usual pace, humming all the while. At the end of the day, with only a third of his quota met, he was dragged outside and beaten shot through the head by one of the guards, along with the two men who had worked alongside him.

In the abyss of time in which he and the other slaves resided, there was only the banging of picks on the walls, the rattling of minecarts filled with coal being pushed uphill, and the coughing of men with lungs full of coal-dust.

The floor was now marble, and every piece of wood was carved and decorated. Rich purple rugs were laid out at the base of the grand staircase in the atrium. And, of course, nigh-on everything was decorated with gold leaf. Stripped from undeserving subjects, Jews, banks and heretical churches, it now adorned bannisters, tables, chairs, desks, hearths and virtually anything else that might catch one's eye.\n\nIt was the full splendor of Imperial Russia, reborn at the expense of subhumans and traitors. There could be no more fitting a tribute to the Regent who had made it all possible."

It was always a pleasure to speak with such a bright young boy.\n\n"Mr. Markov, sir, I have a question about the Bible."\n\nThe teacher folded his hands together on his desk. "Well, Father Kirill might know more about that than me. I only know what I was taught myself at your age. Still, I'll try to give you a good answer."\n\nNikolai looked altogether too curious. "Mr. Markov, if the Bible says: 'Thou shalt not kill', why do the soldiers do it all the time?"\n\nMarkov blanched and took a moment to compose himself. "Nikolai, ah... that's a difficult question, not to mention a little unfair, don't you think?"\n\nHe shook his head. "No, Mr. Markov. I saw a soldier shoot old Mr. Androv from down the street yesterday. I know soldiers kill people in wars, but he wasn't in a war, he was just an old man who liked old, um... party music, he called it."\n\nMarkov paused, then placed a hand on Nikolai's shoulder. "Nikolai Mikhailovich, the truth is that there are some questions you shouldn't ask. It's a good thing you only asked me, because-"\n\n"Oh, I asked the soldier outside the school too, but he didn't answer me, just looked at me funny and asked my name. I told him, but he still didn't want to tell me."\n\nMarkov's heart sank, and he patted Nikolai on the head before dismissing the boy.

There were both men and women, most of the middle-aged or older. They were dressed well - fellow intellectuals, maybe?\n\n"Hey, what's going on?" he asked nobody in particular. "Where are we going?"\n\n"Where do you think?" asked an elderly woman, peering down at him through half-moon spectacles. She was sporting a nasty bruise on her forehead, and had a split lip. Nestor noticed that one of the lenses in her glasses was missing.\n\n"We're all teachers," said a younger man sitting just next to him. "Which means you must be too. We're all from the same school, but I don't recognize you."\n\nNestor's heart sank as the pieces began to come together.

He could taste a chemical tinge on his tongue, and knew that the mask wasn't on correctly.\n\nSomeone stumbled out of the gas cloud and collided with him from his left, sending them both into the mud.

His fellow soldier hauled himself upright and pressed on without stopping, every footstep accompanied with the sucking of mud under his boots - but Oleg was choking.\n\nThe gas pressed in from all sides. His lungs burned from even the little he had inhaled before holding his breath, and his eyes were stinging and watery.

He thought the salute had a certain pleasing aesthetic quality to it. His arm dropped as the last officers on foot finished their passage.\n\nHopefully, he found himself thinking, they would prove more competent than the generation of their grandfathers. Those damned White Army snakes... save for a few brilliant minds like Denikin and Kornilov, they had been incompetents and traitors to a man. If the arrogant fool Kolchak hadn't been so obsessed with his image, if he had actually recognized the true threat and rallied around the cross...\n\nShaking his head and blinking away the lights of the skein that had begun to appear, Taboritsky raised his arm again as the cavalry officers approached. Dressed in black, traditional-style uniforms with just a hint of SS influence and the crested helms of 19th-century cuirassiers, they cut daring figures indeed. They wouldn't look quite as impressive in tankers' uniforms, but the Regent dismissed that fact and allowed himself a moment to luxuriate in the sight. This was what he hoped to leave the Tsarevich once he was found: men who were brave, loyal and true, not to mention traditionalists to the bone.

Their goose-stepping boots beat out a steady tattoo on the cobblestones, like the war-drums of Heaven. Individual men disappeared under the vast carpet of shiny black helmets, their identities subsumed into a single terrifying whole. Many onlookers found themselves cheering despite their trepidation, swept up by the sublime display of power before them.\n\nIn the soldiers' wake came the vehicles: trucks, half-tracks, IFVs and tanks, the finest that the Imperial Army could field.

"That's the lot, I think," he said, lighting up a smoke of his own. "Always difficult with the men sourced from border towns.

They'll fuck anything with two legs. Sometimes more, I hear!" The pair shared a chuckle, before Kamarov stubbed out his cigarette and rose to his feet again.

Close inspection revealed that gums were bleeding, and skin appeared to be actively dissolving at a slow rate.

Lesser men rarely have the willpower to do what must be done. That task falls to great men of destiny like Adolf Hitler - and myself, I suppose. Even now, I am more than aware of what my supposed benefactor, the two-faced Lev Nikolayevich, says about me from the safety of exile. He calls me a mere Nazi esoteric, deriding me for crushing his iconoclastic vision of 'Eurasia'.\n\nTruthfully, I harbor no resentment towards such men. God would not have sent them to my aid if they were truly evil. Besides, is forgiveness not among the highest of virtues? Perhaps someday, my fellows in Syktyvkar's rightist bloc will return and find their place in the grand design. I shall ask Saint Ephraim the Syrian to intercede on their behalf and show them the true path to salvation. God willing, they will come to understand in time."

And all the people cried and said: God save the king." - 1 Samuel 10:24\n\nThe reorganization of Holy Russia's framework continues apace. Steady progress, no hesitation, no doubling back, lest we lose sight of the path. One expected more difficulties than one has thus far encountered. After all, OVRI did not enjoy the same luxuries that Hitler did when the time came to assume power. We had no gullible civilian government that could be swayed to our side, nor did we have the full confidence of a large, revanchist military.\n\nThe greatest resistance has been from the same expected source: the Reds, who continue to assail us despite their defeat. It seems that they have learned some valuable lessons in obstinacy from their verminous masters. No matter how hard one stomps down the boot and grinds them under heel, they somehow manage to return, time and again, to torment Russia.\n\nThis persistence is most concerning. The process of reorganization is only going to intensify with the passage of time, and the regency cannot afford continued assaults on its subjects. The Imperial Army must increase its efforts and smoke out the Jew-atheists before they can multiply in number."

 komi_clockworks.6.d:0 ""A wise heart shall acquire knowledge: and the ear of the wise seeketh instruction." - Proverbs 18:15\n\nDoes the soul reside within the clay of the body, or is there some means by which an immaterial spirit might interface with flesh? Science has dug deep into the physical nature of humanity, but no answers yet present themselves. When I resided in Berlin, I heard tell of many developments in psychology and the philosophy of mind, but - there's the rub. But. There was always a but - the developments were theoretical, or speculative, or devised by a Jew. I suspect the latter is the case throughout the world of academia.\n\nFor my part, I would theorize that the question of soul-mind-body interaction is to remain forever unsolved. I have my own idea - that the brain contains some kind of lattice that serves as a conduit for the soul's energies - but I can never prove or disprove it. Like those esteemed academics, I can only ponder. The difference between us, of course, is that I would never enter such a passive, layabout profession.\n\nMen of letters and wisdom are necessary, but... troublesome. The whispers of Zionist propaganda echo loudly in the halls of learning. Was it not from academia that Bolshevism first sprang, rather than the proletariat? I worry for the future of Russia's youth should we fail to root out the rot before rebuilding our academic tradition."

 komi_clockworks.7.d:0 ""Thou are spent with foolish labour, both thou and this people that is with thee: the business is above thy strength, thou alone canst not bear it." - Exodus 18:18\n\nCan the working man ever truly be liberated from Bolshevism? It seems that there is something about his nature that makes him inherently vulnerable to its charms. Even in the so-called 'social democratic' system, he always agitates for more. More money, more free time, more benefits. He is never satisfied so long as he possesses a democratic voice.\n\nThere are two solutions to this problem of the working man's greed. The first is to place him in charge of the state - to accept Bolshevik rule. Obviously this is preposterous, not to mention utterly unthinkable to any good Russian. The second is to do precisely the opposite of what he desires; to crush his autonomy, to diminish his wages, to take away his 'rights'. This second solution would appear counterintuitive at first, but has enjoyed great success in Germany.\n\nWhy is this? I suspect it is because the working man has rebellion in his blood. Perhaps this is a trait inherited from peasant ancestry? That would explain why rebellions in recent centuries have usually emerged from below rather than from the nobility. Regardless, it is clear that to truly liberate the working man's spirit, he must be broken and forced to bow to his betters. If he cannot see any means of ascending beyond his appointed station, his ambition will be curtailed. Applied on a grand scale, perhaps submissiveness can be bred back into the lower classes, so that the Bolsheviks might never again find an audience amongst the commoners."

The doubters, those fork-tongued deceivers, have grown in number. They think, now, to betray me. They think that I am ignorant of what happens in the dark corners of taverns, in their homes, in the deep woods. Confronted with their misdeeds, they say: "Your Eminence, you are mistaken. We are, all of us, loyal and pious men. Your word is law, and we shall not disobey."\n\nIt saddens me deeply to see men I once thought honorable and trustworthy led astray. Even in victory, one feels defeated. How am I to carry out my task when even those sent to aid me are seduced by the Prince of Lies? Is this, too, some manner of test? Am I\n\nYES. Damnation, but I have been a blind fool. How could I ever have thought otherwise? The Lord tests us constantly, does he not? Is that not His right, as creator of all? Do we, sinful and weak-spirited mortals, deserve anything less than constant scrutiny? Of course not. God watches us, always judging, always testing our faith. Perhaps this is a sign - one that I have been too blind to see. But no longer. I will ensure there is nothing beyond my sight, nothing beyond my knowledge.

My own people - the pure race - see the degeneracy and profligacy of the West, and think it virtuous. They look at bourgeois Americans and see a 'liberated' and 'prosperous' people. How can they be so blind? How can they fail to see the golden strings upon which the Elders of Zion make them dance?\n\nAnd then they talk of social mobility! The very thing which sparked the downfall of the Empire! Was it not with promises of rising to power that the Bolsheviks seduced the workers? Was it not to the nascent middle class that the backstabber Kerensky appealed?\n\nEveryone has their place. It has been that way for thousands of years, long before Russia ever united. The Jews' constant attempts to break down the fabric of society, to force the lambs to lie down with the lions, has ALWAYS been their primary means of undermining civilization. Am I the only man in all Creation who understands that? Even the Germans, virtuous as they are, have the order of their nation in disarray! Where is their Kaiser, their nobility?

How long have we fought against the people who plague us? A thousand years? Two thousand? Before the Russians came to the true faith and founded Kievan Rus', did we wage war unending upon the people of the steppes, the Udmurts, the Komi and the Finns?\n\nWe must have. War is the means by which the strong thrive and proliferate further. The Russians are not mere survivors! We are conquerors, champions, paragons of civilization! It is for that purpose that we have no need of sly trickery, the likes of which Jews employ. We have never had to win a war by turning one foe against another. Not once has Russia been defeated by conventional means; the Germans faced only our red doppelganger, and we would have crushed the Japanese in 1911 if Anglo-Jewish interests had not subverted our glorious navy!\n\nWe can't let it happen again. We came so close to total destruction during the civil war. If God had not favored me, I never would have survived the accursed Republic's intrigues alone. We need to be stronger - much stronger. We have to match the Germans, at the very least, but even that may not be enough. Jewish subterfuge grows more complex by the day.

Zionists might never have become a nuisance if that had been the case. One admits, it is a pleasant thought - history without Jews, a world ruled only by those appointed by God, or at least by the deserving.\n\nBut it is a fool's hope to wish for money to be abolished. It has become humanity's hereditary curse, as inextricably tied to our existence as original sin. One simply has to bear it and pray for deliverance. But, that aside, the sheer obsession of so many in Russia with money is abhorrent. Everything is about cost, about budgeting, about affordability. And the economics! One has had quite enough of those self-proclaimed 'experts' telling one what to do.\n\nWe are Russia! We don't need Swiss watches or American cars to sustain ourselves! We don't need to make ourselves dependent on lesser nations to succeed - why, one wonders, does anyone even suggest such a thing? Do they think nothing of consequences? The moment we engage with international Jewish finance, they will have their claws in us again!

It is much quietened now. The new servants are much more agreeable, less inclined to idle chatter - and, more importantly, less inclined to idle hands. It felt as though every pair of hands besides one's own was idle before now, and every man knows that the Devil has a multitude of uses for such things.\n\nReplacement of the previous palatial staff was not as easy as one hoped. They had been trained well, utterly inured to pain. But the Shturmoviki were trained better! One hoped - no, KNEW that one of them would break eventually. No amount of Jewish brainwashing can render one immune to the lash of divine truth.\n\nSo, now they plague Russia no longer. Our blessed Tsarevich will never need to fear unfaithful servants with the lessons that his Regent has imparted today. The natural order has been disrupted for so long that one is inclined to forget that servants are a class unto themselves. They have an alarming tendency towards laxity and corruption when spared the whip for too long. Sometimes, as recently, the gangrenous presence of treason goes unnoticed and sets in.

No longer shall we, as godly men with the fire of faith and tradition in our hearts, allow our wives, sisters and daughters to prostitute themselves in the streets, or spread their legs for subhuman beasts!\n\nThe Lord thus commanded the Israelites: "The woman that shall lie under any beast, shall be killed together with the same: their blood be upon them."

Sweat ran down his face in streams, darkening the blood-crusted and ink-stained paper. His eyes were bloodshot and weepy; he had not slept in days. He no longer sat at his desk - it was too near the window, where God could peer down from the Heavens to look upon him with shame. Instead, he was curled up in a corner, back aching, feverishly scribbling. He stared straight ahead, hands moving on their own. He hadn't written anything resembling a word in a week.\n\nThere was a sound, a scuffling of boots on marble. The Regent glanced up, and felt his heart freeze. His pen clattered to the floor. He tried to stand, but his legs were like lead, and he stumbled to his knees. As he dragged himself forwards, he felt the strength begin to drain from his arms. A pounding began to thrum in his head, a pain like no other - but he pressed forth.\n\nFor how could any man not be enraptured in the presence of his Tsar?\n\nHis dark hair was cropped short beneath the golden crown. He wore a cape of ermine, and was bedecked in gold and jewels. He looked older than the Regent had expected, but shone with the light of Heaven, an immortal sovereign for the Holy Russian Empire. Taboritsky opened his mouth to speak, to question, to marvel - but the words would not come to him. The divine grace of his monarch was overpowering, paralyzing his entire body. Every muscle had turned to stone. He blinked - and finally uttered a scream.\n\nBones. A small skull with a bullet-hole in it. Scraps of fine royal clothing stained with old blood were laid over them. The scream turned to a choking gurgle as the pain exploded inside his head, blacking out his senses. He collapsed, staring in horror into the darkness around him.\n\nAnd Sergey Taboritsky, Blessed Regent of Holy Russia, breathed his last."

He felt a mild pang of disappointment; it seemed that Tsarevich Alexei had deigned only to send a pair of angels in his stead. Quickly dismissing such selfish emotions, the Regent raised his hands and spoke again: "Greetings, servants of the Lord. I humbly ask that you infuse my soul with light, that I might see through the shadows that bar my way."\n\nThe whispers grew louder. Though Taboritsky could not comprehend the language, somehow he still understood their meaning. "Yes," he muttered, sweat dripping down his forehead despite the cold.

The sun's light shone upon the altar, dazzling him with golden radiance.\n\nSuddenly, he gasped. There were no whispers, but he had definitely just felt a pair of strong hands grasp his shoulders. Firm and masculine, they definitely belonged to a stronger sort of heavenly servant. "O servant of the Lord," he said, voice quavering with emotion, "I seek greater knowledge of my sovereign. Tell me: does he reside within the Regency's demesne?"\n\nSomething prodded Taboritsky's mind, and he understood. Against the protests of his feeble flesh, he opened his eyes wide and stared into the blinding light reflected off the altar.

"Oh, Blessed Virgin, you honor me beyond measure! Please, tell me: where is Tsarevich Alexei?

Within its folds and creases, he saw such knowledge as had been forgotten aeons prior. His eyes rolled back into his head, unable to bear the torrent of wisdom that poured into his mind, and he blacked out.\n\nWhen Taboritsky came to, he was lying on his back, drenched in sweat. As he opened his eyes, he saw that the world was bathed in a beautiful, yet eerie magenta light. It seemed to permeate all around him; when he stood and looked down at his hands, he saw that his skin was black, and his veins had turned to gold. He blinked in shock - and suddenly, everything had returned to normal. His mind ran over with lost knowledge, dizzying him. Grasping the altar to avoid falling over again, Taboritsky exhaled and wiped the sweat from his brow, utterly overwhelmed. He would need time to process what God had just bestowed upon him."

Who were the Workers, anyway? What scientific method could be used to delineate the proletarian from the oppressor, the innovative from the parasitic - the good from the damned? And what did it mean to give these Proletarians, if that was indeed their true name, the means of production? Would the committees be run by the elite, who after all were used to power, or to unsteady newbies whose enthusiasm far outstripped their experience?\n\nNot to mention the matter of who the Enemy was, of course. Oh, everyone knew there was an Enemy: the propaganda rang true, and the paranoia was fresh and bright as the smell of blood in the winter snow. They lurked behind every doorway, their subtle strings tugging at the Russian heart, angling innocents into complacency, parasitism. Sin.\n\nThe question remained, unanswered and unanswerable, a dagger at the heart of Serov's movement. Who was the Enemy? And if they were a class in a classless society, both of which the Marxists were adamant about, how could one ever tell an Enemy from a friend?\n\nIn the end it simply wasn't worth the trouble, fighting over a deafening void and a slowly collapsing loyalty to a silent leader. The Passionaryy elements seemed to fall away all at once from the base Serov used to pummel legislation through the Assembly, as if some invisible chain had been lifted, and it was clear that something fundamental had changed in the Republic.\n\nLike most divorces, it was quiet at the end.

He had spoken of a future with land, bread and solidarity for all, and unlike the others he seemed to believe in the peace he spoke of. It was all catnip for Lavov, who'd hated the sight of guns since his father perished in the fall of the Union. The errant rabble who called themselves the Left hadn't been any more convincing than the drooling reactionaries they opposed on this point: all and sundry seemed determined to march into the sunset, toting a gun on one hand and their enemies' skulls on the other.\n\nOnly General Secretary Serov had promised true peace, true unity. And Lavov knew, with all the quiet absolution of a true believer, that Serov would deliver.\n\nAnd he had, hadn't he? The People's Provisions Package was blared on every loudspeaker in the country, inviting the true sons of Russian soil to take what was owed them. Minimum wage, healthcare benefits, even what they called Unionists without Unions - all could be claimed with the verification of citizenship.

Precious little time could be afforded for the frivolity of mass gatherings, certainly not in the present circumstances. But some things were unavoidable, and important enough for the Party to address - so a working holiday was declared and the various Congresses and the Workers' Councils convened.\n\nSerov gazed at them. Talent, certainly, but unpolished. Blunt and dull, like steel that had been left in dank air too long - edgeless. It would take work to weave them all into a knife worth wielding, and if he wanted to succeed, he would have to start now.\n\nHe asked the simple question, left it hanging in the air like a noose, an invitation. "Does anyone know what their superiors have done this last month? Their subordinates?"\n\nInto the deafening void that followed it, he began to drill the principle of mutual knowledge - over and over, just like he'd been taught by the Academy - into their heads. Simple, repetitive motion. It was almost like the conditioning techniques his commanders had speculated about using. This time, however, there would be no time for trial runs.\n\nSerov began his next move. Raising a piece of paper, he began to read names: the loud, the outspoken, the complainers and the whiners and the fearful. They were, he said, welcome to leave - but should they stay, they would be honed into something better. Something greater. Demotions, of course, would follow, even revolutionary criticism.

The old Soviet Union had been too weak, too divided. The old Soviet Union sacrificed so much, for so little gain. Serov and his government would remedy these mistakes, and the new Soviet Union would emerge from the ashes stronger than ever before.\n\nOne of the greatest weaknesses of the old Soviet Union was its federalized structure. The bureaucracy became bloated, and local governments were given far too much autonomy. One only has to look at what Kaganovich did with Western Siberia to see why that was a mistake. Serov's new Soviet Union would be unitary in structure. Local governments would be a mere stepping stone between the people and the capital, and all major decisions would go through the central administration first. The unitary structure proved its efficacy in World War II, with the strong, united Japanese and Germans defeating the fractured Americans. The same unitary structure would be applied to any formerly autonomous administrations, as giving the minorities their own identity merely weakened the Union's cohesion.\n\nThe Soviet Union was a Russian invention, and yet Bukharin sacrificed so much to try and please the other peoples within its borders. The Ukrainians, Belarusians, the Baltics, and the Turks, they did not answer directly to the capital, and therefore did not identify truly with Moscow. In the end, their loyalty failed us when it mattered most, and proves that they can't be trusted with the same freedoms Bukharin afforded them.

It was a game, Serov thought, a high-stakes game for the future itself. And the time had come to pick his allies.\n\nThe old cults of Taboritsky, Shafarevich and Gumilyov lurked in his base still. He knew, staring at those politely clapping for the latest speaker, that they could never be trusted with the will of the people - they barely trusted him at the best of times. He was always dancing on eggshells, hiding his real beliefs under a constantly shifting series of dogwhistles and promises of "right unity". Where had that gotten him?

It would join the others in the bin soon enough - damn the Passionaryy and their "internal discipline" habits! Hadn't it been enough that he'd enthusiastically dogwhistled to their basest, most irritatingly capitalist desires to gain a seat at the table? Now his hands were tied and his mouth was stoppered, just at the moment when his triumph was supposed to be full and complete.\n\nWell, at least this treatise on the 'Rights Of The Sovereign Nation' was complete. What an incoherent jumble of ultra-nationalistic sentiment it was! But it had been the only way to make the idea acceptable to both his conscience and the appetites of the Passionaryy. Moving to the 'Internal Enemies' section, however...that was promising in a way mere centralism had never been.\n\nYes, if there was one thing Serov knew best in his long years of serving the Republican Left, it was the rooting out of enemies - and the many ways one developed of finding them.

The only thing the latter had optimised, Sergei thought bitterly, had been his unwillingness to spend more than was absolutely necessary on lunch-rations.\n\nWhatever this new Factory Control Measure was, he didn't like it either. Welding was a serious business - his friends could get hurt by the inhuman standards the Quotas were dictating. He made a mental note to speak to the Overseers the State had appointed; at least the one assigned to his Factory seemed friendly enough.\n\nAs the work-day dragged to its close, Sergei slipped off the assembly line on a 'smoke-break' to find the Overseer.

"Yes, comrade, the General Secretary is fully aware of this - our efforts, I mean. But we must all work together now, for the resistance against the Degenerate Capitalists-"\n\nAgain a voice interrupted him, this time from the far end. "Ain't we already gotten rid of the Capitalists? I'd like to have a cuppa with the GenSec himself, seein' how he's wastin our time 'ere - maybe he'll sponsor me for the privilege!" This time the laughter came in bursts, and it was unrelenting.\n\n"Comrades!" Sacha snapped into the mike. "You are not listening to anything I have said.

The Five Year Plan would be revolutionary, and ensure that Serov's men were well-equipped and prepared for war.\n\nThe Five Year Plan was focused on heavy industry, and military production. Among the major goals of this economic plan were the creation of industry safely distanced from any possible combat fronts, funneling more and more resources into producing tanks and armaments, and raise the annual industrial growth to levels unheard of elsewhere in RUssia. All of this military production would of course cause a heavy fall in consumer goods production, but true citizens of the Soviet Union will take this temporary sacrifice in stride, and any who don't can be... persuaded.\n\nHopefully, the Five Year Plan could turn this untrained society of peasants into a truly advanced industrial economy.

A war against the insidious forces of capitalism and cosmopolitanism. Serov's new Soviet Union will not fall like the last one, it will stand strong in the face of adversity. While the economy mobilizes, the proletariat must prepare as well. They must harden themselves, answer the call of duty, and weather the inevitable sacrifices they will be forced to face.\n\nUnder Ordosocialism, Russia is strong. In this world, the strong are destined to survive, while the weak perish. Bukharin's SOviet Union was weak, having embraced cosmopolitanism and become allies to capitalism, it was inevitable that it would be destroyed.

Russia has seen lots of conflict in the last several decades, and the military's high command all have lived through these conflicts and seen what works, and what doesn't.\n\nEvery military prepares for the last war they fought, and Russia's military shall be no exception. Specific ideas of interest can be picked up from the Great Patriotic War, with the Blitzkrieg quickly leaving Europe's armies disorganized and unable to keep up. Innovations to how we use armor, how we use aircraft, and how we use infantry should all be implemented into our doctrine. Of course, the West Russian War and the various warlord conflicts throughout Russia have also given us many valuable lessons to learn from.

The man is called the Red Napoleon for a reason, after all. That is why Serov ordered his generals to read up on Tukhachevsky's military theory, and find a way to implement it into their own doctrine.\n\nTukhachevsky's writings on discipline within the army interested the General-Secretary greatly, as they easily fell in line with Ordosocialism's teachings. Tukhachevsky desired the entire chain of command to adhere to this spartan discipline, purging generals who failed to uphold their duty. Of course, Serov's generals were far more eager to discuss the actual tactics Tukhachevsky described. Offensive deep battle, defeating the enemy not only at the line of contact, but throughout the battlefield. Tukhachevsky also placed great emphasis upon operations as a third level of military thinking, and a crucial part of military theory.\n\nSerov's generals had a lot of work ahead of them. Integrating these new theories on armor, aviation, reconnaissance, airborne units, command and control, and even chemical warfare would take some time and a lot of organization. However, through this momentary pain, the new military doctrine will be strong enough to preserve Russia through any conflict."

America claims to be the last bastion of freedom in the dark, cruel world, but they too serve the forces of capitalism and cosmopolitanism. They only aid regimes who serve their interests, abandoning any who wish to forge their own path to the wolves. There is no hope for freedom to be found amongst these nations, no friends to those who wish to liberate their peoples from their enslavement.\n\nThat changes today. The Soviet Union extends her hand to all the liberation movements across the world, and shall lead them into the light. Russia, too, has seen her people oppressed, her people enslaved, her people slaughtered. Russia has suffered a great deal of pain and bloodshed, but Russia shall rise from the ashes. We shall liberate our people, free them from their shackles, so that we may be the example that other nations aspire to become.\n\nTo any who desire to see their people freed, place your trust in us, in Russia, to support your dream!

They slammed shut their truck doors, the muck and sludge splashing onto their leather trench coats. They whipped out of their pistols, prepared to bring flashes of light to the dawn. Stomping into the hotel, they shuffled towards the contact, the German agent who would act as a middleman between their two polities, if only in an unofficial capacity.\n\nThe agents of Serov flooded the hotel, pushing over tables in search of hidden weaponry and cracking open the windows in case of an ambush. The head of Serov's agents, Yegor, took a seat with the German contact, cracking his knuckles and laying a pistol at the center of the table. He motioned to another agent, who brought forward a shot glass and a bottle of Koskenkorva Viina. Yegor looked insulted for a moment, before throwing the shot glass to the side and cracking open the Kossu. He chugged down the vodka, enough to refresh his throat, so, half the bottle.\n\n"These Finnish bastards get all the good alcohol. The war, the death, it could all be tolerated. But the lack of good drink? That is the greatest burden our people bear... Now, onto our" he chuckled to himself "negotiations." Yegor began to pat the rickety, wooden table upon which they sat. "We understand you can't yet begin any formal actions with our nation, so let Finland be our backdoor, for hands to be shaken and commerce to flow. We have depots in Lappeenranta, Uusimaa, and Vantaa. Now... what do you say, Hun?"\n\nThe German contact stared at his surroundings. The agents began to unfurl their knives and brass knuckles.

Yegor raises his arm, clenches his fist, and jams the needle into an exposed vein. Yegor doubles over, the rush of pain and euphoria washing over his body at once. The agents laugh and whistle, slapping tables and smashing bottles of alcohol. The walls are washed in grime and soot, and homeless addicts litter the corners of the den. A neon haze emanates from the deadlights above. Yegor rests himself on his seat, clenching... something. The walls wash away, and the faces of the agents look to be photos of the purged and maimed. Yegor leans back, the drugs taking a toll on his cognition.\n\nA strange sight appears. A lanky, pale figure in business attire appears to sit in front of him. Yegor looks to his comrades, confused at what this vision could mean. Recalling his mission, he remembers that he was to meet a contact... of some sort. Unable to speak, Yegor stares forward at the blurry visage which may or may not be the contact. The figure unfurls a black, long, thing. Wielding the brain activity he still possesses, Yegor recognizes it as a weapon. This was... a weapons smuggler, yes. The agents move ever closer, forming a circle around Yegor and the figure. Yegor glances to and fro, beads of sweat rolling off his face.\n\nThis was... this was... a Breton! It was some sort of deal about the black market and the trafficking of agents worldwide. The details had long been lost to Yegor's mind. After eternity, or perhaps a few seconds, the figure stood tall, reaching out his... hand, maybe? Yegor pulsed his muscles.

Every moment Yegor didn't get his dosage, his skin seemed to melt and his mental state broke further down. At every thought of the needle penetrating his skin, a hook sank into his flesh and pulled him down, further and further, into a pit of impotent fury. This man's death would mean nothing. Yegor's trigger finger itched, but he restrained himself.

Speak up, little man, before the floor is painted. I need a supplier, or else you're dead. You hear me?

He began to hyperventilate, and snot ran down his chin like a schoolboy who scraped his knee. "Look... sir. I t-told you. The Bretons are shutting down black market activities. They're c-cleaning their hands of it."\n\nA shot rang out. The clerk slouched over, stuck in a kneeling position, as blood streamed from his forehead onto the concrete floor. Yegor heaved of feeble indignation. In a burst of anger, he kicked the clerk's corpse and punched at the walls which surrounded him, only to be left bent over with broken knuckles and lost hope.

The third corpse is for those who follow in the footsteps of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, but do not love Russia, or its people. Revisionists, and corruptors of socialism. The fourth corpse is those most tragic of deaths. Followers of socialist thought and nationalists, who have, nevertheless, rebelled against our righteous authority. They are contrarians, who seek to destroy instead of reform. The fifth corpse is for a hidden threat, those who claim to follow our ideals in full, but lie. Their parents, and the parents of their parents, have imparted upon them reactionary ideals, which goes on to taint them throughout their lives. But, they are sly, these bourgeois parasites will do whatever it takes to remain alive until the dawning of our Russia, so that they may leech off of the state.

And for what purpose?\n\nMusing, his eyes wandered to the dustiest corner of his history book collection. A HISTORY OF THE RUSSIAN FAR EAST, 1895 TO 1940. He'd scoured the demographic history of the Union in virtually every other area - perhaps the land beyond the Amur would provide some insight? He took its hefty weight, checked the spine for defects, and began to read.\n\nEvening turned to dawn. Serov put his book down, his eyes wide and unblinking. He'd uncovered a conspiracy vast in scale - a conspiracy to infiltrate the corners of the Union with rootless people - and it went all the way to the top. Yes, he had the answer for his agricultural-industrial malaise. It had been staring him in the face this whole time. Now it was time to warn the rest of Russia's Workers and to pray that he had not been too late.\n\nThe very next week, posters bearing Asiatic figures appeared on every city of every district in the Republic: BE ON GUARD FOR "KOREAN" PARASITES, WORKERS! THE KORYO-SARAM MENACE MUST BE DESTROYED!"

The security forces stand ready to conduct a search on key targets from several opposing factions suspected to have a presence in the country.\n\nTheir base of power will wither away without a strong leader at the reins, so surgical strikes targeting the head of the dissenting groups is necessary.

Penetrating his inner circle in the past has been quite difficult due to the highly-indoctrinated and even fanatical nature of many of his closest associates, and it stands to reason that his present circumstances may only exacerbate this tendency.

Although Bukharina is undoubtedly an effective political force in her own right, her symbolic value is arguably far more threatening, and she could serve as an effective rallying point for Bukharinist holdouts.

His military experience, along with his training in counterintelligence and deception, likely makes him a highly elusive and resourceful foe who will require significant resource investment to track down.

Search parties in the area have found multiple corpses; initially, these were believed to be followers who had died of exposure to the elements.

Out from the ashes, a phoenix burned, holding the ideals of thousands and thousands, of a stable Republic, of something that every Russian would gladly call their home.\n\nYet unlike a phoenix, Komi was burnt too badly, and the phoenix of democracy crumbled back into ashes. As Voznesensky ran into the night, death grazing his shoulder multiple times, he finally found himself at the edge of a river. From the other side, there were new pastures, and on the bottom of the river near him sat a small boat made for one person. He had arranged it for himself and only himself, in the dead of night, so that no guard could spot and open fire at a traitor of the new Komi.\n\nWhen he settled himself down and began to cross the river, he looked back. Perhaps in these new lands of Vyatka, he could make change. Perhaps, he thought, it was unnecessary to dream about what Komi had been. It was stabler in Vyatka, potentially even richer. There was a Tsar, and while that in itself didn't bode well, he knew that it was no autocracy. Elements of freedom still remained, and, unlike Komi, were not directly threatened by forces that wished to lock it all away. As Voznesensky looked back, he felt the grip on the paddles weaken, though remain firm. He didn't wish to cross, but he knew that he only had one choice.\n\nBy the time he arrived on the other side, he only wished to lay down and rest, for the horrible realization that struck his mind only kept growing and growing in his mind.

Every hour, every minute, he cursed himself for not taking enough action. He knew the eventual fate of Komi, yet kept himself silent. Now he had paid the ultimate price, and the only thing that came his way was downfall. He hadn't even learned about the fate of Svetlana Stalina, a fact that haunted him every step of the way. There were the fates of many to worry about, but he shared with her a sort of grim opinion of Komi's democracy that, unfortunately, turned out to be true.\n\nNow, guided by the strobes of moonlight his escape from the compromised nation came into fruition. In the thick forests, there were no guards, no tachankas, nothing that could stop him. Only the blowing wind and the idle sounds of forest life. Even then, his nerves were on-guard, and Kosygin felt that this trip through the forest would be the makings of a new source of paranoia - but he had to brave the sheer emptiness of it all, the lack of human life, and pray that he would not suddenly receive a bullet to the back.\n\nAt the crack of next dawn, Kosygin found himself on the other side. He wasn't sure what sort of freedom he would find, and he didn't know if it would truly be a better fate than death at the hands of the radicals.

But Suslov's suspicion about something like that happening so easily led him to repeatedly asking that same question, and, as noon turned down midnight, he began actively fidgeting, pressing his thumbs to his hands and moving them up and down. That was the only sign he gave, and that was enough to send worry to the other agents in the vehicle, driver included. If he was worried, they pretended not to notice, but they, along with Suslov, knew.\n\nWhen the hour struck somewhere within the night, his tired voice asked yet again. "Have we made it?" It sounded like Suslov was to pass out soon enough, but he wouldn't dare do that. Not when his life was on the line. He waited and waited, until he received his answer.

Shame, for Andrey Zhdanov had every right to attempt to save the Republic from the decadence of capitalism and its fascist and fascist-adjacent allies.

Even as he took off into the cover of night, keeping his identification card in his back pocket and driving through the dark streets of Komi towards the West Russian Revolutionary Front, he was stopped by two guards on the border. "Name and identification, please." One of them ordered, and Zhdanov was more than happy to comply. "I am Andrey Zhdanov," he began, passionate yet worried at the same time. "A political refugee from Komi. The nation has fallen into chaos!" He exclaimed, and the guards eyed him warily.\n\n"Chaos?" One of them asked, returning Zhdanov's identification card to him. "Yes!"

Now Russia would never again be the center of the world as it was always destined to be. In Vyatka there was a Tsar, unfocused and unguided, a fact that did little to alleviate his anger, as it was only marginally better than the betrayal he found in Komi. There, at least, he would not be put up for a mock trial and executed shortly afterwards, if even given such the privilege back home.\n\nWhen the driver was almost at the border, he stopped at the sidewalk and demanded his pay, unceremoniously kicking Gumilyov out as if he was any other civilian. If only he was still in the National Assembly and treated as someone who wasn't to be executed on the spot. Calmly and politely, Gumilyov travelled the rest of the distance on-foot, and met no resistance.

Now it was all for naught.\n\nNow he had fled his post as Elected Deputy, reduced to nothing more than a target and a traitor of the state he wished to do nothing more with. He had left almost everything behind him; his post, his home, his car, his valuables. Everything except the clothes on his back, his papers of identification, and a heavyset book that he refused to leave behind\n\nHe blended in amongst the dozens and dozens that flooded the station. Such as the state of Komi was that everything had a hint of chaos to it, even in the daily life of a citizen, and Shafarevich's heart skipped a beat when he had to face a guard. But he hadn't recognized him. He was merely a man among many others who did not care about the trappings of politics. Only the safety of their personal lives.\n\nAs Shafarevich boarded the train, he pondered that possibility. When night fell upon the passengers and himself, and the chugging of the engine lulled him to sleep, he grasped the book in his hands tighter. Mathematics had always had a passion in his heart.

His path was clear and straightforward. All that was needed was a push. That push came in the form of a car drive in a vehicle he had anonymously bought days before. By the time the sun came down, Serov was already at the border, staring down a pair of guards whose faces seemed awfully familiar to him.\n\nRolling his window down, he began pulling out his papers when they came up to his car and heard them start talking.

"And you wish to cross into the West Russian Revolutionary Front." That was not a question, Serov could notice, but he nodded anyway.\n\nWith a sigh, the guard handed the papers back to him. "You will see a building a kilometer north from here. Go there and begin processing your documents. Have a good day..." The guard's expression never betrayed an emotion. "Sir."

And they would not, either. Too far did they fall from Taboritsky's gaze. Too strongly were they influenced by the workings of madmen - the lunatics of Zion ever-cursed by the mark of Cain, the murderers and bandits that belonged in the clique of the Communists, and the atheistic spirits who gouged their own eyes out in the name of progress, who silenced their ears to listen to the cry of democracy, and cut their own tongues out to join the ignoble masses. His were the pleas of sanity that were left to rot in the dirt, in likeness of their belief that Tsarevich Alexei did stand in waiting, did not hide in shadows until Russia's savior would come at last, that he was 'dead', 'executed'.\n\nThe case of Komi was one of undoctored insanity, and Taboritsky would not wait for its ill effects to pass on to him. There was a new place to go, and only one stood in the ashes of Russia as something perhaps passable, perhaps not. This so-called 'Aryan Brotherhood', and to get there he had to go through the land of Vyatka. The false Tsar, he would not pity him by remembering his name, was nothing to him. Merely an obstacle.\n\nFor day and night and day and night did Taboritsky cross land and broke through the biting cold, the enemies of the Lord; nothing could prevent his path. When Taboritsky began his journey, his pistol was loaded with eight shots.\n\nBy the time he arrived at the borders of the Brotherhood, all eight were guided by the hand of God to those who were to oppose him."

The next, one of them was dead on the ground, and they rushed towards cover.n\nNow she was stuck behind a collection of soaked trees and wet bushes, the rain making it difficult to move, to see, and to shoot. Occasionally she would glance to her brother from the opposite side, who remained steadfast and silent. She was a good shot, but Vasily was better, though she could feel his nervousness climb with every bullet fired. In the myriad of flashes of light, she decided to call out to her brother. "Vasily!" She yelled, and her brother opened fire. "Vasily!" She shouted again, pulling back the bolt on her gun. He turned around, and looked at her with an expression both annoyed and concerned. "We must pull back! I'm running low on ammo, a-"\n\nIn the blackness of midnight, the misty cloud of dark red that sprouted in front of her was paired with a crack that rippled through the air and her mind, and she felt her body go cold. "Vasily?" She muttered, seeing his body drop as everything became difficult to observe. "Vasily! VASILY!" The weapon in her hands violently clattered against the ground, as she took hurried, unpaced steps towards whatever unfocused shape there was on the ground. She could feel static in her ears, protruding everywhere around her, as sharp pain coursed through her knees when they landed against mud and dirt, and her hands tightly grasped cloth and skin.\n\n"Brother-" She choked out, catching a breath as tremors ran up her arms. "Brother. Move, please. Please start moving." It was difficult to take in air, and everything was so loud. Everything was so, so very loud. The static burned her ears, and the ringing deafened them.

Now he was far away from civilization, wandering between Russia's trees and the crickets of night life that made him jump in his skin. He knew, damned as he was, knew that Komi would capitulate itself to the chaos Voznesensky refused to deal with. But it was too late now, and he paid for it in form of exile.\n\nKeeping himself steady, he moved deeper into the forest. By the time the sun shone down on him, he would be out of Komi territory and into safety. That was the hope. The truth was that such hopes would be dashed into the ground. It came in the form of a gunshot; crackling and powerful from his left side, Kosygin's heart dropped and his arms went cold. He wasn't hit, but perhaps it was worse because of it, as his legs thumped and feet began pounding against the dirt and mud and leaves that all fell around him. He was already tired before, now he brinked on exhaustion.\n\nHe barely kept his eyes forward as he ran, only enough to see what trees to dodge and what foliage to jump over, while his mind whirred with chaos and fear. Was this the end? All it would take was one shot. Kosygin grit his teeth and fired blindly to his side, quickly emptying the magazine of his pistol. Every shot missed, he knew, but as if penance struck him, he felt one of his legs go numb, and Kosygin fell, his head slamming against the hard ground.\n\nWith a pounding headache, a throbbing heart, and a tremoring body, Kosygin's lips formed the words for mercy.

To the more amicable members of the National Assembly, he did not know their fates. Nor did he want to. Anywhere from freedom to painful death awaited them. To his enemies he cursed their names, but nothing more. They, he figured, would be left behind him.\n\nThere was a river that separated the nation of Komi from the Tsarists in Vyatka, and he figured it his best option of escaping. So he convinced the local fisherman to lend him a boat. Just a simple crossing, he said, then it would be returned to him. That night, as he carefully walked through the grass and to the border separating him from life and death, Voznesensky felt like something was off. Something was different in the air that night than the one before it- but he had no time to think on it.\n\nInstead, he got on the boat, and began to paddle to the other side. It brought him some peace of it, the simplicity of it. A simplicity that he, unfortunately, could not take in for long.\n\nGunfire ripped holes into his body from behind, as they pierced the wooden structure of the boat.

The other two would sit in the back of the van and serve as muscle and firepower. Suslov would be hanging back as well, sufficiently armed for an extended firefight. As they got into the vehicle, he could feel the air tighten. Again, Suslov felt that something was wrong, but he made no emotion present. Merely warning his guards to keep their eyes and ears out - especially the driver. The goal was simple. Get to Vologda.\n\nYet only ten minutes after starting their journey, Suslov's suspicions were proven right. Bullets pierced the door to the back of the van, and he ducked his head down, grabbing tightly his rifle as one bodyguard rushed to the front. The driver kept his eyes on the road and began swerving left and right, and Suslov and his other bodyguard kicked open the back doors in tandem, revealing something they had to pay attention to immediately.\n\nTwo open-topped cars trailed past them, both armed with gunmen, both making holes in the van. Suslov immediately got on the floor, bringing up the iron sights and opening fire as his bodyguard was not so lucky, crying out in pain and collapsing in a huddled mess. The exchange went on for a few seconds more before Suslov heard his bodyguard at the front begin to open fire as well, and he could see the vehicle in front of him begin drifting sideways, the driver slumped back as it eventually slammed into the off-road.\n\nBut Suslov was not a lucky man. Even though he felt secure in victory, fear began to finally grip his heart when he heard flesh rip behind him. Letting go of his gun, Suslov began running to the driver's seat.

Opportunities he'd let slip through his fingers, connections he'd missed...\n\n"Better get used to it, comrade. It'll be even colder on the barge this time of year."\n\nAt least Borisov had picked him a good driver. A genial boy, true socialist Russian. "I suppose it will. How far are we from the harbor?"\n\n"It will be another half hour at least, I have to drive carefully in this weather"\n\nThe harbor, then the barge, then north-west on the Dvina. He'd take his chances with the Front. He'd rebuild a small platform there and then, when the corruption and incompetence of the damned coup-makers had been exposed, he'd return and pick up where he left off. The ones who followed him before would follow again, and more would listen after seeing... Something felt strange.\n\n"Why are we stopping?"\n\n"There's something in the road", the driver answered. The "something" turned out to be another car blocking their way, surrounded by a handful of uniformed men. Already on their feet by the time they stopped, the men moved quickly towards them.\n\n"Get us out of here, boy! Whoever those men are, they're bad news for us!"\n\n"I'm sorry comrade. This the end of the road for me"\n\nIt didn't take the men long to pull him out of the car and tie up his hands and feet.

Three times, he bowed, whispering, "God, be merciful to me, a sinner."\n\nHe concluded the morning ritual in peace. When he turned back to his dacha, he heard approaching trucks. They stopped outside, the soldiers getting off. They entered his garden, searching for him. He felt his stomach turn as they came, instincts tugging at him to run. But he couldn't. They had caught him before he could think of any kind of escape.\n\nA sergeant informed him of his arrest while two soldiers took him by the arms. He did nothing. Later, he was brought into one of the trucks.\n\nHe appealed to his Lord, hoping for the tsarevich's intercession, who was sure to come.\n\n"Holy God, give me strength," he prayed, even when they nudged him to be quiet, "O God, cleanse me a sinner for I have done nothing good before Thee."\n\nWhen they finally reached the end, they marched him into the prison. He strained to hear God's reply as the soldiers continued with him. A deep yet comforting voice, which Taboritsky alone heard, came to his ear."Be strong. Keep in thy mind the memory of my servant." And a familiar hand touched his shoulder just for a moment.\n\nHis body shivered with the spirit and the guards simply kept him moving until they brought him to an empty cell.\n\nBefore they pushed him in, they freed his hands. "Lord, receive my spirit," he finally said, crossing himself, after they shoved him in. He did not turn around to look at them go after they locked him up. Instead, his eyes were lifted up, seeing God smile upon him for his faith, with the tsarevich by his right hand and Saint Stephen at his left."

He claims that the Turkish and Russian peoples are of the same blood, the same family, and that family should work together. Gumilyov's government is apparently somewhat obsessed with the idea of 'Eurasia,' and part of that means that Gumilyov wishes to see Russia becoming more ingrained into Asian politics, rather than European ones.\n\nThe diplomats claim that their government just wishes to see our governments merely enter an open and friendly relationship, and claims they hold no ulterior motives with the request. However, the devil Bukharin claimed the same thing when they imposed their atheist regime on our people. Kazakhstan has been shackled to Russia for far too long.\n\nSome of the members of our government say that we should consider the offer, and that having a friendly, but distinctly independent, relationship with Russia could prevent Kazakhstan from being enslaved once more.

At this rate, he'd have to wait another decade before he could retire.\n\nNot if I die in there, he thought darkly to himself. Mournfully, Igor grabbed his pick and started back into the cave when one of his men, a younger man in his 20s, slammed into Igor, nearly knocking the both of them to the ground.

Without proper guidance, the flames would burn out of control and become a wildfire, consuming the very nation he had worked so hard to establish. He had to retain power if he was to guide Eurasia along the correct path and restrain its self-destructive urges. But the Russians...\n\nGumilyov scowled. The Russians - or rather, the Russian nationalists - didn't understand that. It was a funny idea of Eurasia they had: Russia, but with a different name and different excuses for oppressing its brother ethnoses. He had already been forced to make too many concessions to them, and their influence was steadily growing. He hadn't done all this just to see the Eurasian project succumb to the same chauvinism that fostered hatred between the ethnoses.\n\nDowning the vodka and flicking his cigarette into the fire, Gumilyov stood and headed over to his bookshelf to find something to calm his nerves. Maybe the Secret History. Genghis Khan's life was a great inspiration, after all. Someday, he would see the legendary ruler's vision fulfilled - hopefully with a little less bloodshed."

At first, we attempted to replace sections of the brain with mechanical interfaces, although, through this method none of the subjects were able to survive longer than two to six minutes.

Through cybernetic implants, into the back of the neck or around the nose, subjects were able to move the cursor on the monitor.

Following this procedure, the operators of the initiative uplinked connection systems into and around the lymph nodes of the subject's necks, and into the brain stems of the subjects. These connection systems served to apply electrodes to the subjects, and graph the brain-wave activity of the subjects for use in data collection. The subjects themselves, procured from the GULAG system, all demonstrated obedient, somewhat sycophantish behavior when faced with the operators of the initiative. The connection systems uplinked the subjects to a [DATA EXPUNGED], to serve as a prototype for the collective consciousness system. Once initiated, subjects in testing periods one (1) through fourteen (14) all [REDACTED] due to malfunctions in the technology of the [DATA EXPUNGED], ranging from electricity being set too high, to misplacement of the uplink implant locations. For testing periods fifteen (15) through nineteen (19), all subjects remained [REDACTED] for the entirety of the testing period. However, upon the uplink being removed, all subjects experienced dizziness, and four (4) fainted for periods ranging from thirty (30) minutes to fifteen (15) hours. Following interrogation of subjects, a majority reported experiencing a state of collective consciousness, and recalled how they could feel the same sensations as other subjects. To add, some differences in subject behavior were noticed afterwards, although nothing that would suggest undergoing a procedure as dramatic as collective consciousness. The reliability of the subjects is also questionable.

The reality of Ultravisionary Socialism as the preeminent ideology of the globe could be spread through uplink, rather than be debated and fought over.\n\nTaken aback by the possibilities, Zhdanov drifted into a dream unto himself. A dream of great, monolithic structures, floating and roaring throughout the astral plane. Clouds of electric mist, of deep purples and violets, surrounding the innovations of man. Brotherhoods of humanity, wielding their collective knowledge to construct a future unimaginable to the average man of today. A future beyond the boundaries of Earth, wherein Ultravisionary Socialism can reach the Solar System, and the nebulas beyond.

They were a wife and husband, who had each volunteered for the experiments, claiming to be "psychics" for the reward of food and vouchers, as was advertised. It only took a couple months for them to become the lab's favorite guinea pigs. None of the psychics had been in any intimate relationships with the other psychics, but these two, they were special in that regard. Perhaps telepathic links could be strengthened through love and knowledge of each other? Whether or not the case, their stay in the testing labs had exceeded months over the promised timeframe.\n\nStaring at each other, each with gaunt, skeletal complexions and shaved heads, they sulked in the misery of their situation. Bullet-proof glass separated them. Yesterday, it was rusty metal, and before that it was a curtain of broken wires. Everyday it was a new material separating them, a new sound in the background, and a new color of light hanging above their heads. Finally, able to see each other, their eyes met. It had been months since they last saw, and with whatever moisture left in their bodies, they cried at the sight of one another. The wife pointed her eyes towards a ventilation shaft on the wall, the researcher's method of viewing their behavior. She began nodding her head, as if she was talking, but she didn't move her mouth. The husband followed step. Their "conversation" went on for hours, before the scientists intervened.\n\n"We would like to know, what would you say caused this surge of telepathy?

After recalibrating the operation, the second subject, [REDACTED], remained somewhat stable through two procedures (note, the second procedure was not voluntary). The second subject was transferred to facility XYX following mental breakdown. The operation was, again, recalibrated for the third subject.

Further refinement is in progress.\n\nOur evaluation of fifty-one (51) subjects, aged 18-60 months at the start of the experiment, over a period of several months indicates a major increase in altruistic behavior, absent any other stimuli or education beyond what a subject in the control group received. Prompted descriptions by test subjects of the concepts of capitalism, socialism, community, and other such terms also demonstrates a statistically significant level of approval of concepts we have sought to linguistically code as desirable, and a similar negative correlation with concepts coded as undesirable.\n\nWorking with psychologists and education specialists, we have created a series of instructive documents outlining the purpose and basic principles of our "new Russian," as well as the major differences between the language.

They were placed into Compound XXX, a large mansion that could accommodate every need. They were supplied with food, entertainment material, and never interfered with aside from the Subliminal Messaging. For a three (3) month period, the subjects were allowed to do as they pleased. Most went about their ordinary lives, occupying themselves with readings and social interactions. The experiment itself began on week two (2): whenever a subject found themselves isolated, we would play low-level white noise in their room, coupled with occasional subliminal phrases meant to influence the subject into taking certain actions. The entirety of the compound was equipped with speaker systems.\nBy week six (6), all subjects had experienced the phrases and elected to stick together. By your authorization on XX/XX/XX, we began playing the white noise and subliminal messages even when the subjects were in groups. By the final month, the program would play nearly every day, up to four hours a day.\nResult: At first, the subjects refused to comply with the messages, so we toned down the requests. By week eight (8) we were no longer requesting actions, but rather filtering in phrases from the propagandist's office. After the experiment's conclusion, the subjects were questioned. No changes in behaviour or belief were noted, nor had their anti-revolutionary stance changed. Instead, all subjects reported weakness due to lack of sleep.\nPost-Test: All subjects have been returned to the GULAG system. The compound is to be repurposed for different experiments."

Since you have certainly passed the accuracy tests, I believe it is about time to transition to the simulation tests, don't you agree?' said the engineer standing behind the soldier. He looked especially smug about receiving praise from Turgenev, who had harshly criticized many of his previous designs.\n\n'Yeah, sure. Hopefully it doesn't snap when I get off the helicopter. Thing's light as a feather.'\n\nPROJECT TARAKAN - TEST 37 RESULTS:\nComrade Afanasyev's design has passed all of the necessary tests. It has performed as expected in airborne drop scenarios, and has been proven to be functional as an infantry weapon. Comrade Afanasyev has managed to reduce the inaccuracy caused by the rifle's unique characteristics down to a margin of 5%. Soldiers testing the weapon report its unusually light weight as a major boon, and some officers have already requested the Tarakan prototype rifle, official name pending, for use in airborne operations.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nProject Tarakan has proven to be a success, and Comrade Afanasyev's design meets all requirements necessary for production authorization. The Tarakan prototype rifle is to enter mass-production for use in special forces, mechanized, and airborne infantry units. Comrade Afanasyev has submitted several new weapon designs for greenlight approval, evidently eager to repeat his successes."

Your. Shitty. Rifle,' with that said, Turgenev walked away from the firing range. The engineer too afraid to continue the argument.\n\nPROJECT TARAKAN - TEST 41 RESULTS:\nComrade Asfanasyev's 'bullpup' design has faced numerous problems during its development. The chief issue being its long-range accuracy. The extremely short barrel and extremely light weight have a tendency to drastically reduce the accuracy of those using the rifle. Test 41 concluded when the soldier testing the rifle, Sargeant Sergei Turgenev, grew frustrated with the rifle's inaccuracy and exited the firing range. Sergeant Sergei Turgenev received a brief reprimand for his poor behavior, but is expected to return to normal duty within the week.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe Tarakan prototype rifle has failed to meet any accuracy standards required for production, and development of the rifle is growing too expensive to justify the rifle's somewhat niche purpose. As such, it is recommended that Comrade Asfanasyev's project be defunded, and for him to be returned to his position within the Soviet Instrument Design Bureau."

Similarly, the laser wiped out a radar system without harming the dog sitting next to it, and the Szhatie prototype effectively tracked and disable three aircraft, forcing their pilots to bail. It was surprisingly silent too, a small buzzing sound that was easily drowned out by the sound of the generator's roar. The prototype had surpassed all expectations he had had for it, and the scientist next to him kept rambling on and on about the many scientific miracles that went into building it. Clearly he was proud of his work.\n\n'So, Comrade Aslanov, how much would it cost to make more of these miraculous weapons? They've clearly proven their effectiveness,' The general expected some long-winded response from the overly talkative scientist, but instead he went deathly pale and went silent. That couldn't be a good sign.\n\nPROJECT SZHATIE RESULTS: Partial Success\n\nCONCLUSION: While the Project Szhatie prototype exceeded all expectations, and passed all tests with flying colors. The officer overseeing the tests initially advocated for further production, until learning of the costs. The artificial rubies used to focus the laser are prohibitively expensive, and drastically raise the cost of production. This alone makes Project Szhatie unfeasible for mass-production, however the design is also limited by its massive power requirements, which likewise raise the design's cost. General Varennikov suggests handing the prototype over to the propaganda department, on the basis of the prototype being 'absolutely marvelous."

The variable sweep wings have proven to be highly effective in their role, allowing the bomber to use a much shorter runway for takeoff and avoid the danger of stalls at high speeds. The bomber is planned to be capable of carrying both heavy cruise missiles for standard targets and lighter rocket pods for softer targets.\n\nPerformance-wise, the bomber has met all parameters expected, surpassing Mach 3 and having a service ceiling of 12,000 meters, high enough to evade German interceptors and anti-aircraft weapons. Avionics data suggests that the expected loadout will be well within its capabilities. The cost of developing such an aircraft has been extensive, as more than six hundred patents have been filed based on this project alone, but as production scales we will find more efficient methods of producing the necessary parts.

Our attempt to work with the specifications given has been far from a resounding success, but has some promise. The vehicle suffers from many of the same issues as the German tanks captured during the last war, particularly the Tiger and Maus. CHEREPAKHA solves a number of problems those vehicles suffered from, particularly the unreliability of the drive train and excessive fuel consumption, and overall is able to maintain a higher level of performance for longer.\n\nHowever, a number of other problems have emerged as a result of our solutions to the original problems. The lead lining of the crew compartment, the four-track drive train, and the unusual disc shape have resulted in the need for us to establish a completely new production line at the Izhevsk plant to create the prototype. Maintenance has also been an issue, as access to the mechanical portions of the tank is limited due to the design of the tank, and makes field repairs effectively impossible.\n\nIn spite of these difficulties, the vehicle has performed quite well in trials run by our personnel and demonstrations run for our military procurement officials, proving highly resistant to artillery fire and to rarely break down. It is not suitable for mass deployment, as it lacks mobility to contend with modern battle tanks, but it possesses the armor and firepower that allows it to take on anything lighter, and will certainly fill an important niche in our military."

Senior Engineer Korobov and his team have overcome the anticipated problems related to the feed system, having implemented an innovative method of allowing each barrel to be fed by the same magazine, requiring the operator use a single ninety round magazine instead of one for each individual barrel. The rifle can also be fired ambidextrously since the cartridges are ejected behind the magazine. The rifle's rate of fire meets projected expectations, approximately 3 times faster than our currently equipped Kalashnikov rifles, and is chambered in the same 7.62x39 caliber.\n\nThe primary issues encountered in testing resulted from increased recoil, due to the greater amount of propellant used in each pull of the trigger. The rifle is also heavier than our current standard-issue rifles, and presents a considerable logistical challenge by expending three times as much ammunition as a standard Kalashnikov.\n\nHowever, if these logistical issues can be overcome, the rifle will serve as an excellent front-line infantry weapon.

The feed system has encountered numerous problems with jamming, and our engineers were unable to solve the problem of ejecting the cartridges. After some failed experiments with caseless ammunition they have settled on the 7.62x39mm round used in Kalashnikov's automatic rifles, which should allow us to integrate it into our supply chain with relative ease.\n\nIncreased recoil has led us to recommend the addition of a bipod and an increase in the size of the weapon to allow the inclusion of a more robust feed system. Once this is completed, we will be able to put this weapon into production as a functional heavy support rifle. The increased rate of fire allows it to properly fulfill its role without consuming too much ammunition, and the jamming rate will be significantly reduced by the time we begin the manufacturing process.\n\nThe weight of the weapon makes it prohibitively heavy to issue as a standard infantry rifle, but it is lighter than most of our machine guns, and the use of a magazine instead of a belt makes it simple for any soldier trained in operating a Kalashnikov to use. Overall, the new weapon should make a fine addition to our armories."

The weak light illuminated his work, the schematics for a road, again. Chalk-dust caked his hands, and he looked at his watch. Almost dawn. Yet, this work could not wait. There were no longer fetters to his progress. No more Suslov, no more Stalina, no more Taboritsky, and, sadly, no more Gumilyov. He missed them. Enemies they were, and adversaries, yet they almost seemed to be a call-back to easier times, when he was just a mathematician with tenure in Syktyvkar's university.\n\nIt was, again, a road. Street plans, points of illumination, specifications of material. As President of the Republic, his work had come to take entire days to finish. It was rare that he got the chance to work on an independent project of his. The roads were uncluttered, clear, ways of transport that ferried the pedestrians to their places, safe and quick.\n\nHe stepped back, and clapped his hands together, dispersing clouds of white over his uniform.

However, if we are to reclaim the rightful borders of the Soviet Union, we must firmly establish ourselves as a government that is efficient, stable, and strong- the opposite of the Voznesensky regime."\n\n"To this end, I have prepared a series of proposals that will enable us to assert state control while presenting the Russian people with a better life than the one they experienced under the bandits and collaborators who occupied their homes. Once this is accomplished, we must maneuver east, and reclaim the lost resources and industry of Siberia."\n\n"We will now have a report from Comrade Varennikov on the state of our military. Following that, the floor will be opened for discussion.""

The eyes that never wavered from the person he was speaking to, holding the blank expression everyone from his closest friend to his worst enemy received. The impeccable state of dress that he always maintained, even amidst the chaos of the Komi Republic. Or perhaps it was simply the manner in which he carried himself, cocksure and poised even at the most unimportant times.\n\n"The problem of the progressives, Premier. They have been ceaselessly pushing for us to enact their reforms, claiming that the state has a responsibility to promote the welfare of neglected citizens. This would be an inconvenience in peacetime. It is exceptionally dangerous at a time where the Union is surrounded by potential enemies."\n\n"And what do you require from me, General Secretary?" Ponomaryov had long known who to listen to- Suslov's machinations were precise and robust, and playing your part in them was a wise decision.\n\n"I want you to give into their demands. They must believe we have addressed their concerns. Extol the values of progressivism and specify how we have reached those aims. This will be our goal until the problem goes away, or until we have to adapt."\n\n"I'll prepare a speech immediately.""

Our Soviet sisters are not to be treated as mindless cattle or neglected like the capitalist West, but to take an equal position alongside the men of the Soviet Union."\n\n"In the dark, desperate days of the fascist invasion, and then our war of liberation under the West Russian Revolutionary Front, women served in the factories, the fields, and the fighting to preserve our glorious nation, and in spite of every effort by the German fascists to grind us into dust, we are still here.

Unlike the bourgeoisie capitalists and oppressive fascists who value women only as homemakers and broodmares, socialist society has advanced to a point where women serve in equal positions to men. Our investigations found this to hold true from the factories of Gorki to the fields of Bashkortostan.' Isn't this what you've been advocating since the days of Vosnesensky?"\n\n"So thanks to this proclamation my neighbor has stopped beating his wife when dinner is not to his satisfaction? And that when women are sent into a factory that they are treated properly by the men who tell them what to do? What do you think this actually does?"\n\n"It allows us to focus on restoring the Union, Katya! The party has allowed women to work in the place of men to strengthen us, and you're giving me this hysterical anti-state lecture-"\n\n"You're hopeless, Vanya."

As they settled in and whispered into the microphones, the host greeted them and asked about their journey northwards, to which they responded with horrific stories of the freezing cold and the escape from bandits and murderers.\n\nEventually, the host came to the topic of the socialist cause in Russia, and what it meant to the guest. He remained silent for a moment, thinking about the question, before answering with bold and proud statements of admiration, confessing that even after living under brutal fascist indoctrination, we remained true to the teachings of Marx and Lenin. Furthermore, he detailed that many in Samara believed similar things, but were not so fortunate to escape from the grips of the fascist bandit regime.\n\nAs the interview concluded, the radio host thanked his guest and asked if he had any final words for the people living in western Russia. He cleared his throat and replied in his timid voice, urging the people to remain vigilant to the red torch of socialism, even when living in the most vile and brutal conditions, as the liberating march of the Red Army will rescue them soon as they rescued him. Emphasizing this message, the host thanked the guest again before finishing his interview and returning to the normal broadcast schedule expected by his audience."

Suslov did not look up from his writing.\n\n"No, General Secretary."\n\nThe response took seconds, but the unnaturally long pause felt far longer. "Comrade Genera-"\n\n"Your writings have caused me grave concern, Comrade Ignatyev. I am concerned that the ideas you espouse in them are undesirable and contrary to the principles of the revolution. I expect this to be remedied immediately. You are a delegate of the Supreme Soviet and you will behave as one. Malcontents will not be tolerated by the party, the new Soviet Union, or myself.

The waitress set down eight cups of tea on the table, plucking one off her tray after the other.\n\nThe comrade in the suit reached first, then the suited comrade, then the comrade who wore a suit. The clique sipped at their tea. "Quite good." said one.\n\n"Quite." said the other, stirring the drink. Silent was the table.\n\nOne eventually disturbed the stillness, "Quite good indeed, not too unlike the direction of the party." The table nodded in agreement.\n\n"My tea is bitter," Piped up one member of the table, "It tastes old."\n\nThe table responded with a chorus of affirmation. The consensus was clear, the tea was old. "Shall I call the waitress then?"\n\n"No, no. The owner doesn't care for complaints, he'd have us removed." The table murmured in agreement. So they grumbled, but still sipped their tea. "

It was no use. He needed a drink before he'd make any progress tonight. Arvids pushed back his chair and made his way for the kitchen. It wasn't a long journey, from one side of his apartment to the other, but it felt liberating just to be away from the desk. The downside was, however, he'd have to walk past him.\n\nThe portrait of Mikhail Suslov watched him as he made his way to his cabinet and retrieved his drink of choice. "Slacking on the job?" The portrait asked. "I should expect nothing less from you Comrade Pelshe." Arvids shook the thoughts from his head. It was going to be alright, even if the reports were less than stellar, it wasn't damning. It meant there was room for improvement and Comrade Suslov ate up talk of improving, especially if it adheres to orthodox methods. Best of both worlds he'd say.\n\nArvids hobbled back to his desk, the papers strewn across his desk, hanging from the walls, dripping out from the clouds above, he inhaled reports and exhaled them back out. He plopped into his chair, put on his glasses, and read the bold text at the top of the document."

He knew the economy, he at least could say that much. His job was to analyze the market and mold it to the worker's best interest. What Arvids enjoyed more than putting his knowledge into practice was sharing it with just about anybody who would listen.\n\nSpeaking at the Syktyvkar Academy of State Service and Administration, Comrade Pelshe fell into his stride near immediately, speaking at length about the superiority of the socialist system employed by Comrade Suslov. What the economist didn't account for was for someone to talk back. Such is natural living day to day as and with yes men.\n\n"Comrade Pelshe," asked one of the pupils, "Should we not adhere to the foundation laid down by Comrade Buhkarin? I understand his shortcomings were plenty but at the same time, he led the charge to revitalize Siberia. A project, as we can see from what little news trickles in from the east, has bared fruit"\n\nArvids tightened his grip on the podium, his knuckles turning white, "I will capitulate to you on that point. Comrade Bukharin made great strides in breathing life into the dead east. However, I should not have to remind you where we are and how we ended up not in the Soviet Union of old, but in this new one. It is simply a matter of sustainability. Long term vs short term. The socialist struggle cannot end at Siberia or Russia proper. It must continue on, not remain stagnant!"

His father had died in Sevastopol, his mother in the chaos of the West Russian War, his brother and nephew's to a bout of tuberculosis that had hit their village not three years prior.\n\nHow was sitting at a desk, looking over the same plan's his fellows had already analysed and scrutinized three or four times by now going to avenge any of them? If he was honest with himself, he didn't know. But he was a member of the Communist party precisely for that reason. The higher ups knew what they were talking about, and if they wanted the plans checked thrice to ensure nothing within them threatened the revolution that was exactly what Vladimir would do.\n\nAn icy smile appeared on his face. Who knew after all, perhaps he would live to see the Germans humbled."

 suslov.13.d:0 "Talgat Gaziev wasn't a really important man. Oh he'd risen to the rank of Executive Secretary of his Primary Party Organisation for sure, but that wasn't much of a claim to boast about when said PPO only contained about 20 people, less than a thousandth of the greater membership of the Communist Party in Komi. Yet he did his work well, tried to take satisfaction in it when orders from the parties higher ups came down.\n\nRight now for instance, he'd been delegated to grant a series of awards to high performing members of the peasantry, mostly for services to socialism and the like. Apparently the party leadership was trying to emphasise their contributions to the survival of true communism or something. Talgat didn't really care, he had a job to do.\n\nThe people standing in the uneven line to his side, facing the cameras were an odd bunch. A mix of young women and elderly men for the most part, many stoney faced and scarred by years of hard labour in service of what they believed in. A young boy as well, apparently he'd single handedly stopped a fire which nearly reached a grain silo. As Talgat handed the boy his medal, he gave him a slight pat on the shoulder and assured him that the Party was proud of what he'd done. The sight of the smiling boy with his burn scarred face wouldn't visit Talgat in his dreams that night. But when he awoke he made sure to write a note to the Party higher ups to put him on the fast track for promotion within the party when he came of age anyway."

 suslov.14.d:0 ""Gold. How many blood was spilt for a metal that has barely any use in anything that isn't jewelry or electronics."\n\nArvids Pelshe was sitting in his chair, thinking about the measures that could strengthen the ruble. Main reason why monetary reform even started is to make ruble viable for outside trade, and in order to do this it should be as stable as it possibly can. Oldest method in economics book is to peg the currency to our gold reserves, which are scarce, but it should be enough to stabilize the prices. Next step is to establish a fixed exchange rate, mainly to avoid possible machinations and prevent inflation that it may cause. It was near midnight, but something didn't let Pelshe to fall asleep. Will his efforts to strengthen the ruble worth it? In the end money will lose all it's value, as Soviet industry grows more organized the more people will recognize money as what it is: a paper with ink on it.\n\nNo. In fifty years or so it will become a reality, he was sure about that, but right now there's no means to ensure the safe transition to moneyless society. But every step we take make the day when it will become a real possibility closer and closer."

 suslov.15.d:0 "The students gathered together in the school library, at the same spot in the back as every other school day. It was their own private little space away from the commotion of the classes to work on their greatest assignment yet; to study the ideas and explore the thoughts of the revolutionary father of Russia, Vladimir Lenin.\n\nFor young Kliment though, it was a slog. A constant, endless slog of reading dozens of long, winding tomes going on and on about the roles of the vanguard party, the establishment of the proletariats' dictatorship, etcetera etcetera. Most exhausting of all though was the man himself. From his birth in Simbirsk to his life in Saint Petersburg to his many imprisonments and his advocation for a continent wide revolution in the First World War... At least the October Revolution was coming up soon in their studies, so he could read up on a bit of action.\n\nThere were two reasons driving Kliment to stay diligent in his studies and not slack off, the first being his friends. They were into communism far more than he was and they were much more invested into this assignment, but they made Kliment laugh, they goofed around with him, they played pranks on each other, but most of all, they made him feel whole. And when school ended and he said his brief goodbyes to them 'til the next day, he'd have only one thing on his mind.\n\nIndeed, the young teen cared little for the old Bolshevik, and yet he was the greatest reason he worked so hard in his studies. His family was one marred by strife; from a father struck down by the Germans in the western war, to cousins and old family friends torn away during their conquest, in the end he was left with only a drunken uncle, traumatized by loss. He'd return only to find a sobbing mess on the couch, who'd immediately embrace him once he stepped inside. His uncle had turned to the ideals of Lenin when all else was lost to him; all else but Kliment. When his uncle learned he was now studying the man himself, his joy at the news was the first time Kliment could remember him truly being happy. And he knew he couldn't disappoint his family; his only family."

When Roman was seven he went to the local school and showed his talent for technical sciences - mostly math and basics of physics. Out of almost a hundred applicants, Roman was one of the first - a technical school for him was a chance - to improve himself, to help his family and his country.\n\n"Most of you don't know how it works or about its place in a factory. But that's the reason why you come here, right? So, let's start with the basics."\n\nRoman's hand got tired after writing all the functions of a lathe, main elements of it, and many more to his notebook. That machine looked like something out of this world, a centerpiece of a song of steel and fire. And their teacher said that a factory in Plesetsk has dozen of machines just like that! Roman was listening to every word of the lecture, trying to write down every small detail.

The lecture hall was practically overflowing with students, brought there both by interest and a hefty promotional campaign by the government, always interested in showcasing its scientific progress. The room was buzzing with excitement and potential as Semyonov took the stage.\n\n"First of all, I'd like to thank you all for coming here. Even your presence shows how far we have come as a people. My generation had hardships of our own, but for you, who never knew a Russia that was not at war, to have achieved so much with all that was against you is truly remarkable. Your generation, the chemists and engineers, writers and artists, scientists and scholars in so many other fields, will be the ones who bring the Soviet people back onto the world stage with aplomb. My generation was unable to keep the Union together. Yours will make it the pride of the entire world, so long as you keep working and striving to be better than the day before."\n\nSemyonov went on for slightly under an hour, constantly having to ask the audience to restrain their applause.

Production and industry led Russia through a modern kind of warfare, and collectivization freed the peasants and the poor of Russia.\n\nAnd yet, Suslov knew there was still a long way to go. The Siberian government stands in the way of revolution and true communism, oppressing the workers and farmers alike. Meanwhile, the Germans sit waiting in Europe, murdering and enslaving those who oppose them. The Japanese as well occupy much of the Far East, including Vladivostok, stealing from Russians and occupying Russian industry and resources.\n\nAll opposed Suslov's Russia, and all had to be defeated.

And oftentimes, American fire support and air cover won them the day in a number of battles.\n\nHowever, firepower was not everything. Many hit and run engagements proved costly.

 NIK_gumilyov_regional.1.d:0 "Lev Gumilyov pondered the great Eurasians that had come before him: Genghis Khan, Tamerlan, Yekaterina. They had many things in common, but the most important was their understanding of power. They demanded complete obedience in their subjects and didn't suffer anyone to question their rule. That was the only way to harness the indomitable spirit of the Eurasian nation, and if he was ever to pick up the mantle of those great rulers, he had to demand the same.\n\nThat was, of course, the purpose of the reorganization of the administration. The Passionaryy had done a commendable job getting him this far, but it was time to relieve them of their administrative burden. A loyal bureaucracy would enforce his will over the provinces, and leave the Passionaryy free to continue their most important work: To educate the Eurasian people on their past and to erase the legacy of petty regionalisms and tribal nations.""

Only the most extraordinary of wills could tame and harness the indomitable spirit of great Eurasia. Lev Gumilyov possessed such a will. The implementation of a new economic plan would take him one step closer to his goal. All sectors of the economy had to be organized to take direction from the state. It was a necessary prerequisite to achieve the twin goals of economic modernization and popular mobilization.\n\nDramatically increasing state interference would make him few friends in the higher classes, of course. He had long since been resigned to that fact and his willingness to pay the price of their scorn was set long ago. He would have to deal decisively with the upper crust sooner or later anyway. Far too often, the poison of disunity could be traced back to some plutocrat seeking to profit from chaos. If he allowed industries to operate outside state control, perfidious owners would undermine Eurasia to seek those profits, for themselves or in service to tribalist traitors."

He was met by the all too familiar sight of their commander riding towards him. The integration of Captain Akhmetov's cavalry was proving a difficult task, mostly due to the man's complete lack of experience with protocol and poor grasp of the Russian language. Still, the higher-ups were adamant on the value of mounted soldiers and insisted the new company's "steppe instincts" would yield valuable insights once attuned to the realities of modern combat. Andreyev was not convinced.\n\n"Colonel Andrev?"\n\n"What is it this time, Captain?"\n\n"We should go home. It will rain soon and the ground here, it will be very bad for your cars. Soft. Too soft"\n\nSomething about the sincerity of the man compelled the Colonel to consider his advice. The exercise was, after all, on the Tatars home turf, not his. And he was glad he did. No sooner had he moved his men than the sky parted, as torrential rain poured down over the exercise field. As the rest of the company tried desperately to keep dry in their defensive positions, Akhmetov had his riders keep scouting their enemies, trusting his men to find good footing in between the muddy fields. In the days after, when the rains had ended, Andreyev had every advantage he needed to emerge from the exercise as the clear victor."
