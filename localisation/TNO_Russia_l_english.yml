 raiding.13.t:0 "음식 도난"
 raiding.13.d:0 "오늘 아침 도적과 범죄자들이 우리 식량 보급품을 약탈한 것을 발견했습니다. 최소 세 곳에서 곡물, 고기, 소금, 통조림을 보관하고 있던 창고가 약탈당했습니다. 남은 것은 엎어진 보릿자루 몇 개와 먹을 수 없게 된 고기 통조림 몇 개뿐이었습니다. 아이들은 배를 곯으며 잠자리에 들고 농부들은 사람들을 먹여 살리기 위해 분투합니다. 몇 주만 지나면 사람들이 먹을 것을 얻기 위해 서로에게 총을 겨눌 겁니다. 뭔가 해야 합니다."

 raiding.14.t:0 "도살당한 주둔군"
 raiding.14.d:0 "오늘 아침은 죽음과 패배의 소식과 함께 시작되었습니다. 도적 약탈자들이 우리 막사를 짓밟았습니다. 우리 주둔군은 소름 끼치고 끔찍한 방법으로 살해당해 흙밭에 버려졌습니다. 벽은 피와 뇌 조각으로 범벅이 되었고 병사 침실에서는 빛나는 연기가 피어오릅니다. 습격자들의 순수히 악의와 잔인함만으로 이런 짓을 벌였습니다. 우리 인력은 큰 피해를 보았습니다. 놈들은 어딘가로 사라졌습니다. 국경 지대에 부는 바람이 손짓합니다. [Root.GetName] 사람들은 공포 속에서 고개를 숙입니다. 최대한 빨리 그 야만인들에 대항해 뭐라도 해야 합니다."
 raiding.14.a:0 "전사자를 매장하고, 유족들에게 알리도록..."

 raiding.15.d:0 "우리 영토에 벌어진 습격에 대해 최신 보고가 올라왔습니다. 다행히도 우리 민간인 대부분은 무사했습니다. 하지만 산업 생산은 그렇지 못했습니다. 공장 장비들이 약탈당했고 많은 시설이 화재로 소실되었습니다. 산업 발전이 크게 후퇴했습니다. 현재 우리 생산량을 효과적으로 증대시킬 방법은 없습니다. 하지만 우리 사람들을 지킬 수는 있습니다. 기계는 잃어도 되찾을 수 있지만, 생명은 그렇지 못하니까요."
 raiding.15.a:0 "개새끼들!"
 
 raiding.16.t:0 "약탈당한 병기창"
 raiding.16.d:0 "장군들이 우리가 소유한 무기고 몇 곳이 도적들에게 약탈당했다고 보고했습니다. 보고에 따르면 소총과 탄약이 사라졌습니다. 몇몇 무기고는 모든 물품을 도난당했습니다. 놈들은 하룻밤 사이에 사라졌습니다. 놈들은 우리 국경 지대를 오래전에 통과한 것 같습니다. 우리 창고는 비었습니다. 놈들을 막을 무기가 갈수록 부족해질 것입니다. 뭔가 해야 합니다. 그렇지 않으면 곧 우리 목숨도 도둑맞을 것입니다."
 raiding.16.a:0 "이건 놈들 기운만 북돋아 줄 뿐이야..."

 raiding.17.d:0 "폐허가 된 국경 마을에서 보고를 받았습니다. 우리 사람들이 도륙당하고 우리 산업이 파괴되었습니다. 국경을 너머 습격해온 도적들은 분명 강력하며 야만적인 놈들이었을겁니다. 그렇지 않는다면 우리 방위군을 몰살시키고 우리 사람들을 두들겨팼을리가 없습니다. 집, 마을회관, 작업장에서 백여구의 시체가 발견되었습니다. 생존자들은 습격에 대해 말하며 공포에 몸을 떨었습니다. 도적의 공격을 효과적으로 막을 수 없게 되었습니다. 이 분쟁 지역을 통치하는 능력에 심각한 피해가 갔습니다. 지금이 우리가 제일 나약해진 순간입니다. 분노를 실어 반격하려면 먼저 무슨 수를 써서라도 살아남아 회복해야 합니다."

 RUS.8.desc:0 "사샤는 폭격으로 박살 난 오두막의 잔해 옆에 앉아 기다렸다. 그녀의 귀는 파편에 찢겨나가 있었다. 그녀는 사냥꾼과 함께 사냥감을 쫓던 순간을 떠올렸다. 얼마나 즐거운 시간이었던가! 하지만 이제는 모든 것이 사라졌다. 낡은 회색 오두막의 초가지붕은 날아가 버렸고, 벽 너머에서 들려오던 웃음과 취기 어린 농담은 죽은 침묵이 되었다. 머리 위로 높게 뻗은 소나무 숲은 인간과 함께 있었을 때 누렸던 따뜻함도 안락함도 주지 못했다. 그녀는 공터에 드러누웠다. 머리 위에 우거진 잎사귀들을 보는 것도 두려웠다. 단지 시골로 달려가고 싶을 뿐이었다. 하지만 사샤는 동료들을 믿고 있었다. 그들이 다시 돌아와 옛날처럼 같이 사냥을 나갈 것이었다.\n\n해가 뜨고 졌다. 밤이 오고 갔다. 그녀가 잘 때, 그녀가 덤불 속으로 도망친 작은 동물을 쫓아 나갈 때, 그녀가 자신 없어 하며 사라진 친구들을 찾으려 할 때 소나무의 눈이 그녀를 지켜보았다. 빽빽한 덤불 밑에는 해로워 보이는 다른 동물들, 한때 그녀가 사냥했던 사냥감들, 그리고 이상한 냄새를 풍기는 낯선 사람이 있었다. 그녀는 전율했다. 이 땅에 그녀 혼자만이 남아있었다. 그녀는 두 번째 새벽에 눈을 뜨고 네 발로 일어나 자리를 떴다. 여전히 그녀는 동료들을 다시 만나고 숲의 동물들이 다시 그녀를 두려워할 게 될 거라고 믿고 있었다. 하지만 살아남는 게 제일 중요했다. 그녀는 숲속으로 걸어 들어갔다. 소나무들은 가능한 높은 것에서 알 수 없는 목적을 가지고 그녀를 내려다보았다."

 RUS.9.desc:0 "블라디미르는 불붙인 담배를 물고는 숨을 들이쉬었다. 따뜻한 연기가 폐를 채우자 그는 안도의 한숨을 내뱉었다. 좋다고 할 수는 없지만, 이걸로도 충분했다. 그는 겨우 한 달 전에 단체에 가입했었다. 담배가 분해될 거라는 생각은 못 했다. 어떤 공장 노동자가 담배를 잘못 만게 틀림없었다. "젠장." 그는 혼잣말을 내뱉었다. "담배 하나 정말 좆같네." 그는 담뱃불을 발로 짓뭉개 껐다. 음. 혼자 순찰 돌면서 담배를 피우다니. 그는 몸을 떨었다. 손이 점점 풀리고 있었지만 차가운 아침 공기는 그를 아직도 보내주지 않았다. 곧 아침이 된다. 그는 편히 드러누웠다.\n\n그의 등 뒤에서 잔가지가 부러지는 소리가 들렸다. 그는 돌아서서 소총을 겨누었다. 숨을 참으며 침입자가 그를 순식간에 찢어버릴 거라고 생각했다. 나온 것은 왼쪽 귀가 없는 개 한 마리였다. "개 같네. 괜히 겁먹었잖아." 그는 땀을 닦았다. 개는 신기한 듯이 그를 쳐다보았다. 그는 무기를 집어넣고 천천히 다가갔다. 개는 블라디미르를 무서워해 하지 않았다. 그건 확실했다. "길 잃었니? 내가 대체 무슨 말을 하는 거람. 넌 개인데." 그는 개의 거친 털에 손을 올려 부드럽게 두들겼다. 개는 느긋하게 있다가 블라디미르가 멈추자 저 멀리 걸어갔다.\n\n블라디미르는 개가 푸른 아침 하늘 속으로 사라질 때까지 지켜보았다. 그는 앉아 한숨을 내쉬었다. 그는 돛대를 꺼내 불을 붙였다. 이번에는 분해되지 않도록 조심했다. 어떻게 보면 러시아의 모두는 개와 같았다. 그는 약탈자, 민간인, 노동자, 보초를 떠올렸다. 모두 무언가를 잃었다. 그는 그 사실을 아주 뼈저리게 느꼈다. 러시아는 집이 아니었다. 러시아는 쾌적한 곳도 아니었다. 러시아가 준 것은 알 수 없는 잔혹함과 이해할 수 없는 생활이었다. 하지만 그는 언젠가 저 개처럼 집을, 있을 곳을 찾을 것이다. 그는 담배를 다 태우고는 떠오르는 해를 보았다."

 RUS.10.t:0 "New Friends"
 RUS.10.desc:0 "Sasha walked through the woods, keeping her head down in case the eyes of the trees looked at her. She hunted a pair of rabbits and managed to find a tin of dog food, opened and unspoiled. She strolled along the countryside, happy that her stomach was humming along with delight. The sky was overcast, and it looked like it might rain at any moment. The arms of the pines reached out, expectant. Sasha wondered where she should take cover, as the clouds were at the precipice of a deluge. She walked on, thinking that she would find it, wherever she went.\n\n"We won't find anything to eat if this keeps up," she heard a deep voice say, "if your tracking keeps on being this bad." "Shut up!" came the reply, evidently from a younger man, "What the hell did you expect? I'm no tracker. I'm the son of a fa-" "Yeah, yeah. Just keep on looking." She came near them and looked at them. They were two men bent on the end of a deer trail. "If only Dmitri didn't die, we wouldn't be stuck with you-" the old man noticed Sasha, and stopped. She met his eyes, and he didn't look evil at all. He reached into his pocket. Two beef jerky's proceeded out. "What are you doing?" "Shh." He threw them in front of her. She smelt them and was about to devour them before training strained her body straight. The old man said, "Pavel, would you look at that, a trained dog!" and laughed. It had been a long time since Sasha had heard human laughter. He came closer and caressed her neck, gently bringing her to the trail. Pavel picked up the jerky. "Now, do you smell that?" She did. She cantered into the forest, the humans following.\n\nIt's been so long. Her heart ached. She had never been this happy. She remembered the old hut and her friends within. Now she had a home again. Overhead, the sky parted its steel sheets, and the sun shone down on Russia."

 RUS.11.t:0 "A Dog's Life"
 RUS.11.desc:0 "Sergei's stomach grumbled again, the third time today. It had been a few days since he last ate. He was shivering in the afternoon wind, clinging to his thick coat while trying to calm the dull pain in his abdomen. The last time he checked, he had loose skin there. He was losing weight fast. Sergei wasn't stupid; he tried hunting the rabbits, but his shots missed, and when they connected, the bullets riddled his meal with lead. He still remembered the bitter meat and how it made him vomit. The bears towered over him, and he didn't have enough bullets to take them down. The stags seemed to sense his presence and ran too fast for him. His only solace was a pack of cigarettes thrust upon him by the party, as well as some slices of bread he had to ration carefully. He looked down, checking if they were still there.\n\nLeaves rustled in front of him. A dog with a missing left ear stood there, looking at him curiously. His mind sputtered awake at an idea. He put his hand on his pistol and approached the dog slowly. It broke into a gallop after its eyes met his. No, not again, thought Sergei. He knelt and fired. The shot clipped the dog on its hind legs, and it fell. Finally, dinner! He caught up to it to discover it still breathing. It looked up to him pleadingly. "I'm sorry, little one." A final gunshot rang through the air. Sergei stood and took out his knife.\n\nThe pine trees watched as a man butchered a dog. All that happened here were immaterial to them. But as the shadows grow longer and longer, they would turn to see from man and dog, back and forth. As the dusk darkened, their lines blur together, more and more, until the man was no more than a rabid dog, and the dog no lesser than a dead man. To the trees, it seemed strange, odd; but they didn't care. They looked on, still, with indifference."

 RUS.50.t:0 "Eviction Notice"
 RUS.50.desc:0 ""Good day." A middle-aged man eyed Vasily with suspicion from behind horn-rimmed glasses, his figure planted squarely against the doorframe. "I am under obligation to inform you..." A schoolteacher reached for a pad of paper to take notes before realizing that she had none. "...that under the Law on Land and Property Restitution as passed by the Veche of the Russian Republic on 18 December, 1973..." An aging, stolid Bavarian launched into a blistering political tirade, spittle flying in the air, as Vasily nervously eyed the rifle mounted on the wall. "...your residence has been classified as Schedule I Expropriated Land Belonging to the Russian People." A quailing Dutch housewife asked what it all meant in the broken German her husband had taught her.\n\n"Accordingly, in thirty days legal ownership of your house and land will be transferred to its original, prewar owner..." A farmer pleadingly recounted all that he had built on the land, his watching children on the brink of tears in the background. "...and it is advised that you leave the property with all of your possessions by that time." An aging veteran said nothing, but gave Vasily a look of almost-sympathy, as if he somehow understood.\n\n"Please refrain from damaging the property. You will be charged for any damage you do the land prior to your departure." A sobbing construction worker was no longer listening. "The Russian state regrets that this action has to be taken, but believes it to be necessary in order to ensure the just compensation of those who lost property due to the German occupation. An elderly woman stared back at the newest ideologue on her doorstep with blank, almost lifeless eyes.\n\n"Do you have any questions?""

 RUS.200.t:0 "Red October Forevermore"
 RUS.200.desc:0 "Across Russia today, celebration can be heard, as soldiers garbed in old Soviet uniforms, carrying old and scavenged Soviet banners from the times of revolution to the carnage of the Great Patriotic War. It is a new day for Russia, and begets the first time in over two decades that the scarred region seems to stand united in any real purpose, and behind any real cause.\n\nThe reaction from international onlookers to the cheering crowds is mixed, in Europe, many fear the Slavic revenge and the sudden possibility of retribution for their failures in the World War, while in America, many celebrate, leftists heralding this as the pendulum swinging back against the Nazis and Japan.\n\nIn Russia, however, the people are united. Even those who decry the Soviets and Communism can not deny the fact that a united Russia is the only hope the region has had in seemingly a lifetime, and already, many debate what, exactly, the nation shall do now."
 RUS.200.a:0 "What face will the Union put on to the world?"
 RUS.200.b:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

 RUS.201.t:0 "Unity in Russia - Unending"
 RUS.201.desc:0 "The regime of [From.GetRulingParty] and [From.GetLeader] has declared victory in their efforts to reunite the many Russian states today, announcing a new regime of strength and power that will finally throw their enemies back to the depths. Cheering crowds and marching soldiers can be seen in every major population center, with every village at least having one or two drunken militiamen waving the flag of this new union stumbling through its streets.\n\nIt is a new day for Russia, a new regime. The nation has experimented with monarchy, Communism and now, after its greatest defeat, ironically, fascism. Many look in surprise as the Russians seem to have adopted the same ideology as their most hated enemies, but at the same time many others see this as the natural reaction.\n\nTo fight your enemies, they say, you must become the enemy."
 RUS.201.a:0 "When you stare into the abyss..."
 RUS.201.b:0 "The enemies of Russia will fear us!"
 
 RUS.202.t:0 "The Republican Phoenix"
 RUS.202.desc:0 "The Russian Republic was short lived and ended in fire and flames as the revolution claimed it and dragged it screaming into the darkness. Perpetually ineffective, and never having been able to form a stable government, the Republic never seemed to have a proper chance and few seemed to mourn its passing.\n\nThings change, however, and today [From.GetLeader] and his supporters have announced the final preparations for the reunification of the Russian state have finally been completed. A new, modern, Russian Republic will replace the squabbling warlords, and bring unity and justice to the Russian people.\n\nNobody knows, exactly, what the Russians plan. Whether they will seek reconquest or peaceful reintegration has yet to be seen, and the world waits with bated breath."
 RUS.202.a:0 "Well, here's to second chances."
 RUS.202.b:0 "Liberty for all Russians!"
 
 RUS.203.t:0 "A Crown from the Gutter"
 RUS.203.desc:0 "In a grand ceremony in Russia's new capital today, [From.GetLeader] was crowned as Tsar of all Russias today, thousands of cheering citizens and an already growing band of courtiers heralding their new autocrat to their throne.\n\nGenuine surprise seems to pervade the world, a return to the Tsardom being the last thing many expected, but many experts are disagreeing and claiming that this was long expected. Russia's true downfall, after all, seemed to come once the Tsar was overthrown, and autocratic sentiments have survived long into the warlord era.\n\nSurprise or no, however, a Tsar now sits in charge of Russia in all of her vastness, and the people of the nation for the first time in decades have something, or more accurately, someone, to unite behind. While those in the west look at this with approval, Japan and Germany have both begun preparing their armies, fearing that a renewed conflict in Russia will be the breaking point for their empires.\n\nThe only reaction not known is that of the new Tsar, and many wait in fear or anticipation for their first decrees."
 RUS.203.a:0 "Orthodoxy, autocracy, and nationality reign anew."

 RUS.204.t:0 "Strength Eternal"
 RUS.204.desc:0 "[From.GetLeader] and his band of military men have, today, announced the final preparations in the reunification of the Russian nation have finally ended. Televisions across the world show marching soldiers saluting their generals and, often the same men, governors, as cheering crowds welcome the stability and security that the junta have promised them.\n\nRussia is now a nation, but more specifically, they are a military with a nation, [From.GetLeader]'s [From.GetRulingParty] ruling with an iron fist from the top of the chain of command.\n\nWhile the Russians cheer, the reaction internationally is one of confusion and fear. While many welcome an end to the cruelty and banditry that has been endemic to the nation's warlord era for long, behind a single autocratic military leader and his inner circle, Russia is now also a beast to be feared. Already, the Russian military has begun building up to new, modern levels, and [From.GetLeader] seems, from the view of international observers, ready to use it."
 RUS.204.a:0 "This can only bring further conflict."
 RUS.204.b:0 "Enemies of Russia, fear us!"

 RUS.205.t:0 "The Great Journey Begins"
 RUS.205.desc:0 "Today in Russia, [From.GetLeader] has been declared spiritual leader of the Russian peoples, effectively centralizing his role as the master of the entire region. A prayer service held in every church across Russia was followed by widespread celebration into the night as the leader of the newly united nation became the first in the region to have a televised and radio broadcast from the Urals to the Pacific.\n\nFor those many villagers without access to either, their own spiritual leaders and local military governors have read off his speech themselves.\n\nNobody knows what is next for the new theocratic administration. Some seem to believe that the [From.GetRulingParty] will bring the faith to those within the borders, but others fear the holy legions will march abroad, or begin their own spiritual crusade against their former enemies."
 RUS.205.a:0 "Let us hope this new regime learns moderation."
 RUS.205.b:0 "Our holy father will bring us to glory!"
 
 RUS.206.t:0 "The Black March Begins"
 RUS.206.desc:0 "The black flag flies in Russia today, soldiers marching out the last 'traitors' to Russia, several alleged German and Japanese spies included, and on international television, executed them to cheering crowds of Russians.\n\n[From.GetLeader] and the [From.GetRulingParty] declared that they would be the first on Russia's long journey to face the wraith of the Russian people for their evils during the World War.\n\nAlready, Commissars have visited each village and town and have begun the process of bringing every eligible man into what many are calling the Black Legions, for their dark uniforms and the flags they bear, and there seems to be talk of even bringing women into these legions as well.\n\nThe new state has said little of their economy, nothing on industry besides its use as a tool for war, and seem to care little about the rights or freedoms of their people. What they have talked about, and in great detail, is the utter annihilation of Russia's enemies, and the people seem to be welcoming this in open arms. In public, at least."
 RUS.206.a:0 "There is no way that this will end well."
 RUS.206.b:0 "One final war, one final victory!"
 
 RUS.207.t:0 "The Swastika Eternal"
 RUS.207.desc:0 "For a long time, Russia has become known for being a sinkhole regarding news; everything goes in, almost nothing comes out. And whatever comes out usually does via the rumor mill. The recent announcement by [From.GetLeader], however, has shocked the world.\n\nThe Aryan Brotherhood, long thought to be just a bad rumor, has made its existence and its power known throughout the entire world, via reaching out towards Russia and unifying it beneath its iron grip. Swastikas adorn every town as the Brotherhood's leadership deliberates on how best to extend its doctrines over the large territory they acquired.\n\nRumours still spread, as some even say that the Brotherhood may be willing to turn on the Reich it allegedly idolizes should it become weak enough, given their belief that Aryanhood can be acquired, and thus, lost as well. Allegedly, should the Reich decline enough, the Brotherhood's leadership may claim that the mantle of True Aryanhood will pass on their shoulders, and Germany must be brought to heel as a result.\n\nRegardless of the Brotherhood's intentions, most observers have reacted with shock and horror when analyzing the new Russia, and can only pray that it either becomes more benevolent or collapses soon..."

 RUS.999.d:0 "For a long time, daily life in the remnants of Russia not protected by the Urals has been defined by the ruthless Luftwaffe bombing campaign. Many Russian citizens grew used to hearing the engines of the German airplanes and the plunge of their deadly payloads. Yet, something changed recently. Many Russian citizens just had a good night's sleep, then as they woke up and went on their daily routine, they noticed that the whole day passed without the bombings. A day that then turned into a week... Whoever had access to radio networks and some grasp of German confirmed the rumors; the Germans collapsed into civil war, and the bombings will not be returning any time soon. For many people, this is a relief, as it allows them to start rebuilding more properly, however in the halls of power, this is an opportunity to more properly deal with their enemies, once and for all."

 RUS.100.desc:0 "It was a cold, cold day in Siberia, as it always was. Snow covered the ground, hiding dirt that had never seen the sun deep below, and never would. As Artyom marched through it in boots and furs, a bundle of birds in one hand and his rifle in the other, he looked at the clouds above. They looked darker than normal, a sure sign of a storm.\n\nShrugging off the snow from his furs and leathers, he approached his ramshackle hut and slowly opened the door, carefully placing his items down on a table nearby.\n\nAfter a quiet moment of contemplation as he remarked over his quiet abode and lit his lamp, he scratched his dog, Sasha, behind the ear and turned on the radio as he did everyday, and frowned as he got nothing besides static.\n\nArtyom quickly started surfing through the few stations he reached, and found nothing but static, static, and more static. After some time, he shrugged, he had expected the old tilting radio tower near the equally dilapidated village to collapse for days now, nothing could be done. The outside world, and all of its wonders, were nothing but a distant thought for Artyom, and after a sigh, he turned off the radio for the last time."

The last few remaining independent councilmen have been drowned out by some of the first unified voices the Communes have ever seen.\n\n The free-thinking and independent people of Orenburg would grumble and complain, but compared to the might of the resurgent Russian powers a few irate farmers were a paltry concern.\n\n At the end of the day, the councilmen would return home and grumble and the world would move on without them."

Konstantin had been hearing more and more rumors filter down from above, liaisons dictating more and more of what the League does. Even this posting had come down from the liaison's office.\n\n Konstantin has been a part of the League since its beginnings in the flight from Vorkuta, he led men in the war against Dirliwanger, and he had been instrumental in the training of Orenburg's militia.

He could only be thankful that his orders had changed recently.\n\n The rising powers of Russia had turned hungry eyes towards the Southern Urals. Economic aid flooded the region, new roads and rail lines were built for the first time in decades, new factories were opened, and the lives of those under the gaze of the Mountain knew a markedly better existence than that of before.\n\n Of course, with these economic incentives came political meddling. At first the influence was minor, a change of policy here and there, but now it was clear that the Black Mountain was shackled to their benefactors. More often than not, Andrei got his orders from men outside his chain of command. Even this patrol, as minor as it was, came down to outside influence.\n\n As he walked past another shuttered house, Andrei could not help but be thankful. With things as they were, it would not have been long before he was liquidated for his doubts and regrets. Now, the simple mundanity of patrolling the Urals calmed him.\n\n Andrei finally looked to his partner, Alexei. He was a better man than most, though not a good man-- none of them could lie and call themselves good men. They had stopped at the edge of the village, away from fearful eyes and judging glares.

It was a demand that went against everything the people of the Communes believed in, and yet there was real debate on the Chamber floor about which way to go. For once, the council members were united into only three factions. There were those who wished to give in, to accept the -- admittedly tempting-- benefits and abandon the status quo, and there were also those who would not settle for simple bribes to abandon their hard fought freedoms.\n\n The third faction, those that sat on the fence, would be the deciding factor in the overall decision of the Council. After many hours of shouting, and more than one attempt for either parties to get violent, the third party made their declaration.\n\n As the representative from the third faction stood up the Council hall fell silent, the man stood at the head of his group and spoke: "We have decided that the Communes of Orenburg should...""

He remembered the old days, the days when the hammer and sickle flew proudly in every city in the Union. He remembered the oppression, the brutality, and the death. He remembered being carted to Vorkuta along with hundreds of others to be worked until they froze.

Around him, their tongues wagged freely, and he soaked up the gossip like a sponge.\n\n "I hear the bosses are in talks with the fascists. They have demanded our subjugation, or so I hear.

I heard it was the Revolutionary Front, or those Black League maniacs," came the voice of another.\n\n "And I heard it was the ghost of Comrade Bukharin, risen again to wreak havoc against the Germans," came Dimitri's voice.

Despite their ragtag nature, they were loyal and very well disciplined.\n\n At the moment, Nikolai's men watched as an NKVD man from the Black Mountain patrolled the village below. Even from so far away he could feel the man's nerves, something was going on and it was nothing good. He had heard all he needed of the Black Mountain to despise its rulers, but he also understood the necessity of taking control of the region --even if he would prefer to storm the Mountain and kill every NKVD bastard within.\n\n The subject of the man's nerves quickly became apparent when the screaming started. He could see men in a different uniform, a very familiar uniform, moving in on the village from the South.

Not only because whatever the hell they're doing in there will continue, but because it makes a massive war extremely likely.\n\nNow, the sensible thing to do would be to back down. A war isn't good, especially one that we may lose. Taking our time, getting to full strength, and preparing for the war would be a better idea. A sudden action that is taken without thought could destroy all that we have built and strived for.\n\nThe moral thing to do would be to send our army to crush this maggot that crawled out of the corpse of the Soviet Union, and anyone who wants to defend the crimes they have committed.

Instead they advocate for our own intervention in response. With the armies of the southern Urals already busy fighting our rival we would be free to sweep in and capture most or possibly even all of the southern Urals.

We tried to do things peacefully, but it seems reuniting Russia requires yet more Russian blood be spilled. We can only hope this new struggle will be more civilized than those we have already fought."

Our intelligence officers have just reported that our rival has decided to abandon the city to its fate and not risk a military confrontation. Their hope that guaranteeing the independence of the Polish state would deter us from pursuing annexation were proven wrong when we did not back down from our plans. Once they realized we would not be bullied into submission their bold posturing quickly collapsed. Our rival has proven to be unwilling to back big words with big actions, and the way is clear to take Nowa Polska peacefully or by force. Now that they know they will face us alone, the Polish state has one last chance to accept peaceful annexation. If they would rather perish than go quietly, we are more than happy to oblige them."
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.31.a:0 "Right into our hands."

 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.32.t:0 "Nowa Polska Surrenders!"
 RUS_race_to_kazakhstan.32.d:0 "It seems that wisdom has finally prevailed in Central Asia. After being abandoned by our rival and left to fend for themselves, the communes of Nowa Polska have accepted our final offer for peaceful annexation. Realizing they could not hope to stand against our vastly superior army, the government of Nowa Polska decided that subjugation was preferable to suicide. The Polish state will now be annexed into our nation and integration efforts can begin. Despite how many in Nowa Polska feel, there is no dishonor in this decision. By avoiding war they have spared the lives of thousands and the incalculable destruction another war would have brought to Central Asia. After decades of violence and madness, stability will finally return to Nowa Polska."

Despite making it abundantly clear that this was Nowa Polska's final chance to accept and avoid an armed conflict, they have still refused all our advances, saying if we wish to enslave them we must do so by force. Even after being abandoned by our rival and left to fend for themselves, the people of Nowa Polska still refuse to see reason. They have no chance against our superior numbers and firepower. Perhaps they believe their dedication to freedom will be enough to overcome us. They are incredibly mistaken, as we will soon show them. When it is all over they cannot say we didn't try to do things the nice way. Perhaps it is fitting that a region known to be even more violent and chaotic than the rest of Russia will require one last war to be pacified."

With the current struggle for influence over Nowa Polska and Central Asia, a show of force is not surprising, but our generals warn that this seems much more serious than that. In recent days more and more units have arrived at our borders and are stationing themselves in what seem to be predetermined positions. At this point it seems certain that one of our neighbors has given up on diplomacy and is preparing to invade! We must mobilize the army of Nowa Polska and prepare the people for war. Time is short and we have been caught off guard. Our only hope is to persuade the rival of the aggressor to come to our defence. If they answer the call we may be able to keep some measure of freedom for Nowa Polska. Hopefully they are more ready for a fight than we are."

Our forces have consistently underperformed in the battle across the steppes, and more and more elements within our society are calling for anything from a temporary ceasefire, to an armistice, to a full-on peace treaty and removal of our government for "dragging them into this blunder". Whilst removing our government is, of course, a pipe dream, we must consider bringing this war to a close as quickly as possible, lest public disapproval further spiral out of control and bring drastic consequences upon our heads."

 ### Finland Diplo ###
 russiadiplo.37.t:0 "The Viipuri Conference"
 russiadiplo.37.desc:0 "In its short existence, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Finland had rarely been inactive. Orbiting our former overlords in the east as we do, diplomacy has always had its place as the shield of our young nation. The Soviet war of aggression in the thirties had been feared, and diplomats had spent their entire careers trying to prepare for it. Now, the era of Russian unification has set a new crisis into motion.\n\nOnce merely one of many risible "government of national unity" , our opponent now stands on the border of our forward line in Onega. Every possible regional rival has been vanquished. Now this unifier has come for the last few pieces of Russian land in western Russia that is not directly shielded by the Germans. And they'll want it quickly, for our military analysts predict the rise of threatening rivals in Siberia and the Far East. The logic of unification demands that the government of western Russia plucks every low hanging fruit as quickly as possible.\n\nRather than use blunt force, this new western Russian state seeks to enter into talks with our government, and has proposed that a conference take place in Viipuri, Karelia. It is perhaps a mercy that this jumped up war band prefers diplomacy. But no amount of words can change the strategic situation that Finland stands alone, that our military buffer zone in Onega shields our population and industry from warfare, and that abandoning it without a fight might invite our future subjugation by Ivan. The Russian's bluster of a massive army crashing onto us does not change the fact that their army is equipped with scraps of decaying Soviet equipment, while ours is modern and well armed. This might be our best and only chance to delay or prevent the formation of a hostile government on our doorstep.\n\nIn the halls of the foreign ministry, there is constant dialogue. Hawks demand a general mobilization order. Doves beg the government to make use of this reprieve to open dialogue with the Russians and see what they desire. No matter our decision, the Russian ambassador waits wordlessly. He probably already knows what course of action we intend to choose."
 russiadiplo.37.a:0 "We must open diplomacy. What do they want?"
 russiadiplo.37.b:0 "We can't give them what they want. Prepare the mobilization order."

 russiadiplo.38.t:0 "Finland Refuses All Negotiations"
 russiadiplo.38.desc:0 "It was perhaps inevitable that the Finns would refuse. The government of Finland isn't staffed by fools; the same reasons why our government desires Onega back are the reasons why they refuse to return it. Both of our nations desire to hold strategic ground that might prove essential in any future war between Russia and Germany, or between Russia and Finland. The Finnish generals remember the first winter war, where the Red Army eventually overran the Mannerheim line on the Karelian isthmus.\n\nA more bloodthirsty government than ours might have not bothered with diplomacy. If we cannot convince the Finns to see reason, then we can punish them for their perfidy. They have seen fit to enslave Russians for its protection, to hide in the shadow of the German hegemon. We will weep for the brave men of Onega, forced into servitude by cowardly Finns. But we shall shed no tears for Onega's backers in Helsinki."
 russiadiplo.38.a:0 "War it is then."

 russiadiplo.39.t:0 "Finland Requests Our Terms"
 russiadiplo.39.desc:0 "The Finns are somewhat receptive to talks. Our ambassador informs us that Helsinki has agreed to a high level diplomatic conference between our two nations.\n\nIt is pleasing that the Finns have not done anything rash, and have agreed to at least give us some time to make demands. Some cynics in our government suspect Helsinki of merely stalling for time to order a full mobilization. The fact remains that war can be avoided. Before anything else, however, Helsinki wants to know our terms.\n\nOnega must be returned to us, its population freed from their janissary duty for Finland. That much is essential. This does not mean, however, that the Russo-Finnish frontier should remain a dagger pointed at Finland's heart. We could simply demilitarize Onega, and sign a nonaggression pact for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Finns would probably accept such a deal, and Helsinki would likely see it as too good to be true... Thus, a better deal would be the return of Onega in full, with our troops in the region. Eastern Karelia will be also be integrated to Russia as an autonomous region, with the Finns granted an open border into the region. This would return to us the arctic port of Murmansk. South-western Karelia and its critical city of Vyborg, or Viipuri in Finnish, would stay under Helsinki's control. Demilitarized zones and non-aggression treaties will follow, preventing any future war between our peoples.\n\nOf course, we could just demand it all. No matter how attached the Finns are to Vyborg and south-western Karelia, their paltry army cannot save them for long. Onega's ramshackle mob of conscripts will not slow us long, if they choose to fight their countrymen at all. The Finns will agree to our demands for Onega and all of Karelia, or pay for their arrogance."
 russiadiplo.39.a:0 "We merely want our people and Onega back."
 russiadiplo.39.b:0 "We want the the Russian majority territories."

 russiadiplo.40.t:0 "Russia Requests Onega's Return"
 russiadiplo.40.desc:0 "Sighs of relief could be heard today in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as the Russian reply came in. Russia wants Onega back, and is willing to keep it demilitarized as a sign of good faith. A treaty of non-aggression would be signed after the territorial exchange, and peace will be the order of the day between Russia and Finland. No mention has been made of eastern Karelia, nor of the critically important city of Viipuri.\n\nWe would be fools to refuse this offer. However, some in our army still insist that there must be a trick to the Russian offer, and that none of their generals have forgotten the shame of the Winter War and the humiliation of Finnish control over Onega. The Russians expect an answer rapidly, and so we must accept or reject this magnanimous proposal."
 russiadiplo.40.a:0 "We accept the offer."
 russiadiplo.40.b:0 "We reject the offer."

 russiadiplo.41.t:0 "Russia Requests Muurmanni"
 russiadiplo.41.desc:0 "As expected, Russia wants sovereignty over Onega back. They also require us to give them back the Kola Penninsula, home to the Arctic port of Murmansk. To accommodate for Finnish population in the region, this land would be integrated into a new Karelian Autonomous Zone, sharing an open border with Finland and a minimal security presence. The borders of our nations would be demilitarized, and a treaty of non-aggression would guarantee a return to peaceful relations. Additionally, the rest of Karelia will be given limited autonomy under a Finnish administration, with military access and open borders to both Finland and Russia.\n\nAbandoning Kola and Muurmanni is seen as a bridge too far by many in our nation. This is a great deal of land, and many of our citizens have moved there and call it home. Refusing this deal might thus be in our best interests; the Russians might then reduce their demands to Onega if fate smiles on us."
 russiadiplo.41.a:0 "Tell the Russians that Muurmani is ours."
 russiadiplo.41.b:0 "We can't risk it. Muurmani must be abandoned."

 russiadiplo.42.t:0 "Russia Requests Karelia!"
 russiadiplo.42.desc:0 "The Russian demands were laid out during the conference, and are widely seen in Helsinki as a bad joke. Couched in diplomatic formulas is the demand for all of Karelia to return to Russian ownership. Viipuri, our second greatest city, would be peacefully given to the Russians. Hundreds of thousands of Finnish citizens would have to be evacuated, and at least one quarter of our industrial base would be given to the Russians. This would be quite generous of us, considering the miserable failure of Red Army attempts to capture the city during the Winter War.\n\nThe Russian demands are no joke, however, for they are quite insistent that these demands must be accepted or rejected in their entirety. These demands for the peaceful drawing and quartering of Finland are too insane to contemplate."
 russiadiplo.42.a:0 "Prepare for war, and expel the Russian negotiators."

 russiadiplo.43.t:0 "Finland Denies Our Offer"
 russiadiplo.43.desc:0 "The Finns have a reputation for being a dour, silent people. Today, their whimsical sense of humor was on display as the negotiators of the Republic of Finland argued that the people of Onega have a right to independence and self-determination. Freed from their puppet master's strings, these unfortunate Onegan civilians now desire nothing more than an end to Russian bullying, according to the Finnish negotiator's logic. This backwater of a backwater Russian province, we're being told, has long aspired to fly free on the international stage as its own nation.\n\nIf the Finns had no interest in diplomatic talks; they could have simply told us so. Now as our negotiators head home, our generals are receiving their orders. We are going to have to do this the hard way after all."

Vast bouts of drinking, dancing and singing have been organized in the no man's land along the border, with the newly liberated Onegan militias joining in to celebrate the rebirth of Russia with their brothers to the east. Finnish forward units on the border have mostly retained their positions, but a few have been lured over to the celebrations. Their presence has not been accepted everywhere, but the majority of our soldiers have welcomed their Finnish counterparts. In an era of war and strife unending, peace and friendship deserve celebrations by soldiers weary of fighting."

 russiadiplo.45.t:0 "The Back-Up Demand"
 russiadiplo.45.desc:0 "The Finnish negotiators have pushed back on our demands for eastern Karelia. They claim that they cannot let vast amount of territories be transferred, lest they betray thousands of Finnish citizens. The fact that this land was ours before 1936 has not gotten our negotiators anywhere. Helsinki's diplomats have wryly commented that the 1936 borders must not have been satisfactory to the Soviet Union, as it attempted to invade Finland to correct them. Despite several attempts to reassure the Finns that we are not the successors of the Soviet Union, their negotiators have stayed on their position.\n\nIt might still be possible to scale back our demands to the return of Onega, sweetened by offers of a demilitarized zone and a non-aggression treaty. On the other hand, our generals have remained on standby for a different type of negotiations. Perhaps it is time to make a more convincing argument for eastern Karelia by force of arms?"

Finnish forward units on the border have mostly retained their positions, but a few have been lured over to the celebrations. Likewise, our soldiers have finally peacefully crossed the border into the newly established Karelian Autonomy, joining their Finnish counterparts in celebration.

Viipuri, as they say, as well as Karelia, is rightfully Finnish, and shall not be controlled by our government, which they claim has proven to be overly revanchist and a threat to peace.\n\nWith this, all hope for a settlement has ended. There is not to be a peaceful solution to the Karelian question - rather, the matter must be settled by force of arms. Let our tanks take the field, and the spoils go to the victor!"

Today, the men representing this new government of Western Russia have simply not turned up to the peace talks. As these diplomats have been observed leaving Vipurii, our scouts in Onega have reported vast mobilizations beyond the frontier. It looks like the Russians have only left us one final option: defend our territorial claims through force of arms. Already our generals are sending out the mobilization order while our Onegan conscripts dig in new lines of fortifications. The long dormant Winter War has begun anew."

Ever since we've left the peace talks, the Onegans have followed their masters' bidding and begun preparing for all out war. It is regrettable that we must fight our Russian brothers, but the Finn's arrogance has brought this upon us.\n\nOur General staff's analysis predicts a rapid collapse of the Onegan militia. Beyond them, the lakes Onega and Ladoga create choke points that the Finns intend to defend bitterly. A rapid breakthrough followed by a push into eastern Karelia will bring the Finns to their knees before they fully mobilize!"

To prove our intentions, only limited military police have moved into the new Onega district, while our diplomats in Vyborg have remained in Finland to hash out the terms of this new treaty.\n\nOur soldiers in the field drink and celebrate. They are joined by many Onegans, and quite a few Finns. There will be peace between our nations, no matter what else the future bring our people."

Eastern Karelia will be demilitarized, and freedom of movement will let the Finnish citizens of the region visit their relatives and business partners in Finland proper.\n\nFinnish soldiers evacuating the region have done so with a heavy heart, according to our scouts. But this is for the best. As our diplomats in Vyborg have convinced the Finns, resistance to this demand would have only resulted in a costly, futile war of resistance. Our army is not the disorganized mess it was during the first winter war, and the Finnish observers are well aware of this. Far better for a non-aggression and friendship treaty to be signed than for blood to be spilled on the frozen northern soil."

Our land is to be peacefully turned over to the new western Russian state.\n\nOf course; this is not all totally bad. The fact that the Finns are capable of having negotiations with this new regional unifier is a proof that this new government isn't made of crazies. Compared to the damned communists, or to the accursed traitors of the ROA, or the rumor of crazy German and religious fanatics, this new government of west Russia is run by sensible men and women.\n\nNow the men await our instructions. Used to their independence, and having prepared themselves for a decade for just such a war, the men might follow us in a bid for nationhood. But such a bid will have to be done without Finnish help. The resulting war would be ugly, and most likely futile. Perhaps it is just better to take part in this new project of the Russian people?"

Having spent the better part of a decade preparing for an apocalyptic showdown with the WRRF, the men of Onega now believe they can take on us without any Finnish support and win. They claim to be attached to their independence, their former prison in Onega apparently having become their home.\n\nThe soldiers in the field are disheartened when told of this new senseless enemy. Having to retake Onega through pointless bloodshed is a grim new for our men, from general down to the lowest grunt. But we have to get this done.

 #RUS.1049.desc:0 "Following a recent string of victories in his Russian campaigns, General Secretary Momyshuly, the military leader of Kazakhstan, has laid claim to all of Russia. Declaring that the Kazakh Red Army will assume 'provisional leadership' of a 'new Soviet Union' before eager crowds in Kyzylorda, Momyshuly made it clear that military force would be used against any who denied the legitimacy of the new government.\n\nMost of the other Russian states were quick to reject the Kazakh's claim, but none can deny that the Kazakh Red Army has risen to become one of the most powerful forces in Russia. The international community's reaction has thus far been muted - this is not the first time a post-soviet warlord has made grandiose claims toward reunifcation, and the upstart General still has a long way to go if he intends to make this claim a reality."
