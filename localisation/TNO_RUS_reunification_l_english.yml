We could take advantage of this fact by covertly sending funds to groups that are sympathetic to our cause - and there are two ways about this. First, we can do this discreetly, only sending a minor amount of funds that would provide a mild boost in popularity. This has a very low chance of backfiring on us, and isn't going to be a major step forward, but something is better than nothing.\n\nAlternatively, we could begin publicly endorsing pro-unification groups within [From.GetNameDef]. If this is successful, we could get a large boost of support. If not, this may work against us and cause relations to sour between our government and theirs. What decision shall we make?"

 russia_unification.35.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has rejected our funding!
