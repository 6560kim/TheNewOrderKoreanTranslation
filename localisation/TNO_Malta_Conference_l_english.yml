maltaconference.1.t:0 "몰타 회담"
maltaconference.1.d:0 "트리움비라투스는 붕괴 직전에 놓여있다. 모든 열강이 그 사실을 안다. 아틀란트로파가 등장하며 새로운 육상 국경이 생겨난 결과 수십 년을 존재했던 국경 분쟁은 교전으로 격화되었다. 무역은 엉망이며 경제는 붕괴하고 있다. 아무도 다른 이와 함께 가기를 원치 않는다. 치아노는 트라움비라투스를 지키기 위한 마지막 시도로 회담을 요청했다. 만약 불가능한 일을 하지 않고 잿더미에서 동맹을 끄집어낸다면 최소한 평화롭게 끝낼 수는 있을 것이다.\n\n물론 제일 중요한 문제는 그 정도의 회담이 어디서 개최되냐는 것이다. 치아노 두체는 정적들과 스코르차 당서기를 데리고 비공개회의를 벌었다. 상호 합의가 이루어져야 한다. 구린내 나는 집 같은 이상한 곳을 회담 장소로 정해 당의 축제 분위기를 망쳐서는 안되니 말이다. 하지만 문제는 아직 남아있다. 어디서 회담을 열까? 로마는 안된다. 두 열강은 이탈리아를 동맹의 중심지로 보고 공격해왔다. 마드리드나 앙카라도 안된다. 치아노는 프랑코, 살라자르, 튀르케스에게 본거지에서 회담을 벌이는 자유를 줄 수 없다. 놈들이 트리움비라투스의 중심지처럼 보이는 것도 허락할 수 없다. 치아노는 소파에 앉아 와인을 한 잔 마시며 별생각 없이 상표를 봤다. 몰타산 와인. 그가 제일 좋아하는 것. 잠깐, 몰타라고!\n\n완벽한 곳이었다. 이탈리아의 본거지지만 그렇게 재수없어 보이지는 않았다. 부유하고, 안정되고, 무엇보다 제일 중요한 것은 국경 분쟁이 없다는 것이었다. 모든 창문 너머에는 지중해가 보인다. 살아남은 모든 것들이 반짝인다. 맛있는 음식이 있다. 인종적으로 다양한 사람들이 공존한다. 이건 모범 답안이다. 물론 스코르차는 좋아하지 않을 것이다. 하지만 그런걸 신경 쓸 필요는 없다. 스코르차는 파시즘의 자존심인 로마에서 회담을 열기를 바랬다.\n\n"난 실용주의자야." 치아노는 의기양양하게 생각했다.\n\n회담이 벌어질 곳은 그 유명한 오베르주 드 캐스틸레로 지명되었다. 그곳은 치아노가 몰타에 파견되었을 때 제일 선호하던 숙소였다. 이베리아와 터키에서 온 이들도 호텔의 사치스러움에 쓸려나갈 게 뻔하지 않을까?"
maltaconference.1.a:0 "초대장을 보내라!"

maltaconference.2.t:0 "이베리아 초대"
maltaconference.2.d:0 ""...트라움비라투스의 공식 회원인 이베리아 연방의 카우디요, 프란시스코 프랑코 바아몬데 귀하와 안토니우 드 올리베이라 살라자르 귀하를 몰타의 오베르주 드 캐스틸레에서 열리는 회담에 초대합니다."\n\n프랑코의 이름이 살라자르의 이름 앞에 있는 것은 포르투갈 정부 내에서 의전에 대한 문제를 유발했다. 살라자르 카우디요가 이 사소한 규정 위반에 개인적으로 관련되지는 않았지만 말이다. 이베리아는 회담에 참석할 것이다."
maltaconference.2.a:0 "맞설 시간이다!"

maltaconference.3.t:0 "터키 초대"
maltaconference.3.d:0 ""...트라움비라투스의 공식 회원인 터키의 바슈부, 알프아르슬란 튀르케시 귀하를 몰타의 오베르주 드 캐스틸레에서 열리는 회담에 초대합니다."\n\n"올것이 왔군!" 바슈부는 혼잣말을 했다.\n\n"마침내 멍청한 이탈리아놈이 우리 요구를 영원히 무시할 수 없다는 것을 깨달은 거야."\n\n터키는 회담에 참석할 것이다."
maltaconference.3.a:0 "드디어 우리 요구를 밀어붙일 기회가 왔다!"

maltaconference.4.a:0 "최선의 결과를 바라자..."

maltaconference.5.t:0 "Ciano Gives the Opening Speech"
maltaconference.5.d:0 "Over the past few days, the delegates from around the Triumvirate have arrived. Tensions are high, and many attendees aren"t exactly sure what the purpose of the conference is. Those questions, however, are set to be answered, as Duce Galeazzo Ciano takes the stage.\n\n "Honored delegates," he begins. "We have gathered here today to put aside our differences and reaffirm the greatness of our alliance - I know many of you have disputes and issues to raise, and this is the place to do it."\n\nMany in the audience are shocked by the bluntness of his words, but there are a few smiles.\n\n"At least he recognizes this is going to be a complete shitshow," murmurs one Turkish diplomat to another.\n\n"The Triumvirate was forged in fire," Ciano continues. "And as the world falls back into chaos we must be open and frank with one another if our alliance is to surivive. We are like brothers - squabbling sometimes, but always united in purpose and bound by familial love and common history." Ciano finished.\n\n"I now invite my brother from Turkey to take the stage.""
maltaconference.5.a:0 "Welcome all!"
maltaconference.5.b:0 "Lets get this over with..."

maltaconference.6.t:0 "Türkeş' Speech"
maltaconference.6.d:0 "As Ciano steps down from the stage, the Turkish Başbuğ, Alparslan Türkeş, walks forward, and while the Turkish delegation responds with raucous applause, the rest of the delegation is rather muted. \n\n"I will not bore you with bland pleasantries like the Duce."\n\nTürkeş' halting Italian is overcome by the directness of his words.\n\n"Ciano is right in one regard when he brings up our shared history - we have a history of disputed borders!" he roars.\n\nThe Turkish delegation responds with shouts and cheers, while the rest of the conference looks on sullenly. Many had expected such a response, but few were prepared for the directness of the Başbuğ"s words.\n\n"I am not opposed to the Triumvirate in and of itself," Türkeş continues. "The collective security it offers is a blessing in this tumultuous world. But if Turkey is to continue to remain a member, we must have our ancestral lands back! We are fed up with European domination of our sphere of influence! I look forward to meeting with the leaders of our alliance to discuss our disputed claims, and their return to their rightful motherland, Türkiye!"\n\nThe Turkish delegation practically leap from their seats, slamming their feet on the ground and cheering."
maltaconference.6.a:0 "A great speech by our glorious leader!"
maltaconference.6.b:0 "Worrisome..."

maltaconference.7.t:0 "Franco and Salazar's Speech"
maltaconference.7.d:0 "After that dangerously inflammatory speech, it was time for the two Caudillos of Iberia to take the stage. The two walked together, rubbing shoulders in their attempts to follow formal protocol. Salazar spoke first.\n\n"Honored leaders," he began. "We wish to see the Triumvirate remain united just like our friend and ally Başbuğ Türkeş. And just like him we have disputes of our own to solve to solve."\n\nFranco picked up here. "However, unlike him we will not resort to threats and nationalist agitation. We seek a truly equal agreement for all parties of the Triumvirate!"\n\nThis was met by jeers and heckling from some in the audience.\n\n"We are all equal partners in this great alliance! Remember, for whatever reason you are here, there is one issue more important than all the rest; the preservation of our Mediterranean brotherhood, one and united." \n\nThe two awkwardly took turns speaking for around half an hour, and while they were met with polite applause from the audience, a fair few had dozed off by the time they had finished."
maltaconference.7.a:0 "For the Mediterranean brotherhood!"
maltaconference.7.b:0 "When is this going to end?"

maltaconference.8.t:0 "The Opening of the Canal Conference"
maltaconference.8.d:0 "A major point of contention among the delegates is the Suez Canal.\n\nTransferred to Italian control following their victory in Egypt, they have held sole authority over transit over the canal since then, forcing other Triumvirate members to pay dues just like any other country outside the alliance. Iberia especially has long wanted access to the Canal, as they lack the ground presence of Turkey in the region.\n\nItalian and Iberian delegates, with observers from the other Triumvirate member nations, have gathered in an opulent ballroom to discuss access to the Canal."
maltaconference.8.a:0 "Let us begin!"

maltaconference.9.t:0 "Iberian Demands"
maltaconference.9.d:0 "In the first negotiating session, Iberian diplomat Fernando María Castiella y Maíz demanded Iberia have equal access to the canal. Deliberations continued for hours, until finally the Spaniard slammed his hand on the table.\n\n"You've held the canal for too damn long!" He yelled. "Why the hell should we, your ally, be forced to pay to use it?! We"ll even give you a one-time lump sum of aid money, if you give us unlimited access. That"s my final offer: you can take it or leave it!""
maltaconference.9.a:0 "Ridiculous, refuse outright!"
maltaconference.9.b:0 "Maybe we can come to an agreement..."
maltaconference.9.c:0 "Things are heating up..."

maltaconference.10.t:0 "Ciano Refuses"
maltaconference.10.d:0 "Ciano fires back: "Ridiculous! We"ve trusted you for twenty years and this is how you repay us? Offering a paltry sum for something we fought and bled for? Of course not. These negotiations are over!"\n\nThe Iberian delegates, shocked, reply.\n\n"This is outrageous! We expected to be treated as equals, not children!"\n\nThey continued by claiming they would not participate on later discussions over territorial disputes, and concluded with a scathing attack on Ciano.\n\n"We joined you decades ago because you promised equality and freedom from tyranny. But now? You"re no better than the Germans! Lording over us like some petty Reichskommissariat! We"re done with this conference!""
maltaconference.10.a:0 "Expected."

maltaconference.11.t:0 "Ciano Attempts to Negotiate"
maltaconference.11.d:0 "Ciano replies: "Gentlemen! Let"s be civil here! I'm not sure if I'm willing to take that trade, but perhaps we can come to another agreement."\n\nThe Iberian delegation nods warily. Ciano and other Italian delegates quickly leave the room, quietly whispering, while the Iberians deliberate among themselves."
maltaconference.11.a:0 "Lets see how this goes..."

maltaconference.12.t:0 "Iberian Counteroffer"
maltaconference.12.d:0 "They rejoin a few hours later.\n\n"What about Algeria?" Castiella y Maiz broaches. "We"ll take it - and that little insurrection - off your hands if we just forget this whole dispute. Your colonial forces are overextended and you know it.""
maltaconference.12.a:0 "That may be a bit too much..."

maltaconference.13.t:0 "Ciano Refuses Again"
maltaconference.13.d:0 "Ciano fires back: "Ridiculous! We"ve trusted you for twenty years and this is how you repay us? Trying to steal our territory that we fought and bled for? Of course not. These negotiations are over!"\n\nThe Iberian delegates, shocked, reply.\n\n"This is outrageous! We expected to be treated as equals, not children!"\n\nThey continued by claiming they would not participate on later discussions over territorial disputes, and concluded with a scathing attack on Ciano.\n\n"We joined you decades ago because you promised equality and freedom from tyranny. But now? You"re no better than the Germans! Lording over us like some petty Reichskommissariat! We"re done with this conference!""
maltaconference.13.a:0 "Not suprising."

maltaconference.14.t:0 "Iberia Won"t Attend Border Conference"
maltaconference.14.d:0 "True to their word, the Iberian delegates were nowhere to be seen this morning as the various dignitaries took their seats for the border conference.\n\nTurkish diplomats looked relieved, while Italian delegates shared worried glances. Ciano feared the conference was collapsing around him."
maltaconference.14.a:0 "More for us!"
maltaconference.14.b:0 "Let them have their charade."

maltaconference.15.t:0 "The Start of the Border Conference"
maltaconference.15.d:0 "By and far the largest conflict present in the Triumvirate are the many border disputes that have sparked up in the Triumvirate, between all three members. For this problem to be resolved, there will be two full days dedicated to negotiating over the nature of these disputed territories. The event started with the noticeable lack of Iberian diplomats, as they informed their hosts that they refused to attend it beforehand, as if they're holier than us all. The Başbuğ, Alparslan Türkeş, took the podium, with an oversized chart of the Eastern Mediterranean following behind him, among the rest of the entourage. He began to explain the convoluted ancient importance of Cyprus and Rhodes to Turkey and the demographics of the islands, particularly what Türkeş described as "the overwhelming majority of ethnic, pure Turks." \n\nThe Italian controlled islands of Rhodes and Cyprus have long been a thorn in Turkey's side, due in part to the large minority of Turks, but also more importantly because of their vital strategic importance, serving as inlets into the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean. Furthermore, since the completion of Atlantropa, several of these Italian islands have gained prominent land borders with the Turkish mainland. As the Triumvirate deteriorates, and with the Italo-Turkish relationship becoming one of thinly veiled threats and backhand slaps instead of friends and allies, Türkeş has become much more vocal regarding the issue of these "Rightfully Turkish" lands being denied union with the Turkish state.\n\n"Our demands are clear. We only ask for what has been ours for a millenia." were the words of Türkeş on the proposed concessions. "We will not back down, we will not fold, we will not stop, until we have it." - a reminder on what action Turkey will surely take should their demands be refused."
maltaconference.15.a:0 "You too? Our answer is no."
maltaconference.15.b:0 "Maybe we can come to an agreement?"
maltaconference.15.c:0 "Looks like the Iberians aren"t the only ones..."
maltaconference.15.e:0 "Cyprus and Rhodes are rightfully ours!"

maltaconference.16.t:0 "Ciano Negotiates"
maltaconference.16.d:0 "Ciano pauses.\n\n"I think we can make a deal here. Those islands were originally naval bases. They aren"t terribly useful as parts of the mainland, so I think we can come to some sort of agreement."\n\nTürkeş nods as well. "Excellent. Let's meet and discuss this." "
maltaconference.16.a:0 "Worth a shot."

maltaconference.17.t:0 "Negotations Break Down"
maltaconference.17.d:0 "Negotiations had been going well, with the status of some of the islands decided.\n\nAt least, until Türkeş snapped.\n\n"Why do you insist on treating us as inferiors?" He yelled at Ciano. "Why are you acting like some benevolent god restoring these islands to us?! You should be apologizing and paying reparations for your illegal colonial occupation! These islands aren"t yours to give away! They are Turkish by blood!""
maltaconference.17.a:0 "It had to end like that."

maltaconference.18.t:0 "Ciano Refuses to Negotiate"
maltaconference.18.d:0 "Ciano shakes his head.\n\n"We will not be bullied into giving up land." He says solemnly. "We need those islands as bases. We're more than willing to give joint control over the bas-"\n\nTürkeş cuts him off. "Bastard! I knew it was a mistake coming here! You just want to continue your domination of the Mediterranean, using us as pawns! I'm through with your empty promises!""
maltaconference.18.a:0 "Predictable."

maltaconference.19.t:0 "A Meeting in Saint Julian's"
maltaconference.19.d:0 "The Başbuğ sat in his chair and leaned back, taking a heavy sip of his wine.\n\n"You know it as well as me, Franco. Ciano's not folding to either of our terms. Nothing penetrating that thick skull of his. All we have to do is show him we can cooperate. I"m telling you, this is how we can get to him!"\n\n Franco looked disinterested, and turned his gaze to the Mediterranean. "Really? And what do you suggest we cooperate on? We aren't prone to working together, if you haven't noticed."\n\nSalazar attempted to butt in, but Türkeş spoke before he could. "Just open up a border conflict. You don't have to commit much. It won't be large, I assure you. Help me out on this one, or I guarantee I will not have your back when your regime collapses."\n\nThat had gained Franco's attention. "Alright. I"ll talk to some of my generals on it. I can't guarantee any-"\n\n"No, you can't guarantee anything. Not without my permission."\n\nFranco was beginning to get frustrated with his Portuguese friend, but he would not crack under pressure.\n\n"You're right. Do you agree to this proposal, Salazar?" \n\n"Yes. Let"s call the generals."\n\nThe 'secret' meeting became public knowledge, though each leader refused to comment on the specifics. If there was one thing that the Triumvirate could cooperate on, it was killing each other." 
maltaconference.19.a:0 "Backstabbing traitors!"
maltaconference.19.b:0 "Maybe we can find common ground..."

maltaconference.20.t:0 "The Malta Conference Has Been Bombed!"
maltaconference.20.d:0 "The first reports that reached Rome were sporadic and disjointed. A fire had broken out in the city of Birgu. The Turks had prepared a trap and invaded Malta. The Kriegsmarine were shelling the Fort St. Angelo. Someone tried to shoot Il Duce.\n\n Attempts to verify anything were unsuccessful, as the phone lines to the conference site were all down. Some tried to formulate all this into a single narrative, but it was so self-contradictory that it was fruitless. All anyone could do was wait and pray for good news.\n\nThankfully, it was a wait of only several minutes until it was confirmed that the Duce was alive and would be returning to Rome posthaste. The clearer details also began to trickle in: a bomb went off in the Fort St. Angelo, obliterating the conference room, and both the Başbuğ and the Caudillos survived unscathed due to good timing. The identity of the bomber is unknown, and if it was done by any of the Triumvirate's other member states, it is unlikely they will take responsibility. Some in Rome have already begun pointing fingers at Iberia and Turkey, and there are undoubtedly those who will accuse us.\n\nWhile tensions were high going into the meeting, now they are absolutely astronomical. If the bomber"s goal was to sow chaos in the Mediterranean, then he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams."
maltaconference.20.a:0 "Just when it couldn"t get any worse..."

maltaconference.21.t:0 "이베리타와 터키가 이탈리아를 비난하며 대표단을 철수시키다"
maltaconference.21.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, out of all the members of The Triumvirate, nobody is willing to take responsibility of the bombings. Though Italy claims they had nothing to do with the bombing as they had zero incentive to do so, this has not stopped Iberia and Turkey blaming the italians for the whole fiasco. Both Iberia and Turkey have withdrawn their delegates from the conference stating that it is clear they are not safe for them to be there."
maltaconference.21.a:0 "안돼, 잠깐...!"
maltaconference.21.b:0 "가식은 이제 끝이다!"

maltaconference.22.t:0 "트리움비라투스의 죽음"
maltaconference.22.d:0 "From a very secure undisclosed location in Rome, Duce Ciano has announced with a heavy heart on national television that the mutual bonds of the Triumvirate"s member states are to be dissolved, effective immediately. While he emphasized how much it was his idea, and its success at deterring German warmongering, it is painfully clear that the alliance would not have been long for this world, even without the bombing. It was the inevitable outcome for a union of nations with proud leaders, opposing goals, and competing spheres of influence.\n\nNo doubt that the news is being met with acrimonious agreement in Madrid and Ankara, a mix of happiness that they are finally free and annoyance that they were denied the opportunity to dramatically quit first. But the threat of Germany still looms large in the minds of many, and there may be an hour of need where the Triumvirate will be sorely missed. But that hour is still far away, and few will mourn the Triumvirate's passing tonight."
maltaconference.22.a:0 "뭐 그런거지."
