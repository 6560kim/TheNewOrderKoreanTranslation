 POLITICS_IRAJ_ESKANDARI_DESC:0 "History has been cruel indeed to the worker's revolution. Iraj Eskandari, founder of the Tudeh communist movement, knows this as well as any Iranian can. For decades the Iranian people have languished under a reactionary autocracy, one which put Eskandari himself in prison in a show trial staged by Reza Shah. His successor was no better. Under Mohammed Pahlavi the workers of Persia suffered humiliation upon humiliation. Now the people have risen against their oppressors, armed and funded by Nazis. From his vantage point in the hills and mountains of Tabriz, one man is fated to lead the workers to freedom or oblivion.\n\nThis will be the greatest battle of their lives, waged against unspeakable odds. Other factions in the struggle, aligned with the military establishment, with reactionary clerics or with foreign powers, are determined to bury the socialist dream in the dirt. But Iraj Eskandari has waited for this moment for thirty years. He will die for it if necessary.\n\nAnd should he succeed, then the proletariat will reshape this country and destroy its enemies. Whatever it takes."
