 POLITICS_WERNER_BEST_DESC:0 "베르너 베스트는 몇몇 극우 정당들 사이에서 튀어 나온 확고한 독일 민족주의자였기 때문에 그가 1930년에 나치당에 입당한 것은 별로 놀랄 일이 아니었습니다. 그는 법률과 행정 기술을 사용하여 초기 게슈타포를 조직하고 뮌헨에서 장검의 밤을 조정하는 데 도움을 주면서 SS의 일원이 되었습니다. 1940년 경쟁자들이 그를 게슈타포에서 물러나게 한 후, 그는 프랑스의 군사 점령지에서 복무했고, 1942년 덴마크에 대한 제국의 전권대표로 임명되었습니다. 베스트는 덴마크가 여전히 군주제와 내각 그리고 반민주적인 의회를 유지하는 것이 허용되었기 때문에 자신이 이상한 위치에 있다는 것을 알게 되었습니다. 많은 타협이 이루어졌고, 베스트는 덴마크 정부와 안정적인 관계를 유지하기 위해 덴마크의 유대인 인구를 강제 수용소로 추방하는 것에 대해 충고하기도 했습니다. 1943년 자유선거를 조직하려는 시도와 일련의 노동파업으로 인해 베스트는 이 나라를 독일의 군사 점령하에 두고 의회를 해산시켰지만, 덴마크의 군주제와 내각, 그리고 많은 관료체제는 그대로 남아 있었습니다. 베스트는 또 이상하게도 덴마크 대다수의 유대인들이 스웨덴으로 탈출하는 것을 막을 수 없었고, 유대인 동조자라는 소문이 수십 년 동안 그에게 달라붙어 있었습니다.\n\n전쟁이 끝난 후에도 덴마크는 이상한 상황에 빠져 있었습니다. 명목상으로는 독립했지만 여전히 철저한 감독 아래 있으며, 독일 계엄령으로의 복귀 위협이 끊임없이 대두되고 있습니다. 베스트는 여전히 그의 직책을 유지했고, 그는  광범위한 독일화 프로그램을 실행하려고 시도했습니다. 1950년대의 경제적 붕괴는 자금난을 야기했고 프로그램들은 중단되었지만, 베스트는 여전히 언젠가 덴마크를 대 게르만 제국의 일부로 만들려는 그의 꿈이 현실이 되기를 바라고 있습니다."
 POLITICS_NILS_SVENNINGSEN_DESC:0 "Nils Svenningsen is the personification of the loyal cog in the vast machinery of state, working diligently to keep everything running as smoothly as possible. While some in Germania claim that the former Foreign Minister's loyalties lie more with Denmark than the Reich, his diplomatic record is not to be scoffed at. With a streak of liberal pragmatism matched only by his strict diligence, many are hoping that Svenningsen's ascension to ruler of Denmark following the failed coup by Martinsen's National Socialists may finally herald a period of relative stability in the Protektorat."
 POLITICS_HERMANN_HANNEKEN_DESC:0 "As with most militarists, patience is not a virtue respected by Hermann von Hanneken. Since 1942, he has served the Reich as the chief of police and supreme commander of the Wehrmacht garrison in Denmark, cracking down on dissent and treason. While his strict militarism does not reach the fervent frenzy of Schörner, the officer's concern for the security of the Großgermanisches Reich has led him to take swift action in securing the leadership of Denmark.\n\nVon Hanneken and his loyal clique believe that the complex bureaucracy of Werner Best has created a tight knot around Denmark's throat, a fact well known by Germania. This knot has restricted progression of the nation's Germanization and left it hanging limply as a mere Protektorat in the north. Like Alexander the Great, von Hanneken is ready to sever this rope in one swift motion so that Denmark and its Germanic people at last be integrated into the Reich."
 POLITICS_KNUD_MARTINSEN_DESC:0 "Knud Børge Martinsen's loyalty to the Reich is only superseded by the love for his nation. He has long acted as the Fører of the National Socialist Party of Denmark, serving as the face of the Party while his trusted ally Carl Popp-Madsen acts as its brains. A man of infamous cynicism, Martinsen's rise to power in the Party can be traced back to his actions in the West Russian War of the 1950s. He led his military units to important victories in the chaotic struggle against the Russian advance, his temperament as cold as the snow they fought and bled upon.\n\nDespite serving the Reich as a loyal collaborator for the last two decades, Martinsen's desire for an independent Denmark has been no secret to Germania. With a successful coup cementing his Party's rule over the nation, the Fører's demands for an independent but loyal Denmark may yet come to fruition."
 POLITICS_GUSTAV_MEISSNER_DESC:0 "Gustav Meissner's bureaucratic career has seen him rise through the ranks of the Protektorat's government, and his tenacious loyalty has finally paid off. Formerly a functionary under Werner Best, the death of his boss has propelled him to the position of German Plenipotentiary and effective head of state for Denmark. Meissner is a man who knows how to listen and obey, and his government will doubtless dedicate itself to continuing Best's work without question or delay."
 POLITICS_OCCUPATIONAL_AUTHORITIES_DEN_DESC:0 "With Denmark once again under the German boot, a provisional interim government has been established on the orders of Martin Bormann to stabilize the region. Led by the most efficient German bureaucrats, the Occupational Authorities are preparing to seamlessly transfer power to the next government, which will be selected by the Führer when he deems fit."
 
 DEN_permanent_secretaries:0 "The Permanent Secretaries"
 DEN_permanent_secretaries_desc:0 "Denmark's situation is a remnant from the war. In 1943 Prime Minister Scavenius handed in his government's resignation to the King after some outragous demands from General Hanneken. But King Christian X refused to dismiss the government, but it stood down regardless. Something had to replace the government as the executive branch, and nobody wanted German administration. Nils Svenningsen and the rest of the permanent secretaries from the ministries quickly emerged as spiritual successor to the former Government. Many found this awkward, as non elected officials were running a democratic country, with no political mandate nor legal authority, but secretary of the Interior Ministry developed the concept of 'provisional laws', laws that could be passed within a ministry, and be acted upon by bureaucrats until a parliament could ratify it. With no parliament active, and prospects for one are close to zero, Denmark has turnt into a legal jungle, maneuvering around outdated provisional laws from many years ago.\n\nThe situation is more urgent than it might sound like, as Germania pressures German officials in Denmark to enact more effective measures to hasten the integration of Denmark into the Greater Germanic Reich, noone knows how long the structure will hold. May it live long, and keep Denmark away from foreign control."
 DEN_agrarian_economy:0 "Agrarian Economy"
 DEN_agrarian_economy_desc:0 "The war left the Danish economy damaged, whatever momentum it had going into the war was stopped and reverted during it. Conquests and operations all across Europe, Africa and Russia required rations for soliders and food for civilians. Each year tonnes upon tonnes of Danish grain is distributed around Europe, especially England, as the war saw an end to her former grain-supplier.\n\nWhile the Danish economy is relatively stable, it is stagnant and barely keeping up with the Reich's growing demands. Young bright boys and girls are required to stay on their family's farm to keep production up, effectively forced to give up their dreams of university and lives in the cities. Something must be done to effectize the agriculture so the economy can begin growing quicker."
 DEN_threat_from_silkeborg:0 "Threats from Silkeborg"
 DEN_threat_from_silkeborg_desc:0 "The Wehrmacht Garrison in Silkeborg watches closely everything that happens in Werner Best's 'Dagmarhus'. Hermann von Hanneken, is to say the least, not impressed. Best had suggested in clear text that by 1960, Denmark would be a state in the German Reich. Yet, to Hanneken's great annoyance, Best is still in place and running the show along. Every month, Hanneken sends reports, some true; some exaggerated; some fabricated, about how the resistance is still going, and how bad of a job Best is doing to deal with it. Hanneken, naturally, has ambitions for himself, seeing himself as deserving to run Denmark, it is after all, he, that has kept the peace and kept the resistance weak."

 den.4.d:0 "We have managed to thwart the recent attempt at subverting the will of our government, and the will of our people! Foolish and vain, our heroic soldiers patrolling the capital made quick work of the perpetrators, and now they await their trial. However, despite this clear showing of strength and organization, we have a major problem that is now facing us. The Führer of the Reich, Albert Speer, leader of a Germany bound to fall into degeneracy and trappings of "democracy", has demanded that we are to immediately release the treasoners that we have taken to trial, and that we enter into the Einheitspakt. Though we could deny as a showing of ideological purity and continue with the trial, which would conclude with their mass execution, we also have to consider the legitimacy of their threats. We may see the Führer as a spineless betrayer of National Socialism, but with the possibility of the Wehrmacht bearing down on our borders, we may be strong-armed into joining the Reich so that we do not lose our sovereignty.\n\nRegardless of what we may think, we must make a decision with all due haste."
