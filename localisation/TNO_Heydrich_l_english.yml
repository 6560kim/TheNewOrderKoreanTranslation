 POLITICS_REINHARD_HEYDRICH_DESC:0 "Heydrich has many names. The Blond Beast. The Butcher of Prague. The Man with the Iron Heart. After narrowly surviving an assassination attempt during the World War, Heydrich personally assisted his men in hunting down and wiping out thousands of partisans in the former Czechoslovakia. Pictures of him standing triumphantly amidst the ruins of partisan strongholds were used prominently in German propaganda campaigns, and even served as the basis for an extremely popular film jointly produced by Goebbels and Riefenstahl.\n\nIn the years that followed, he continued his advance upwards through the ranks of the SS, eventually attaining the position of Reichsführer (of the German-SS) following Himmler’s failed coup and ‘exile’ to the Ordensstadt. He did not, however, forget where his loyalties lied. A puppet master under a puppet master, he now works both to expand the influence of the German-SS as well as to execute the desires of Reichsführer Himmler within the Reich proper, whatever they may be.\n\nAlthough not privy to all of the secrets and long-term desires of his dark master, he continues to follow directives faithfully, earning him something of a servile reputation. Of course, however, none would ever dare say so to his face."
 POLITICS_HEYDRICH_COLLAPSED_AUTHORITY_DESC:0 "Reinhard Heydrich is dead, struck down by an assassin during the valiant struggle for Germany. With his death, all centralized authority within the German-SS has collapsed, as commanders at varying levels of the disintegrating command structure act unilaterally towards various uncoordinated and selfish ends. Combined with the simultaneous end of Burgundian interest in supporting the German-SS to any further extent, it is safe to say that the attempt by the SS to seize control of Germany has decisively failed."

 ###Modifiers###
 HGR_Burgundian_support:0 "부르군트의 지지"
 HGR_Burgundian_support_desc:0 "The Führer has decided to, as much as possible, rely upon direct support from the Ordensstadt in the struggle for Germany. Permitted to advance National Socialism in their own country without interference from corrupting elements, the Burgundian-SS exemplify the pinnacle of the Aryan ideal, and their assistance will help in securing total victory for the SS over its many enemies."
 HGR_black_sun_rising:0 "Black Sun Rising"
 #HGR_black_sun_rising_desc:0 "The performance of the German-SS has been, to put it mildly, disappointing in the extreme. Despite the gifted leadership of the Burgundian-SS as well as the provision of vast quantities of equipment from the factories of the Ordensstadt,the SS in Germany have not achieved victory. If this is not rectified presently, Reichsführer Himmler may soon consider if his confidence has been misplaced."
 HGR_stormbrigades:0 "Stormbrigades"
 HGR_Waffen_Support:0 "무장친위대 지원"
 HGR_Waffen_Support_desc:0 "The Waffen-SS are not Aryan. They are not even German. But they are numerous, merciless, and obedient, and given the small size of the German-SS in comparison to the armies arrayed against the Reichsführer, they are needed. Their numbers will clear the way for more valuable Aryan formations, and shield them from unnecessary loss. And in the end, when the war is won? Those that are still alive can be easily disposed of."
 HGR_for_heydrich:0 "하이드리히를 위해!"
 HGR_for_heydrich_desc:0 "This war is not a Burgundian war. It is not a war for auxiliaries. It is a German war, fought on German soil and the German-SS must lead the charge. United behind The Führer Heydrich, they will advance across their native land, cleansing it of corruption and securing it both for the future of the Aryan race and for the salvation of National Socialism."

 HGR_burgundian_advisors:0 "부르군트 고문단"
 HGR_burgundian_advisors_desc:0 "Officers from the Burgundian-SS have arrived and been embedded within the military command structure. Freed from base concern over the transitory well being of the German people and instead focused on the long-term salvation of National Socialism, they will act to significantly increase the combat potential of the units they advise."
 HGR_burgundian_commanders:0 "Burgundian Commanders"
 HGR_burgundian_commanders_desc:0 "The corps of advisors from the Ordensstadt have been augmented with additional personnel, allowing them to assume effective command of most of our armed formations. Increases in aggression, determination, and discipline have already been observed, further increasing the combat potential of the units they now command."
 HGR_anti_partisan_brigades:0 "Anti-Partisan Brigades"
 HGR_anti_partisan_brigades_desc:0 "Just like in the last war, as our disciplined legions advance they find partisans in their wake, attacking supply lines, ambushing isolated detachments, and causing trouble. The SS well knows how to deal with partisans, and the fact that in this case they are German makes no difference. To a man, they will be hunted down and eradicated by specialized detachments of the SS, SD, and Einsatzgruppen."
 HGR_your_life_for_heydrich:0 "Your Life for Heydrich"
 HGR_your_life_for_heydrich_desc:0 "It has been claimed by many that it is, in actuality, Reichsführer Himmler who is the true leader of the SS in Germany. Such a lie damages both the motivation of our soldiers and the fidelity of the civilians who occupy our rear areas. To counter this, special care is being taken to ensure that victories both on and off the field of battle are correctly attributed to the one man most responsible for them - The Führer himself."
 HGR_the_final_stand:0 "The Final Stand"
 HGR_the_final_stand_desc:0 "Having determined that the Führer can no longer deliver Germany to the Burgundian-SS, the Ordensstadt’s officers have departed, and their shipments of supplies and equipment have ceased. The state has been abandoned. But it has not yet fallen. Every member of the SS in Germany, true Aryans all, will fight to the last bullet, the last man, and the last breath. Meine Ehre heißt Treue!"
 HGR_SS_blitz:0 "The Black Blitzkrieg"
 HGR_SS_blitz_desc:0 "This war has dragged on too long, and the twin fatal dangers of being overwhelmed by enemies and of losing the confidence of the Ordensstadt are growing by the day. The Führer has demanded action. An audacious offensive, leveraging our reserves of men, materiel, and spirit, will recapture the initiative and lead us towards the final victory! It will succeed. It must."
 HGR_SS_commissariat:0 "SS Commissars"
 HGR_SS_commissariat_desc:0 "To combat the shocking lack of discipline from the many non-Aryan units of the Waffen-SS, the Führer has authorized the establishment of unit-elevated commissars. Given the power of life and death over their soldiers and tasked with enforcing discipline through any methods necessary, their effect has already been felt in the increased performance of the auxiliaries."
 HGR_deutsch_sicherheitsdienst:0 "German Sicherheitsdienst"
 HGR_deutsch_sicherheitsdienst_desc:0 "In an attempt to address recent resorts of ill discipline, insubordination, and recklessness amongst the Waffen-SS auxiliaries, the Führer has assigned additional resources to the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and ordered increased oversight of their formations. A positive side effect of this expansion is a corresponding increase in the SD’s cryptographic capability."
 HGR_heydrichjugend:0 "Die Heydrichjugend"
 HGR_heydrichjugend_desc:0 "With the survival of the race at stake, every German is needed, and this is just as true of the children of Aryans as it is for Aryans themselves. Created in the image of the Hitlerjugend the Heydrichjugend, participation in which is mandatory for all German boys, will act as auxiliaries, messengers, porters, and in many other roles besides. In doing so, they will become rapidly accustomed to the particulars of military life, and can thus be rapidly mobilized once they are, inevitably, required to join their fathers in battle."
 HGR_terror_campaign:0 "Terror Campaigns"
 HGR_terror_campaign_desc:0 "In this war for the very survival of the German soul, dissent behind the lines cannot be permitted. Liberals, communists, clergymen, defeatists, and more infest the land, and policing them is not an efficient use of resources. Using lessons learned long ago, security detachments can ensure compliance through the application of brutal reprisals. Demonstrating the swift response that follows any hint of opposition will ensure that such opposition does not occur."
 HGR_burgundian_einsatzgruppen:0 "Burgundian Einsatzgruppen"
 HGR_burgundian_einsatzgruppen_desc:0 "Specialised Einsatzgruppen detachments have suddenly appeared in the territories administered by SS forces. Sent by the Ordensstadt, and tasked with maintaining control in our rear areas through any means that they deem necessary, they will work to enforce order through the strict application of summary judgement on any perceived offenders."
 HGR_idea_mandatory_spartanism:0 "Mandatory Spartanism"
 HGR_idea_mandatory_spartanism_desc:0 "The Führer has announced a radical and transformative change to German society. From top to bottom, the values of the Ordensstadt - discipline, self-improvement, and absolute obedience to higher authority - will now be applied to German society. While not entirely unexpected given the victory of the SS in the Bürgerkrieg, the speed of implementation is leaving many confused. Is there a reason why the Führer requires such rapid implementation?"
 HGR_loyalty_to_himmler:0 "Loyalty to Himmler"
 HGR_loyalty_to_himmler_desc:0 "Without the support received from the Ordensstadt, the many enemies of the SS would likely have already triumphed, and corrupted National Socialism almost beyond repair. As such it has been made clear that the Führer sees Reichsführer Himmler and the Burgundian-SS as the last, best hope for the triumph of the Aryan race, and that any and all demands or impositions from Burgundy should be immediately fulfilled."
 
 ### Focus Tree ### 
 HGR_burgerkreig:0 "Der Bürgerkrieg"
 HGR_burgerkreig_desc:0 "We saw this, the end of the Reich, in our dreams long ago. An apocalyptic storm of fire and blood, of corruption, Bolshevism, and vanity, scourging the forests and mountains of our home and leaving nothing behind in its wake.\n\nBut it does not have to end this way. Reinhard Heydrich, true heir of Hitler and Reichsführer of the German-SS, stands tall and true to resist it, and behind him stand the loyal legions who will give their lives for Germany. For the sake of the Aryan race, for the future of the Reich, for our glorious salvation - he must, and will, win.\n\nHeil Heydrich!"
 HGR_burgundische_SS:0 "Burgundian-SS"
 HGR_burgundische_SS_desc:0 "The Burgundian-SS are the most loyal and true servants of both National Socialism and of the Aryan race. Having spent years removed from the corruption of the Reich and of feeble Hitlerism, they alone are capable of securing victory.\n\nBeing free of temptation and pure of blood, the Ordensstadt already offers their aid in the titanic struggle for the future of Germany. Surely we cannot but accept."
 HGR_a_helping_hand:0 "A Helping Hand"
 HGR_a_helping_hand_desc:0 "Having accepted the offer of increased assistance from the Ordensstadt, Reichsführer Himmler has agreed to immediately provide more equipment, more soldiers, and more political support.\n\nAlready the Burgundian convoys approaching our borders are larger, the trucks more tightly packed, and the men who accompany them are no longer returning once their cargoes are delivered. With this support, we cannot but be victorious."
 HGR_advisor_staff:0 "고문단"
 HGR_advisor_staff_desc:0 "On the advice of those he has already dispatched, Reichsführer Himmler has informed us that many of the officers at our disposal cannot be considered wholly dependable. Familial ties, material possessions, blind ambition, and misguided concern for fellow Germans threaten to negatively influence their decisions and allow opportunities to advance our position to go to waste.\n\nSenior officers sourced directly from Ost-Paris share none of these weaknesses, and the Ordensstadt will send them to assist us. Serving in embedded advisory roles, they will provide their expertise - and their supervision - to the lesser men of the German-SS."
 HGR_combined_formations:0 "Combined Formations"
 HGR_combined_formations_desc:0 "The SS has dominated every battlefield it has ever encountered. This is of course the result of their oaths of loyalty, which override the obstacles, such as fear, doubt, and mercy, that give lesser men pause.\n\nThe unifying force of these oaths create an unshakeable bond between Aryan soldiers, and as the integration of German and Burgundian combat units progress, so too will the synthesis of German fighting spirit and Burgundian dedication. The result shall be the most ferocious fighters ever seen in war."
 HGR_burgundian_leaders:0 "Burgundian Leaders"
 HGR_burgundian_leaders_desc:0 "The Burgundian advisors embedded in our combat formations have reported an increase in the expression of ‘correct’ Aryan ideals, such as obedience and stringent discipline, amongst the soldiers they oversee. And so the time has come to take the integration of our organizations to the next level.\n\nUntil now, the commanders of these formations have primarily originated from the German-SS, but these men do not understand the modern Aryan method of war as those from the Ordensstadt do. Reichsführer Himmler has informed us that his hand-picked officers are already en route - they will be most welcome within our chain of command."
 HGR_burgundian_knowledge:0 "Burgundian Knowledge"
 HGR_burgundian_knowledge_desc:0 "In warfare, accurate and timely intelligence is critical, and Reichsführer Himmler possesses this in enormous quantities. Furthering his, and by extension the Ordensstadt’s, support of our faction, it has been agreed that any intelligence that furthers the cause of National Socialism will be immediately forwarded to us.\n\nWith the military dispositions and political secrets of our enemies at our fingertips, we will hold considerable advantage, the leverage of which will be exploited to maximum effect."
 HGR_arms_drives:0 "Arms Drives"
 HGR_arms_drives_desc:0 "A war cannot be won without purity of spirit. But it also cannot be won without vast quantities of materiel. We have much of the former, and little of the latter.\n\nReichsführer Himmler understands this, and has pledged to prioritize the delivery of arms and ammunition from the Ordensstadt’s factories in order to equip our soldiers to a level that matches their laudable zeal. With spirit in body and rifle in hand, we will march to victory."
 HGR_arms_pipeline:0 "Arms Pipeline"
 HGR_arms_pipeline_desc:0 "We have received excellent news. Reichsführer Himmler has seen fit to greatly increase both the amount and the frequency of materiel shipments from the Ordensstadt, transforming the previous system of regular deliveries into a regular and reliable flow.\n\nClearly relying on reports from the increasingly integrated Burgundian command cadres within the Reich, the close attention of the Reichsführer to the realities of our military situation is truly humbling. With his increasing dedication of the Ordensstadt’s military production to our cause, we will never want for military equipment."
 HGR_hiyo_brittany:0 "Hiyo Brittany"
 HGR_hiyo_brittany_desc:0 "The Breton ‘state’ is an abomination that blights the map of Europe. All it, and by extension they, care about is wealth, and they openly sell arms and equipment to our enemies.\n\nTheir greed, however, means that they will just as readily sell the same equipment to us. We will use this weakness of character to acquire what we need to achieve victory in the struggle for the Reich.\n\nAnd once the war is won, we will eradicate them and reclaim everything we, and others, have paid."
 HGR_anti_partisanship:0 "Anti-Partisanship"
 HGR_anti_partisanship_desc:0 "Our war might be a civil war, but that does not mean that we will be free of saboteurs, partisans, and unrest behind the lines. Indeed, as any such actions would be perpetrated by our own citizens, they may be even more effective, as soldiers hesitate to shoot their countrymen.\n\nBut we well know how to deal with partisans, regardless of race or citizenship. As we did many years ago, we will rely upon the Einsatzgruppen, augmented with detachments from the SD, to forcibly maintain order behind the lines. Any dissident who thinks to stab us in the back will learn, very quickly, the folly of such action."
 HGR_for_the_true_fuhrer:0 "For The True Führer"
 HGR_for_the_true_fuhrer_desc:0 "Many deride the Führer as little more than a puppet for Reichsführer Himmler. They claim his only goal is to deliver the Reich into the clutches of the Ordensstadt. And their words are, worryingly, increasingly gaining traction amongst the German people.\n\nConsequently, the Führer has ordered that special care be taken to attribute the victories of our soldiers to him and him alone. Himmler may not be entirely pleased, but he will, he must, understand. Once the war is won, what was said during it will not matter, and the Führer has no intention of forgetting where his loyalties lie."
 HGR_rally_on_heydrich:0 "Rally On Heydrich"
 HGR_rally_on_heydrich_desc:0 "The common people of the Reich have disappointed the Führer. They fear our soldiers, resent us for appropriating their ill-gotten wealth, and act whenever possible to sabotage our mission of salvation. This will not do.\n\nTo rectify this, the Führer will remind the people of the true Aryan ideals of obedience and hard work. Anyone unwilling to volunteer will be drafted, either into the military or onto the factory floor. In this way he will save them from themselves, as any true leader would."
 HGR_only_for_germany:0 "Only For Germany"
 HGR_only_for_germany_desc:0 "The propaganda of our enemies, concerning the Führer’s purpose as it relates to the Ordensstadt, is deviously effective, further evidence of the degeneracy and corruption of our enemies. We cannot permit these falsehoods to spread any further.\n\nThe Führer, and by extension the SS - Burgundian or otherwise - is loyal to National Socialism, the Reich, and the Aryan race. To say otherwise is treason, and will be dealt with accordingly."
 HGR_deutsch_SS:0 "German-SS"
 HGR_deutsch_SS_desc:0 "The Burgundians are exemplars of Spartan professionalism, being disciplined, obedient, and merciless. The Waffen-SS are legion, entirely dependent upon us and The Burgundians are noble allies, exemplars of all that is good and true in the Aryan race. The Waffen-SS are legions without number, unshackled by sympathy for those they will fight and wholly disposable.\n\nBut neither can win this war for us. As the Führer has made clear, this is a German war, fought on German soil. And so the vanguard of our victory must be composed of Germans before all else. This will not be an easy path to walk, but walk it we must."
 HGR_lesser_allies:0 "Lesser Allies"
 HGR_lesser_allies_desc:0 "The sinister reputation of the Ordensstadt, while useful in some aspects, is a hindrance in others. For better or for worse, we are linked to that image, and that burden is being felt in the reluctance of ordinary Germans to volunteer for our armies.\n\nBy publicly distancing ourselves, however superficially, from the Ordensstadt, we will make ourselves more appealing to Germans who want to fight for Germany, and not Burgundy. Reichsführer Himmler will not be happy, but he will surely understand. The future of the Reich is at stake, and that is more important than any one man."
 HGR_purity:0 "Purity"
 HGR_purity_desc:0 "Attempts by our enemies to paint the Führer as a traitor to Germany are laughable. Reinhard Heydrich was a dear friend and confidant of the great Adolf Hitler, who was so confident in his ability to lead the Aryan race to its promised destiny that he was nominated the official successor to the Führership.\n\nIf one wants to see traitors, one need only look at those who oppose the rightful Führer - a Bolshevik, a vain puppet, and a corrupt bureaucrat. Can they inspire the Volk to lay their lives down for the Reich? They cannot, and by showing the people the purity of purpose that the Führer embodies, we will secure their support."
 HGR_define_german:0 "Define 'German'"
 HGR_define_german_desc:0 "Science ever marches forward, and racial science is no different. Once only Prussians were considered true Germans. Now, as before, our knowledge has expanded.\n\nThere are more Germans in Europe than we thought, even if they are found in France, Bohemia, or elsewhere. Within our own lands, these people must be elevated, brought into the ranks of the German-SS, and pressed into combat. All Germans in our territory will be found, and all found will fight for their Reich!"
 HGR_volunteer_divisions:0 "Volunteer Divisions"
 HGR_volunteer_divisions_desc:0 "The ‘Germanization’ of the Führer’s image, despite the problems it is causing us with Ordensstadt, has proven a success. More and more people within our territory are volunteering to help us fight for their nation and for the National Socialist ideal.\n\nEnough have volunteered, in fact, that we now have the resources to begin fielding entire divisions’ worth of militia. Although not comparable in quality to our SS formations, or even the few Heer units that have fallen under our command, they are motivated and loyal, and can be relied upon to hold the line while more experienced units spearhead our offensives."
 HGR_fight_for_whats_right:0 "Fight For What's Right"
 HGR_fight_for_whats_right_desc:0 "The increased focus on our war as a German war, fighting for the German people, continues to increase our support amongst the civilian population. We must continue on this path. Showing our fellow Aryans that the SS is not their enemy, that we act only to protect the National Socialist way of life, and that any negative perceptions of us are the result of fabrications, is critical.\n\nBy doing so, and by further redirecting their antipathy to our enemies, we will increase our support even further, with all the benefits of internal stability, political capital, and recruitment capacity that such implies."
 HGR_for_a_stronger_germany:0 "For A Stronger Germany"
 HGR_for_a_stronger_germany_desc:0 "We have, lately, discovered shocking inefficiency in our factories. Workers have been lax, raw materials have been wasted unnecessarily, and quality controls are not being enforced.\n\nThis is unacceptable. We are fighting for the future of the Aryan race, and the output of the factory, and the factory worker, is just as critical to our cause as a soldier's bravery or a pilot's daring. We will establish a board of oversight to keep close watch on our industrial facilities, and so ensure that every man-hour possible is extracted from our workforce. The war effort demands it."
 HGR_for_a_pure_germany:0 "For A Purer Germany"
 HGR_for_a_pure_germany_desc:0 "We are at war, and that war must take precedence over all other considerations. But that does not mean that we neglect our duty to National Socialism. Within both our territory as well as that we occupy during our inexorable advance, undesirables abound.\n\nFifth columnists, clergymen, defeatists, Bolsheviks, and more infest our lands, and we will no longer countenance their existence. Effective immediately, the Führer has declared that they are to be shot whenever and wherever found. With each one so eliminated, Germany is that much closer to salvation."
 HGR_loot_pipeline:0 "Loot Pipeline"
 HGR_loot_pipeline_desc:0 "As our legions advance across the Reich, we find ourselves with control over the material possessions of millions of ordinary Germans. Ordinary Germans who did not move to support us at the beginning of the war. While we do not have the time to deal with them all right now, we can still extract value from them.\n\nWe will appropriate all their currency, property, and other assets in order to support our war effort and pay for the import of arms and other materiel. In this way, even enemies of the Reich can, begrudgingly, serve it."
 HGR_whats_yours_is_ours:0 "What's Yours Is Ours"
 HGR_whats_yours_is_ours_desc:0 "This war is everything. It is the future of the Reich. It is the future of the Volk. It is the future of the Aryan. And, so, every true German must be willing to dedicate everything in its defence. Money, family, friendships, and even their very life.\n\nAnd if they are not willing to do so, the question must be asked - why not? Either they will surrender everything willingly, and lay down their lives with pride, or we will take everything, and send them to the front as a conscript. It is their choice to make."
 HGR_Waffen_SS:0 "Waffen-SS"
 HGR_Waffen_SS_desc:0 "Where the Burgundians are merciless professionals, and the German-SS is a legion fighting for its native land, neither can win this war. We are massively outnumbered by our opponents, both in men and materiel and only the Waffen-SS, auxiliaries from the many territories rendered subservient to the Reich, can be raised in sufficient numbers.\n\nObedient without question and eminently disposable, relying upon them is the best we can hope for given our circumstances. With the vast legions of the Waffen-SS under our command, this war will be put to a quick and decisive end."
 HGR_all_the_sons_of_the_reich:0 "All The Sons Of The Reich"
 HGR_all_the_sons_of_the_reich_desc:0 "Allowing racial corruption in an army is a dangerous thing, but it does allow for that army to be vastly larger, and the impact of that cannot be denied. Being recruited from every corner of the Reich, the lack of racial purity in the Waffen-SS may reduce their overall effectiveness, but a degenerate can still fight and die for his betters.\n\nOpening the ranks further, and allowing anyone who wishes to enlist to do so may dilute that purity even further, but it would improve our image amongst the vassal races, and allow us to expand our military to an even greater degree.\n\nAnd who knows? The fires of battle might inspire the display of Aryan virtues in even the most debased auxiliary."
 HGR_recruitment_overdrive:0 "Recruitment Overdrive"
 HGR_recruitment_overdrive_desc:0 "With their ‘relaxed’ racial requirements, the Waffen-SS has never had difficulties with recruitment. In fact, they already have several new divisions ready to be deployed in the service of our goals.\n\nSome are uneasy at the prospect of mobilizing even more non-Aryans, but we cannot and will not turn away trained, equipped, and willing men.\n\nIf they wish to prove themselves to their betters on the battlefield, so be it."
 HGR_friends_in_bohemia:0 "Friends In Bohemia"
 HGR_friends_in_bohemia_desc:0 "Our comrades in Bohemia have waited a very long time for this moment. Amongst the most experienced of the Waffen-SS divisions, and composed of large numbers of thoroughly Germanized Czechs, they will serve our cause ably.\n\nAlthough not yet ready to join the fight on the front lines, they have pledged to smuggle large quantities of high-quality munitions to us as they make their final preparations. With the demands of war pressing strongly upon us, any and all support can, and will, be welcomed."
 HGR_over_the_mountains_high:0 "Over The Mountains"
 HGR_over_the_mountains_high_desc:0 "True to their word, the Bohemian SS formations that we previously established contact with have managed to escape the Protektorat, pass through the mountains of the Sudetenland, and moved to join us.\n\nTheir progress through the lands of our enemies was slow, and not entirely successful, but they have now arrived, and are ready to fight. Although few in number, the strength of character shown in their long journey cannot but be a portent of great things to come and victories yet to be won."

And they will be rendered the slaves they always should have been.\n\nThe Führer is their only chance at salvation, the only man who can make their worthless mongrel lives have any meaning at all. And so he will give them the simplest choice that a man has ever given another. They can fight until the last bullet, or they cannot. They can live, or they can die.\n\nIt is time for them to choose."

 #### EVENTS ###
 
 heydrich_successor.1.t:0 "Open Fire"
 heydrich_successor.1.desc:0 "The day began quietly, but would not end so. The group outside the SS compound in Bonn, consisting initially of local students and protesting the increasing presence of the SS in the government, began assembling at dawn. As the hours passed, it continued to grow, and rapidly became the largest anti-SS march Germany had yet seen since Reichsführer Heydrich had been named Hitler’s successor.\n\nThe activity of the students was extraordinary, but not surprising, given national tensions. What was surprising was the participation, at first timid but then growing, of ordinary middle-class Germans, those who would have been considered to be content with the state. But they were also those who felt Heydrich, and the Burgundian system in general, fundamentally threatened their futures. And so they marched alongside their younger contemporaries.\n\nAt first the SS guards simply maintained the perimeter, but by late afternoon they had had enough. Shots rang out from sharpshooters positioned high above, striking down identified leaders. More were added from the assembled troopers on the ground, and as the stampede began, so did the massacre. By the time the street was clear, dozens of bodies lay unmoving on the ground.\n\nAcross Germany, millions were in shock. The SS had never opened fire on a German crowd before."
 heydrich_successor.1.a:0 "But times have changed."
 
 heydrich_successor.2.t:0 "Smile Beside Hitler"
 heydrich_successor.2.desc:0 "Hitler stepped up to the podium in front of the adoring crowd, peering at them through unfocused eyes and suppressing a terrible coughing fit before looking down at the speech that had been placed there beforehand.\n\n"I...I reaffirm," he began, "the capability of my appointed successor..." He trailed off, looking dazed and unsure, and turned slightly to the aide standing closely beside him.\n\n"Reichsführer Heydrich, mein Führer," the aide corrected without missing a beat, performing a task he had completed countless times in recent years.\n\n"...the capability of my appointed successor, Reichsführer Heydrich, in all matters concerned with the administration of the German state. He is not only a loyal son of Germany, but a true vanguard of the Aryan race. I..." Hitler suddenly stopped speaking, the world blurring in front of him.\n\nAs he gripped the podium for support the aide, recognizing signs seen many times before, gripped his Führer’s arm tightly. Hitler did not resist as he was shuffled off the stage, to the great confusion of the abandoned crowd."
 heydrich_successor.2.a:0 "Clearly a ringing endorsement."

 heydrich_successor.3.t:0 "Dark Eyes"
 heydrich_successor.3.desc:0 "Fear lives in Germany. No matter the station, no matter the family, it lives in the heart of every person touched by the National Socialist state. And that means everyone.\n\nIt lives in the children, who stop their games to watch columns of soldiers march in lockstep down their street, knowing that they will almost certainly one day be among them.\n\nIt lives in the soldiers, who eye each other warily and guard what they say, lest they be reported for defeatism or sedition.\n\nIt lives in the politician, who knows that one wrong word, one unseen plot, could lead to his downfall.\n\nAnd it lives in Heydrich. Buried deeply within, coloring every action he takes, it is truly all he knows. He fears the children. He fears the soldiers. He fears the politicians.He fears his own fear. But unlike the others, he knows how to use his own fear. It doesn’t paralyze him with inaction.\n\nIt emboldens him with determination."
 heydrich_successor.3.a:0 "The oldest and strongest emotion of man is fear. And it can be harnessed."
 
 heydrich_successor.4.t:0 "Rubicon"
 heydrich_successor.4.desc:0 "The orders given to the members and functionaries of the Reichstag, as delivered by stone-faced SS troopers, were exceedingly simple. They were to leave, and not come back.\n\nLater, numerous and more official communications came from the Chancellery, citing laws and powers formally accorded to Heydrich by Hitler, but they mattered little. He had not bothered to give a speech or issue a formal announcement. He had instead, simply and with the stroke of a pen, permanently dissolved the Reichstag, ending even the farce of German legislative authority.\n\nA new Germany, an Aryan Germany, forged in the image of the SS was in the making, and there was no place in it for such a bygone relic.\n\nIt took longer for this truth to reach the other collective institutions of German civilian government, but it reached them all the same - often and similarly at the barked order of an SS officer."
 heydrich_successor.4.a:0 "By order of the Führer, the Reichstag is dissolved, effective immediately."

 heydrich_successor.5.t:0 "Hear No Evil"
 heydrich_successor.5.desc:0 "With well-designed and well-rehearsed plans, SS detachments all over Germany moved with cold, surgical precision to interrupt the communications of both the military as well as other organs of state. The troopers were men of action and experience, and every step taken was designed to advance their goal in the most efficient manner possible.\n\nFrom the Rhineland to East Prussia, from Schleswig to Austria, they cut wires, destroyed radio towers, burned documents, and dragged messengers away from roads and into shallow graves. Before long, the communications infrastructure of nearly every civilian and military organization - other than Heydrich’s SS, of course - was near-totally destroyed.\n\nThey would rebuild what they could, of course. But to completely do so would take a considerable amount of time.\n\nTime Heydrich knew they would not have."

 heydrich_successor.6.t:0 "Burgundian Reinforcements"
 heydrich_successor.6.desc:0 "Typically, the border between the Reich and the Ordensstadt was a quiet place. There was little that Himmler’s fiefdom wanted to let in from Germany, and even less that they wanted to let out.\n\nBut in recent weeks, this has changed. On a near-nightly basis caravans of sealed trucks, their windows tinted and cargoes concealed, have approached the frontier from the Burgundian side, choosing sectors where Reichsführer Heydrich’s SS holds significant influence.\n\nWaved through without challenge or inspection, they continue in tight formation before invariably ending their journey at an SS installation. Nobody can say for sure what they contain but whatever it may be, it is disappearing into SS stockpiles just as quickly as new SS formations, the origins of which cannot be accounted for, are appearing at the same locations.\n\nLocal officials, border guards, and nearby Wehrmacht detachments have attempted to investigate, but have been stymied by both legal obstructions put in place by the Führer-designate as well as the unexplained disappearance of many of their investigators.\n\nIt seems that Himmler may be not-so-covertly assisting his former confederate."

 HGR.1.t:0 "Heydrich's Germany"
 HGR.1.desc:0 "The sudden outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg left the Wehrmacht in chaos. With orders from each faction commanding them to attack the others, units fractured, were paralyzed with indecision, or, in some cases, fired upon each other. Desertion skyrocketed. As a result, the early military operations of Speer, Göring, and Bormann were crippled until units loyal to each of them in turn were able to consolidate.\n\nThe SS however, united in purpose and leadership, avoided this problem entirely. Having prepared for such an eventuality for some time, they threw themselves into coordinated action, attacking isolated Wehrmacht installations and detachments, and wholly preventing decentralized internal conflict.\n\nThis enabled them to swiftly secure control over their base areas in East Prussia, Alsace-Lorraine, and the Rhineland, and better orient themselves for offensive operations against territory that was, at least nominally, under the control of their opposition.\n\nIn addition, by establishing control over the border areas with the Ordensstadt, the German-SS is well-situated to receive unobstructed aid from their Burgundian counterparts. Although the Ordensstadt has claimed neutrality in the conflict, it is an open secret that the nascent SS ‘state’ has Reichsführer Himmler’s backing."
 HGR.1.a:0 "They knew this was coming."

 HGR.2.t:0 "Burgundian Aid"
 HGR.2.desc:0 "In anticipation of large-scale factional conflict, supplies from the Ordensstadt have been crossing the border for some time, finding themselves, invariably, deposited into SS stockpiles. Given the former, and some say continuing, relationship between the two Reichsführers, this was not a surprise to anyone informed about the situation.\n\nThe level of assistance has increased, however, and now large groups of Burgundian-SS members have crossed the border as well, to augment and even in some areas replace native German-SS formations.\n\nThough the other factions have loudly decried this development, claiming that the Ordensstadt is now, in essence, invading the Reich, they can do little to stop it."
 HGR.2.a:0 "The strongest shall survive!"

 HGR.3.t:0 "Heydrich Victorious!"
 HGR.3.desc:0 "Both domestic and international media today captured the triumphant entry of Reinhard Heydrich into Germania following his victory in the German Civil War. Surrounded by legions of SS soldiers, the now-undisputed Führer paraded past vast crowds with arm outstretched in salute, emulating his predecessor Adolf Hitler.\n\nIn front of the Volkshalle, a grand monument to German strength, Heydrich vowed in a speech to the nation that he would ‘act to restore the previously corrupted ideals of true National Socialism to both the people and the state.’\n\nIn surprise attendance was Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, on one of his only journeys outside the Ordensstadt in recent memory. Taking the podium after Heydrich, he announced a complete reversal of previously cold relations between the nations as well as the establishment of an alliance to ‘ensure the true legacy of the Aryan people.’\n\nInternational response has been both immediate as well as overwhelmingly negative, with both the United States and the Empire of Japan, as well as many smaller nations, announcing varying levels of increases in conventional and strategic readiness levels."
 HGR.3.a:0 "Heil Heydrich!"

 HGR.4.t:0 "The Plot to Capture Speer"
 HGR.4.desc:0 "With the visionary nomination of Reichsführer Heydrich as his successor, Adolf Hitler has finally taken action to combat the rot allowed to set in under his later rule. However, while this action has strengthened the SS as a whole, it has also exposed us to our enemies.\n\nAmongst them, the most vocal is the leader of the so-called Reformist faction, Albert Speer. Removing him would be a great boon, and to this end the Reichsführer has issued orders for his ‘questioning’ by the RSHA on a matter as-yet to be determined. No fool himself, Speer has so far remained ahead of our officers by rapidly moving around the Reich and only appearing at public events in areas where he commands much, and we command little, support.\n\nThis will not last forever. He may have the support of the corrupted Bolshevik ‘students’ who occupy our universities, and from those in our government who foolishly consider National Socialism in need of reform, but we have the dedication of true Aryan soldiers. And guns.\n\nWe will find Speer, we will deal with him, and then we will take the fight to our other enemies, securing the future of the Reich forevermore."
 HGR.4.a:0 "For the unity of the Reich!"

 HGR.5.t:0 "Himmler's Dissatisfaction"
 HGR.5.desc:0 "With our failure to make significant advance from our loyalist areas in the Bürgerkrieg, despite significant assistance from the Ordensstadt, Reichsführer Himmler has decided to effect a change in command.\n\nCiting the unacceptably low morale, discipline, and political reliability of our armed formations, and the chaos pervading our rear areas and urban centres, he has ordered the immediate, and permanent, removal of Reichsführer Heydrich from his command over the state.\n\nThe territory of the former German-SS will be directly integrated into the Ordensstadt, reliable National Socialist officers will be integrated into its military, and the treasonous elements that have permitted this state of affairs, amongst them Heydrich himself, will be purged."
 HGR.5.a:0 "You have failed me for the last time, Heydrich."

 HGR.6.t:0 "Speidel's Germania"
 HGR.6.desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of Speer’s Bolsheviks, Göring’s puppet masters, and Bormann’s corrupt functionaries the SS, the guardians of National Socialism and of the Aryan race, have taken control of the majority of the Reich. Victory, and the salvation of the Reich, is finally within our grasp.\n\nBut there remains one last obstacle. Speidel’s military clique, which seized control over Germania and the capital region at the outbreak of the Bürgerkrieg, remains. And it must be dealt with.\n\nBut we must not grow overconfident. Victorious as our legions may be, they are also badly depleted and overextended. In contrast, Speidel’s forces are fresh, concentrated, and have had months to fortify their positions. And as corrupt and decadent as his clique may be, the military skill of several of those who have sided with him cannot be denied.\n\nWe will be prudent. Using our commanding strategic position, we will demand the surrender of both his forces and the capital to the only legitimate government still remaining in the Reich. We will avoid further casualties, further opportunities for defeat, and further damage to a country we will need to rebuild. Speidel will have one chance.\n\nAnd if he is smart, he will listen."

 HGR.7.t:0 "Speidel Bows to Heydrich"
 HGR.7.desc:0 "The seizure of Germania and the surrounding regions by Speidel and his clique at the start of the Bürgerkrieg was always seen as both help and hindrance.\n\nIt kept our enemies from acquiring control over the all-important capital, but so it also prevented us from doing the same. With the advance of our formations through Germany proper, we are now in a position to rectify this, and consequently forwarded the demand from the Führer for Speidel to surrender the city.\n\nHe has accepted.\n\nUnderstanding the inevitability of our victory, and wishing to spare our great capital of the damage that would accompany an attack, he has called upon forces loyal to him to surrender to our advance units. As far as we can tell, those forces intend to do just that.\n\nFor now, Speidel, Rommel, and the other leaders of this insurrection will be imprisoned, and when nobody is watching, they can then be quietly disposed of. For now, however, we will accept this great victory, parade into Germania, and plant our flag atop the Volkshalle."

As far as we can tell, those forces intend to do just that.\n\nVery well. Our forces have carried us to victory over our enemies so far, and what is one more?

Millions of soldiers and civilians have died on all sides, leaving the battlefield to younger and younger conscripts. Brutal urban combat over many months have left Germany’s great cities as broken shells, with great buildings and monuments in ruin. Collapsing medical and sanitation systems have led to sharp increases both in infectious and communicable diseases and in the rates of preventable death.\n\nAs what little is left is either consumed or destroyed, the situation can only continue to degrade.

 HGR.21.d:0 "Despite the resistance of Hans Speidel and his military clique, SS units have succeeded in establishing control over both Germania proper as well as the greater capital region, and have already begun fortifying the city in anticipation of potential counterattack.\n\nField Marshal Speidel has reportedly been captured by advance formations and is likely to soon face military trial, and the command structures of units formerly loyal to him have already begun breaking down.\n\nThe capture of the German capital has sent shockwaves through the factions still fighting for control of the country’s future, and the knowledge that even their combined efforts were insufficient to halt the advance of the SS legions has caused both domestic as well as international unease.\n\nThe people of one of the world’s great cities now wait, with bated breath, for what the imposition of an new regime will mean for them. Others still feel dread at the increasingly likely prospects of a total victory for the feared SS."

 HGR.100.t:0 "Burgundian Demands"
 HGR.100.desc:0 "Although we have won the Bürgerkrieg, our victory was only made possible through extensive support from the Ordensstadt. As such, there are now many things requested, required, and expected of us.\n\nWhile as of yet Reichsführer Himmler has not yet issued any orders, and although this is likely to change in the near future, he has emphasized the importance of the resumption and execution of pre-war plans as they relate to German society. The purging of political, cultural, and racial opponents, the installation of martial values along Spartan ideals, and the continued expansion of the SS into all sectors of government must all be accelerated to the greatest extent possible.\n\nBeyond this, we can likely expect more specific orders from Ost-Paris, now that the Reichsführer can be confident they will be carried out with sufficient zeal and discretion."
 HGR.100.a:0 "We will be ready."
 
 HGR.101.t:0 "THE BUNKERS"
 HGR.101.desc:0 "Directives from Reichsführer Himmler have arrived.\n\nWe are to, effective immediately, consider all domestic, military, and other initiatives of secondary importance, and begin leveraging both the human and mineral assets of the Reich to assist the Ordensstadt in the construction of extensive subterranean bunker complexes in the Alps. These complexes will allow for critical personnel and resources to survive in the case of an unrestrained nuclear exchange.\n\nIn addition, we are to also develop plans and preparations for the rapid evacuation of pre-selected government, military, and civilian personnel, those sufficient to re-establish the core of a functional state, to these complexes at a moment’s notice.\n\nThis project is gargantuan, an immense drain on resources for the war-ravaged Reich, and unlikely to be useful in the near, or even distant, future."
 HGR.101.a:0 "And yet, we have our orders."
 
 HGR.103.t:0 "1급 기밀"
 HGR.103.desc:0 "Heydrich watched with composed and undisplayed relish from the windows of the Chancellery as labourers tore down the statue of Hans Speidel.\n\nIt was one of dozens of monuments destroyed over the course of the day, each and every one representing one more degenerate who had chosen to betray National Socialism. But this was not to be the end - he had much much more in mind. A sharp knock at the door, and his barked response, disturbed his thoughts on the matter.\n\nA young officer, looking as if he had stepped out of a recruitment poster, entered, stood at attention, and raised his arm. "Mein Führer! We have received word, over the highest priority channels from the Ordensstadt, to expect an arrival. Imminently." The officer faltered as Heydrich’s cold gaze drilled into him, but he managed to continue. "It is to be a personal representative of the Reichsführer."\n\nHeydrich did not like it when Himmler treated him as a subordinate publicly, but he had little choice in the matter. "I see," he responded. "Clear them to land, and escort them here." Without another word he moved to leave, the officer jumping out of his way at the last moment.\n\nHeydrich had not survived as long as he had in the Reich without recognizing momentous events. And he knew now that one was coming."

 HGR.104.t:0 "1급 기밀"
HGR.104.desc:0 "Heydrich knew he had been right the moment the helicopter came into view outside his window. Extremely small, blindingly fast, and entirely unadorned with markings of any kind, it was the kind of craft one used when what was to be conveyed had to be done so in person.\n\nAs it landed, a single man emerged, clad in the uniform of the Burgundian-SS and carrying a document case handcuffed to himself. Heydrich’s guards met him and moved to escort him into the Chancellery, and shortly thereafter there was another knock on his door.\n\nEntering before Heydrich could respond, the officer he raised the arm that wasn’t handcuffed to a case. "Heil Himmler! Heil Heydrich!" Clearly expecting a response to the ordering of the names, and being disappointed by Heydrich’s lack of one, a slight grimace flashed across his face as he lowered his arm. "Werner Grothmann, mein Führer, personal aide to Reichsführer Himmler."\n\nHeydrich returned the salute, and gestured for the officer to continue. "I have been tasked by the Reichsführer," Grothmann began, "with both extending his congratulations and also informing you about a very important...role that you have to play in the salvation of our people."\n\nHe indicated the satchel on his arm, and for the first time Heydrich could see that he was tightly clenching a cord that he recognized as belonging to military-grade incendiaries. Grothmann smiled. "My apologies, mein Führer. If this information fell into the wrong hands..."\n\nHeydrich understood entirely. A momentous occasion, indeed. Sitting down at his desk, he motioned for the officer to do the same. As Grothmann made sure the door was closed and began to open the satchel, Heydrich knew that his world was about to change. Forever."

 HGR.105.t:0 "1급 기밀"
 HGR.105.desc:0 "For all it portented, the meeting was surprisingly subdued. While the portfolio contained hundreds of pages, the most important part of the plans could, and was, summarized in a single sentence, which Heydrich read with great care.\n\n"For the eternal salvation of the Aryan race, and for the return of the Reich to uncorrupted National Socialism, decisive action must be taken."\n\nA very clinical way, Heydrich thought, to say that Himmler’s plan was to end the world.\n\nAs Grothmann watched, he read the portfolio, in its entirety, in complete silence. Heydrich supposed that the officer was watching him for any sign of resistance or horror, and if so, planned immediate action. Instead, all Himmler's envoy received was the sight, and sound, of Heydrich calmly turning each page.\n\nWhen he was finished, hours later, Heydrich pushed the portfolio to one side, withdrew a lighter from his desk, and set it aflame. When the fires had consumed it, as they would soon consume everything else, he turned to Grothmann and gave him something very few living men had ever seen. A smile.\n\n"When do we begin?""

 HGR.555.t:0 "Karl Dönitz Seizes Crimea!"
 HGR.555.d:0 "With the chaos engulfing the Reich, it has been easy to overlook Crimea, the Kriegsmarine’s bastion in the Black Sea. Communication with the territorial administration has been extremely difficult in recent days, and we now know the reason why.\n\nIn an announcement earlier this morning, Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz denounced both Reichsführer Heydrich and the SS as a whole, accusing us of ‘conspiring to deprive the German people of their safety.’ At the same time, marines and disembarked naval armsmen seized control over both Theoderichshafen as well as other strategic locations on the peninsula, displacing the civilian administration and arresting the few SS officers present in the region.\n\nDespite claims of neutrality, Dönitz endorsed Martin Bormann as the only legitimate successor to Hitler’s legacy, which the Party leader was quick to officially accept in a hastily-prepared statement.\n\nAlthough it may not seem as such, this is a serious blow to our cause. We cannot count on any vessel or officer of the Kriegsmarine, even those we have been strongly pressuring, to interdict international assistance to our enemies. We cannot count on marine formations or Kreigsmarine dominated industries to willingly serve under our banner.\n\nAnd what’s worse, we can expect exactly the opposite for Bormann and his corrupt Party clique."

 HGR.130.t:0 "A Minor Security Flaw"
 HGR.130.d:0 "Earlier today, SS and SD officers in charge of security for the Chancellery reported that last night, a number of cameras around both buildings stopped working.\n\nBoth security forces on regular duty as well as those specially dispatched reported no detected intrusions.\n\nAlthough likely a coincidence, we must not become complacent. As such the maintenance crew has been punished, new cameras have been installed, and security patrols have been increased.\n\nThe Chancellery contains some of our most precious political and military secrets, and it must be protected accordingly."
